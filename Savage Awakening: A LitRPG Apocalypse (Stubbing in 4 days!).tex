\section{1. Boxes and Boxes}
\par
Zane wiped a line of sweat off his face. The air conditioner was broken again. This time of year, the warehouse became a 30,000 square foot sauna—even at night, when his shift took place. Whenever he moved his arms, he felt his shirt sticking uncomfortably close.\par
For the umpteenth time, he wondered what he was doing here.\par
Two years ago, he'd been a student wrestling for his local state school. He was the scrawniest guy there, but he was also last to leave the mat every practice. By junior year he was placing at regionals. He’d started training boxing to blow off steam, and he’d even racked up some wins as an amateur.\par
Then he messed up his knee on a bad shot.\par
A friend had once observed that if everyone else's emotional range went from zero to ten, his was from four to six; he just didn't get very high or very low. It was why he loved fighting so much: it was only when he let himself go, when his heart ran wild and his blood coursed hot in his veins, that he felt alive.\par
As it turned out, his friend was wrong. Zane could get very low. After his injury he was stuck at an emotional zero for over a year. He put on nearly fifty pounds, flunked out of college, and his girlfriend since high school left him for a guy who looked suspiciously like him, only two inches taller—he might’ve found it kind of funny if it hadn’t happened to him.\par
Now his life was boxes. Moving wood boxes in a bigger steel box. The wood boxes were all kinds of rectangles, big and small, all gift-wrapped with masking tape, all the same shade of dull brown, all needing to be moved from one rack to another, stretched out endlessly rack after rack. Sometimes when he saw them at a distance stacked side by side, they looked like dates on a calendar. As he went from box to box he could almost feel his life going by.\par
The only thing he liked was that there was hardly anyone here; all he could hear were his footsteps echoing through the cavernous space. There was something vaguely sci-fi about being stuck under nauseatingly white LED strips, caged in by flat steel walls, alone in the dead of night.\par
The hours crawled on by, and he finished up. He tapped his badge and clocked out. His ride waited for him: a baby blue 1998 Toyota Prius he’d nicknamed Bailey, rusted so badly it was more brown than blue. It took a couple of tries to get it going. It was a miracle the thing still ran, and he probably should have junked it long ago, but he could respect a thing that was broken and kept on going.\par
As he drove down a long, straight stretch of road, the first pale fingers of daylight reached over the horizon, grazing a wall of deep fuzzy green. This part of Washington State was pretty much all forest.\par
It was a new day, but all he was thinking about was showering, slurping down instant ramen, and dissolving into his shitty little mattress. He'd picked it up at a yard sale and it was missing half its springs, but after the shift he'd had he figured even concrete would feel like memory foam. He was getting a little woozy; his head felt light. He probably shouldn't be driving.\par
\par
Initializing System…\par
\par
He blinked. He put his hand through the box. "What...?"\par
\par
Terraforming... \par
\par
He must be more sleep-deprived than he thought. He blinked; it was still there.\par
Then his world started to tremble.\par
He thought it was his car acting up at first, but the rattling was so bad he felt it chattering his teeth, jittering his fingers; it was hard to see. Then there was a violent lurch and his face crunched against the steering wheel. His mouth gushed salt and iron.\par
“Fuck!” He gasped—or he thought he gasped—he couldn't even hear himself. There was a noise so huge it drowned out the world, deeply reverberating, like the earth itself was crying out in pain. Was he seeing things, or was the road narrowing? It was like the road was a fault line and the ground on either side of it were rushing in, spitting waves of gravel—\par
He looked left and saw the treeline rushing at him. There was a shattering of glass. Everything went dark.\par
\par
***\par
\par
He woke up groaning. “Fuck.” His head throbbed mightily. He touched his temple and his fingers came away bloody.\par

He blinked. It was eerie — they looked just like the notification boxes in the MMORPGs he played to unwind from work. It used game language too—Dungeons? Safe Zones? \par

\par
Were they some kind of projection? But they followed his head when he turned. He tried grabbing at them but they flowed over his fingers. They didn’t seem to be anywhere—it was like they were in his head. The last of them faded away.\par
\par
Warning! Health under 50\%!\par
\par
Hold on—what?\par
He was feeling a prickling of panic, which was a very bad sign. His feelings were usually a poor indicator of how he ought to be reacting. His slightly panicking was normal person hysterical screaming—which meant he should probably be feeling quite concerned right about now.\par
He glanced down. His leg was bent in three places, all the wrong way. “Yep. That’s… definitely broken.”\par
A long pause.\par
“Well, shit.”\par
He supposed the first step was to find his car, then get to the nearest hospital. Wherever these game hallucinations came from, he could deal with it later.\par
Only, where was his car?\par
He must have crashed it somewhere. He couldn't be too far off the road. He got up to a knee.\par
Then the pain in his other leg hit him all at once. “Fuck!” \par
He heaved in a deep breath. It hurt like a motherfucker when he moved it. It hurt slightly less when he didn't. But there was no choice, really. Hissing, he hopped to a foot.\par
Then he noticed the grass was purple. And glowing. And there were motes of blue light floating about like stringless lanterns.\par
And the trees. Those were not Washington trees. He’d lived here his whole life—he would’ve remembered trunks that twisted like coiling pythons, rising to glowing turquoise canopies so thick they let in only slivers of sun. There were flowers big as his arm, a shade of purple he’d never seen before. Everything here seemed bigger. Either that, or he’d shrunk.\par
He supposed he could be in a dream. He was pretty sure dreams were not supposed to hurt this much, though. He was well past the point of ‘pinch me’.\par
There was a thumping in the distance, to his left, coming closer. It sounded like pattering feet. His first thought was, oh good. Someone's here to help.\par
Then something burst out that made him think he might be dreaming after all.\par
Pointed teeth, long nose, sharp ears, with skin the color of vomit. Sickly yellow eyes met his own. The thing hardly came up to his waist. In its hands was a spear—fun-sized, but the stone tied to its end still looked sharp enough to run a man through.\par
More boxes popped up.\par
\par
Goblin\par
Essence Level 1 \par
Type: Monster\par
\par
Warning! Monsters are corrupted beings, lacking souls. They are highly malevolent. For the safety of its subjects, the Imperium recommends their immediate extermination.\par
\par
He blinked.\par
“Uh. Hello?”\par
It bared its fangs, screeched, and leapt for him.\par
Shit! \par
He threw himself to one side, and its spear went sailing past, barely missing his neck.\par
He scrambled up, and the next strike cut a burning line down his chest.\par
Okay, fuck this thing.\par
The next time it came in its dumb straight-line charge, he ducked the spear and clobbered it in the face. Howling, it stumbled over itself. He tried to pursue. Then he was promptly and painfully reminded that his leg was quite broken. He could only watch as it backed off, gathering itself for another try.\par
This time it came in wary. It jabbed, and when Zane grabbed at it, it hastily backed out of range. No more mad charges. It kept circling to Zane's bad side, poking at his arms. It was surprisingly hard to turn when he had been used to doing it with two legs his whole life. The goblin started cackling. It could just keep poking and poking and poking until all the blood leaked out of him, and they both knew it.\par
\par
Warning! Health under 25\%\par
Health effect: Heavy Bleeding\par
\par
He didn't need magic boxes to tell him he was screwed. That was pretty obvious. His heart rate had been pretty steady up till now, but he could feel that familiar heat rising in his chest, coursing down his body, an old friend who hadn't visited him in a very long time.\par
He started to smile, just a little.\par
The goblin frowned. Zane had seen that look before in bouts—when he was getting thrashed and his opponent was wondering why he wasn’t getting scared, or losing hope; why he looked so excited. As far as he saw it, the match only started when he got warm, and he was well warm now.\par
He’d had an idea.\par
This time when the goblin came in, he timed it. The spear flashed up. So did his hips. So did his useless dead weight leg, whipping out in a wide arc—a kind of shitty flopping kick. If you couldn't use it, might as well put it to some use, right?\par
The neat thing about his leg being this badly broken it didn’t need to obey the joint. It flopped right into the path of the spear, a zigzag of flesh—it was hard not to hit it. Sure enough, the spear stuck his calf and stayed there. He hardly even felt the jolt of pain. His smile grew feral. “Gotcha, you little shit.”\par
Even the goblin looked shocked—and a little grossed out. It went to yank the shaft out.\par
But Zane finally got his hands on the shaft too. It tried fighting him for it, and he headbutted it in the face, heard a satisfying crunch. It went flying, howling. The spear was his.\par
\par
Warning! Critical health!\par
\par
Maybe it was the shock, the pain, the lack of sleep, or the blood loss, or maybe he was just having the most fun he could remember in a very long time. The goblin gaped at him, and he drank in the fear on its face. Then it turned to run.\par
He launched the spear.\par
It caught the goblin clean in the center of the back and buried itself a fist deep. With a squawk, it dropped.\par
Zane couldn't stop grinning. There really was something wrong with him. But whatever this crazy dream was, he was starting to hope it’d never end.\par
Then the goblin started to glow.\par
“…Eh?”\par
It was dissolving into motes of fuzzy white light. At first they were pinpricks like a starscape spread against its skin. They spread fast, until the whole thing was one glowing mass.\par
It rushed for Zane. He tried dodging, but the light-river curved to follow—he could only brace as it poured into his chest. A tingling warmth blossomed where it touched.\par
Level Up! \par
\par


\section{2. Class Selection }
\par
Level up!\par
There was a flash of blinding white light; when it faded, he felt nothing. A conspicuous nothing. No throbbing in his head, no pain lancing up his leg. He felt oddly, impossibly... fine. Healed.\par
Blinking, he got to his feet. His sweatpants had been shredded to bloody fluttering strips, but his leg was whole underneath. He touched the flesh. It felt fine. How? He took a couple of steps, shook out his leg, bent the knee, kicked the air.\par
"Fuck..." He breathed. Not just healed. Fully healed. For nearly all of the past two years, there had been a dull ache in his knee, courtesy of his injury. It flared especially hot when he squatted. Now he bent down all the way, and savored that beautiful nothing.\par
It was such a little thing, but he was stunned. He hadn't known how that pain had affected him until he was without it. It was like every moment was at least 10\% worse, and eventually he'd gotten used to it, stopped noticing it; it was like a constant debuff. For two whole years, he hadn't felt like himself, not really.\par
…’constant debuff?’ Really? This game stuff was getting to him.\par
\par

\par
Huh. So the level-up brought a stat screen. The stats he could understand. The others—Titles, Law, Spirit Tool, meant nothing to him.\par
And what was with ‘essence’ in front of level? He’d assumed the bright stuff that goblin gave him was like experience points. Was that essence?\par
He shook his head. He'd really started taking this seriously, hadn’t he? Then again, why not? Might as well have some fun with it, whatever it was, while it lasted. He was having a good time.\par
\par

\par
Even the classes were RPG-like. He didn't have to think twice. He always chose the bruisers. Sometimes he liked playing mage too, but there was nothing quite like getting up close and personal with it. Of course, Warrior.\par
He made the thought form the intent, and the screen faded away. Was it that simple?\par

Mini-map unlocked!\par
In the top left corner of his vision, a tiny translucent map popped up. He found he could blink it away and summon it again at will. The title read, ‘Luminous Forest (F),’ and it was split into three regions—the ‘Emerald Woods,’ the ‘Crystalback Highlands,’ and the ‘Grove of Whispers.’\par
It was simply drawn, dashed with bare lines to mark out basic topography and boundaries. The white dot was him, he assumed—he was in the ‘Emerald Woods.’\par
Weren’t there three bosses? He frowned. What were they, again? He tried remembering, and the box popped back up—\par
\par
1. Slay the Hobgoblin Chief\par
2. Slay the Crystalback Behemoth\par
3. Slay the Keeper of the Grove\par
\par
Right—he thought the regions sounded familiar. The ‘Crystalback Behemoth,’ whatever it was, had to be in the ‘Crystalback Highlands.’ The ‘Keeper of the Grove,’ was in the ‘Grove of Whispers.’ Which probably left the ‘Hobgoblin Chief’ where Zane was. He’d just fought a goblin. Made sense.\par
It seemed he could only make out red dots within a certain radius of him, since the rest of the map was blank. They were moving. RPG logic said they were monsters. But there were yellow dots too, stationary, and those he was less sure of—save areas? Traps? Treasure boxes? He was guessing; he’d have to check them out. That, and all the skills he’d just been thrown.\par
First, though, he still had one free point from that level up. Again, the choice was pretty easy for him; he willed it into strength.\par
He didn't feel much stronger afterward either; other than a mild tingling, he didn't feel much of anything. On a whim he walked over to the nearest tree, cocked back a fist, and rammed it with a right hook.\par
His fist went a foot into the bark, and the whole tree wobbled, dirt rucking up at its roots. Pale, crystal blue fruit fell like giant raindrops, splattering against the ground, hissing as if there was acid in them. Zane looked at his fists in consternation. The knuckles were scraped bloody raw.\par
Either the trees here were made of tissue paper, or...\par
“Holy shit,” he breathed.\par
\par
***\par
\par
He wasn't sure when the transition had happened, but he was in. Whatever this was, he went along with it. Some part of him believed.\par
He set off deeper into the forest at a brisk pace, feeling pumped. By this time of day, he should have been so sleep-deprived he was barely functional, but he felt fresh, like he'd just woken up. His mind knew the fight was over, but his body was still running hot; he was fiending to get his hands on something, to play with his new toys.\par
On the way, he saw a white-furred mother monkey swinging from branch to branch, cradling a little one. It trailed a light mist as it went.\par
\par
Frostmonkey (Creature) \par
Essence Level 2\par
\par
It didn’t show up on his map.\par
They blinked at each other; it looked slightly spooked, like it thought Zane might come for it. He supposed he gave off that impression—he had strong features, and at rest, his expression was so flat his gaze was more intense than he meant.\par
“Go on. Shoo,” sighed Zane. It went.\par
He was no bully. He needed a worthy foe, a foe that deserved it. Another of those goblins, maybe, or some other monster. The system had said they were soul-less killing machines, or something, right? At the thought—\par
\par
Warning! Monsters are corrupted beings, lacking souls. They are highly malevolent. For the safety of its subjects, the Imperium recommends their immediate extermination.\par
\par
Right. His goblin run-in backed it up well enough. Sure, he’d play pest control.\par
He made for the nearest red dots—there were two of them.\par
He took in the Forest as he went. Little stone statues of what seemed like gnomes and gargoyles, fuzzed with moss, draped with vines, dotted the land. Their hollow eyes seemed to follow him as he went. He saw butterflies flitting about with wings like tiny mirrors, and vines sneaking around trees that seemed to whisper at him as he passed in some secret language.\par
The red dots were heading his way, so he crept around to get a closer look. Through a weave of vines and wood, he saw them—the backs of bobbing green heads. He crept closer, and the rest of them came into view.\par
\par
Goblin (Monster)\par
Essence Level 2\par
\par
Goblin (Monster)\par
Essence Level 2\par
\par
He thought about sneaking up on them, taking them from behind, unawares. But where was the fun in that? He wanted a good fight—he wanted to see the whites of their eyes, to feel his heart beating so hard it might burst out of his chest. He wanted to feel alive.\par
So he dashed straight for them.\par
They whirled almost instantly. Yellow eyes widened. Then they let out shrill, spittle-flecked screeches, and their spears flashed up to greet him.\par
He ducked.\par
Then he ripped one of them to the belly, felt the satisfying squelch of knuckles digging deep into flesh, heard its strangled choke. Then the other one tried bringing its spear around to jab at him, but he got in too close. He tackled it, and they went tumbling over, clawing at each other. He ended up on top. Before it could get up, he rammed an elbow up its nose, heard it crunch. There was an awesome force in his hands, in his arms—it felt like he was dropping hammer blows. He slammed another, and another –\par
His back erupted in pain. He whirled and saw the other goblin circling. The tip of its spear was coated red.\par
He was starting to smile.\par
He picked up the fallen goblin's spear. It fit snug in the palm of his hand, and he tossed it from one hand to another; somehow, he knew just where to grip it to keep it balanced. Armed Combat I, eh? \par
The goblin launched itself at him. Its spear shot for his throat. But he had the same idea, and his arms were longer.\par
For a few moments, it gurgled, thrashing; then it went limp. Its body dissolved in a rush of white light, and its essence was released.\par
Zane turned back to the goblin on the ground. It was groaning, trying to scramble to its feet but couldn't see through all the blood leaking into its eyes. He put it out of its misery.\par
\par
Level-up!Essence Level 2 -> 3\par
\par
A flash, and the pain in his back vanished.\par
His whole body tingled warm, and when he hopped around, he could feel a little extra spring in his step. At this level, it felt like he had a new body every single boost.\par
It wasn't enough.\par
He'd won, but he’d barely gotten warm. Coach was always on him about this. Zane cared less about winning than having a good fight. Winning was nice. But to Zane, a good fight was a different way of being alive. Those little moments, those beautiful moments when he was locked in a cage, and pouring out his soul and blood and sweat, pouring out all he had, win or lose—it made real life feel like sleepwalking.\par
In high school, he'd read a quote that’d stuck with him ever since. It was his favorite quote, from a famous tightrope walker—"Life is on the wire, the rest is just waiting."\par
He was done waiting.\par
Even now, he could feel himself cooling, could feel the light leaking out of his world. No, no, he needed a hit of the stronger stuff. There was another dot nearby—a couple of hundred feet out, by the looks of it.\par
When he got there, he saw this one was no goblin.\par
It was much bigger, laden with cords of muscle like goblins gone through puberty. Its spear was a grown man's spear. It was at the bottom of a hill, half-hidden in the foliage—it hadn't seen him. But he could make it out just fine.\par
\par
Hobgoblin (Monster)\par
Essence Level 5\par
\par
Five? That gave him a bit of pause. If leveling worked for them like it worked for him, that thing could be a lot stronger than him. He probably shouldn't do this. He should probably run.\par
One problem. If it was level ten, he would’ve run. Maybe even eight.\par
He didn’t have a death wish—it was no fun getting mauled. But five was close enough he could just about convince himself he could bridge it. And if he couldn’t—well, he’d have fun on the way down, wouldn’t he?\par
Why was he so damned excited? He was shaking. It's been so long since he'd had a proper fight—then that goblin had given him a taste of it—it woke a hunger in him; he needed more.\par
…Jesus. He sounded like an addict relapsing.\par
It did kind of fit him, didn't it? After his knee gave out and he couldn't fight anymore, that huge depression…were those withdrawal symptoms?\par
Had he been addicted? It sounded kind of absurd.\par
He stopped thinking about it. Fuck it. Just this once. If it fucked him up, he'd be good and stick to Monsters his level. Just this once, then he'd stop, he swore it—\par
He blinked. He just had a startling realization about himself. “…Damn.”\par
Then, shrugging—“Eh.”\par
He put his unused level-up point into strength. He had a feeling he was about to need it.\par
Then, grinning, he charged.\par


\section{3. Picking Fights}
\par
The hobgoblin whirled to face him, a growl tickling the base of its throat—\par
Zane chucked a spear at its head. He’d picked it up from the two goblins just then. He figured he could make good use of them.\par
The hobgoblin reacted like anyone would react when a spear was thrown at their head. It ducked.\par
Then the other spear slipped neatly into its belly. Distract it with a shot up high, then strike down low. He was feeling pretty good about his little trick.\par
Until he looked up, just in time for the hobgoblin spear to crack him so hard the shaft snapped into showering splinters. He went reeling, gasping. \par
So his guess was unfortunately right. The hobgoblin was much stronger than him.\par
He wobbled back, trying to get his bearings. The hobgoblin wrenched the little spear out of its gut, but the head was still lodged inside. Snarling, it tossed the shaft. Then it came for him shrieking, fists flying.\par
Something was bleeding on Zane's face, his nose, his lips, both. He licked his lips, tasted his own blood, and grinned a bloody grin. \par
He clocked it hard in the ear and slapped it up with a hook. Then he took a claw to the gut and fist up the face.\par
Warning! Health under 75\%\par
That fast?\par
He’d love to go punch for punch with this thing. Sadly, it'd probably kill him. When the thing punched him, his head rattled like a gong; it was still buzzing.\par
So the next time it swung, he dove for its legs. They bowled over each other. It slapped chicken wing elbows at Zane’s head; he felt its spittle searing his eyes. Then it devolved into a catfight, slapping, crawling, punching, awkwardly flailing. Neither of them could get to their feet. When one tried scrambling up, the other dragged it down, and they were tearing at each other again.\par
The problem was, it seemed to be doing a much better job of it. Zane's eyes were swelling shut; his torso felt like a block of wood, just one rigid stretch of burning pain. His head felt woozy, far too light—\par
Warning! Health under 50\%\par
It bit at him. Oh, is that what we’re doing? So he bit back, latched onto a flap of ear, and jerked his head like a bulldog gnawing a bone. The hobgoblin howled—with one last jerk Zane tore it clean off, and grinned. Then, as the hobgoblin clutched at its bleeding ear he jammed a thumb into its eye. It howled louder, cringing, turning away from him.\par
He got his arms around its throat and firmed a chokehold. \par
It gagged, it slapped at his head, left bloody marks streaking down his face, but he wouldn't let go. He was grinning like a madman now; he just had to hold this; he had it locked tight. Just a little longer, and there'd be no more blood going to the thing's brain. It tried clawing at his arms, but they were locked too tight. It tried elbowing him in the ribs, but when Zane was this hot pain lost all meaning. He started to laugh.\par
Warning! Health under 25\%\par
Then the hobgoblin bent over, like a football player preparing to sprint. Zane saw the giant boulder not twenty feet away.\par
Ah, fuck.\par
The hobgoblin ran for it. It probably thought Zane would let go. Any sane person would, when their skull was rushing at a shelf of stone.\par
But Zane was enjoying himself far too much, and he could feel the hobgoblin flagging, could feel it stumbling, its slaps weakening, getting desperate. He didn't even consider it. Instead, he held on tighter, closed his eyes, and told his body, Whatever happens, don't you fucking dare let go—\par
His face struck the rock, and all went black. \par
***\par
When he woke up, he was pleasantly surprised to find he was not dead. Instead, the hobgoblin was gone, and there was a box in his face.\par
\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 3->4\par
\par
He blinked at the stone and saw a little crack where his face had struck it. So apparently it worked. His body hadn’t let go. Neat. Sadly the battle fervor was past, and he was cooled now; he couldn’t properly enjoy his victory. Ah, well. It was fun while it lasted. \par
Shading his eyes, he looked up. The sun was hardly past midday. And there were plenty of red dots still left on his mini map…\par
He didn't consider himself a very complicated person. After today, it was clearer than ever—he was happy when he was fighting, he was unhappy when he wasn't. So he picked out the nearest red dot, and made himself happy. \par
By sundown, he'd leveled up four more times. He wasn't sure how many goblins that was, maybe a dozen? There was a hobgoblin in the mix, too. That one was level 7, and it had given him a good tussle. For that he was grateful. \par
Now he was calm again, and the stars were dotting the sky. He found a secluded spot in a nearby grove, an alcove hidden beneath a tangle of vines. There, he settled down and thought.If you come across this story on Amazon, it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\par
It was remarkable how easily he lost track of time in this place. He was starting to think it wasn't a hallucination or a dream. In some ways, it felt more real than reality. He certainly felt more alive in here than he ever had out there. \par
Even after hours, nothing had changed. This illusion, if it was an illusion, was still going. It didn’t matter, really—bottom line, he was here now, and he had to deal with it. How long could he expect to be here? Another week? A month, even?\par
He couldn’t be the only one in here, could he? He'd been so caught up in his hunting he hadn't really sat down to think about it, not until now. There were quite a few notifications he'd just skipped past, especially in the beginning. If he just thought back to them, would they—\par

Dungeons Generated: 114,183. \par
Safe Zones Generated: 0. \par
Area Covered: 196.94/ 196.94 million square miles.\par
That was the one. Most of it still made no sense, but he thought about that "dungeons generated" line and the area covered. When he looked up at the night sky, it was the same. He was just about in the same spot, only everything had changed around him—had been terraformed into a dungeon. Apparently, the rest of Earth had been changed too, or so the boxes said. They hadn't been wrong so far… \par
So what did it mean for him? \par
He found he didn’t much care. \par
He was always a loner—it was why he chose wrestling over sports like football. Talking to people exhausted him; he wasn't really close to many in real life. The closest thing he had to a friend was Daryl, a security guard at the warehouse, and even then, they communicated exclusively in passing nods. He had more luck with a few online friends he gamed with, but he only knew most of them by username. That was pretty much it. As for family… he hadn't spoken to his ass of a brother in years, nor did he want to. And his parents had passed years ago.\par
Which was all to say, he was pretty much alone. No one counted on him. He was free to do as he liked. \par
He leaned back on a bed of soft mosses and stared up at the stars. If he was honest, if he had a choice, he didn’t want to go back. He wanted to stay here and fight his heart out—fight until something big finally ate him. Sounded like a fun way to go. \par
He went to sleep smiling. \par
***\par
Next morning he did some poking around, and discovered he could pull up his stats just thinking about them, the same way he pulled up the mini map.\par

There was something strangely pleasant about watching those little numbers tick up and up. He usually found it hard to take pleasure in things most people liked. He was indifferent to most foods. He never cried at TV, movies, or books, and the only games he like were fighting games. That and chess, weirdly. \par
In any case, this scratched an itch he didn't know he had.\par
He also deeply enjoyed what his body could do now. His strength had gotten obscene. He could probably rip a tree clean off the ground, roots and all, if he wished. When he ran his body felt weightless. And his limbs—he’d never realized how poor his hand-eye coordination was before. Now his punches and kicks went exactly where he wanted them to go, and his balance was catlike. Once a hobgoblin had thrown kicked him off a hill, and he’d righted himself mid-air, caught a nearby branch, and launched himself right back. It all felt effortless.\par
And his body was a tank now. When those little level 2 or 3 goblins hacked at him with their spears, they barely left scratches; they’d be lucky to draw blood. His skin didn’t feel any less soft to the touch. But he was changing at a shocking rate. And he loved it.\par
He loved fighting for its own sake, but it was a lot more fun when you were stronger. \par
*** \par
He’d started out near the southern edge of the Forest, but he was steadily getting deeper in. The leaves were quickly thickening, and so were the vines—sometimes he mistook them for pythons. The tree-trunks started to look like roman columns, but badly twisted, barely holding up the canopy roof which glowed a soft purple. It was so thick now hardly any natural light got through. This stretch was stranded in perpetual twilight. \par
Then he saw something odd on his mini-map—a bunch of red dots clustered around a yellow one. Had he stumbled upon a bunch of bathing goblins, or something? \par
His mini map felt like cheating. With it, he could gauge where they were headed and flank them, getting a read on them before he descended. He was perched on the upper branches of a tree when he sighted the pack. \par
As for the yellow dot... but there was this odd tree—its leaves were scarlet and yellow, and when the wind blew past they seemed a burning bonfire. The trunk was silver, glistening softly. But what caught Zane’s eye were the dots of silver marked out starkly against the red leaves. \par
Were those apples? \par
Going by game logic, maybe yellow marked a treasure of some kind? It would make sense. Red was things that’d hurt him, yellow was things that’d help. \par
There was only one way to know for sure. He’d have to try a silver apple and see. \par
As far as he could tell, the goblins were mostly mindless. They let their hobgoblin leader tell them what to do. The goblins were mostly Level 4 or 5; the hobgoblin, a Level 7. \par
He wished they were higher leveled, but he supposed they’d have to do. \par
He walked up front-on. He let them get a good long look at him. Please. Please, give me a fight! \par
They tried, to be sure. The hobgoblin scored a mean gash that ripped him from shoulder to hip. That was all it could get off before he smashed its face in. The rest of the goblins were a bore; he almost didn’t even bother disposing of them, but they kept poking him, which annoyed him. So out they went. \par
He sighed. The deeper he got, the stronger the goblins, it seemed—but clearly he wasn’t deep enough.\par
First, though, the tree. He walked up to it and squinted at the Fruit. \par
Moon Fruit (F)\par
Sacred treasure of the Emerald Forest Goblins, jealously guarded. The Moon Tree’s leaves gather essence from the moon for a full cycle, and concentrate them in Fruit. A delicacy enjoyed twice per year by the Hobgoblin Chieftain and his lieutenants. \par
Fascinating—he was starting to get a sense for what ‘essence’ was. It was the stuff Monsters dissolved into when they died, but it was more than that. A kind of energy. Sometimes he could feel it gently coursing through him, the way he could feel his blood subtly pulsing through him if he paid enough attention. So far he hadn’t found a way to tap into it, but just having it gave him levels, it seemed—and with levels came power-ups. \par
Was that right, though? When he leveled up he felt this warm tingling sensation, the same feeling when a beaten monster’s essence flowed into him—like his essence was suffusing his body. Was it instead the essence that caused his powers to go up, where the game system was just a ledger? That didn’t seem quite right, either… \par
This ‘essence’ was magical, true. But it felt natural, like air. He had the odd sense this game system wasn’t natural. Like it was grafted onto reality; like it shepherded reality. \par
“Eh.” He didn’t care enough to keep thinking about it. He picked a Moon Fruit from a nearby branch. Its skin was smooth and cool to the touch, like metal. \par
If he guessed right… he raised it to his lips, and bit. \par
\par


\section{4. Moon Fruit }
\par
It felt like biting into a juicy peach—he felt all the fluid sensations, the sweet flavor, but there was nothing solid in his mouth, feelings without substance. Instead there was a burst of warm energy, and he gulped it down greedily. He felt it spreading down his neck, filling his chest, flowing to his arms, his legs... He took another bite, then another; his whole body tingled warm. It felt tremendously pleasurable, almost like a drug.\par
It took him five bites to finish the thing. On the last bite—\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 8 -> 9\par
How many more fruit are on this tree? He walked around the back of it, counting. Nine in total. Was he about to level up nine times? He felt a little lightheaded at the thought.\par
Then he picked them one by one and bit in. They were cool and delicious, and they didn’t fill him up at all—he could eat them endlessly. It took him hardly 10 minutes to swallow them all, and his view was speckled with status boxes.\par
There weren't nine boxes. Just four. Essence gained to level gain, he'd realized, wasn't one to one; it was still pretty insane.\par
When he downed the last fruit, and saw his level rise to 13, he got another pop-up.\par
\par
Class Skill Learned!\par
Titan’s Fist I\par
Channels the bulk of their strength and essence into a singular punch. This strike acutely focuses raw power. A simple yet devastating finishing blow.\par
\par
He blinked, and it was all there. The mechanism of learning was totally different from what he was used to. It was as though some ancient master had told him what the skill was, drilled him in it move by move, made him practice for years on end—and then wiped his memory, so all he had left was his knowledge, his ability. The process was skipped.\par
He could do it instantaneously.\par
That pleased him more than all the essence level-ups combined—a new toy. And he'd been wondering what he had all that essence for. By now he’d gathered it was something like mana; it should be used somehow, channeled. Finally, he’d picked up an active Skill.\par
He checked his stats:\par

He had been loading points into vitality and strength, letting his class upgrades take care of dexterity and speed, but he was getting to the point of unwieldiness, he felt. That last fight, the hobgoblin had skirted him too easily—he'd had to grope around for it before he got his hands on it; it was over then, of course, but he could do with a little foot speed for balance. The point went there.\par
Then he stalked out to a nearby clearing where he wasn't likely to be disturbed and flexed his hand. He mimed the movement in his head. In real life—in his prior life, he corrected himself—all these skills were concerned with the external, the movements of the flesh and the muscle. But Skills here needed the internal too. To throw the Skill, his essence had to flow through his hands, there and back—for this Skill, it went in winding loops. At the same time, he had to move his fist. That sync had to be perfect.\par
When he mimed it, they were. He tried again, stopping halfway—the essence rushed up, faded back, like a wave crashing on shore. Then he breathed deep, dug into his body, and threw.\par
His arm burned white-hot, his fist steaming with essence. Here goes nothing. His arm moved, and the world erupted in blinding white light. For a second, that was all he saw: the arm in motion, carving a crescent moon in the air, moving inexorably, brutally, to touch down on solid ground. The ground erupted; a shockwave spasmed through it; little fissures tore open, coughing up mounds of dirt; flocks of birds were scared into flight.\par
Then silence. Zane knelt in the middle of a smoking crater, panting heavily, and puked blood.A case of theft: this story is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\par
He looked down at his trembling hand—what used to be his trembling hand. This was some mangled clump of crushed bone and steaming flesh. He kept puking.\par
When he ran out, he dry-heaved. His head felt like it was being squeezed in a vise, his body scraped raw from the inside. So much essence had rushed out of him all at once. The dizziness was crippling. He tried standing, then wobbled to his knees instantly.\par
Okay. So when it said it was a finishing technique, it meant it. Holy fuck. He was pretty sure this would finish nearly any opponent with his strength. The problem was, it also finished himself. He thought his vitality was pretty damn high. Still, not high enough, apparently.\par
It took nearly half an hour before he felt like himself again.\par
***\par
He headed off to the deeper woods, to parts trapped in perpetual twilight. He felt no hunger, though he hadn't eaten in a full day; it seemed essence was enough to sustain him. Not sleep-wise, though—he still felt he needed about the same amount of sleep.\par
On his way there, he came across a scattering of goblins. He didn't bother picking them off. He met a hobgoblin, level 9, which might have made for an interesting fight a few hours ago, but now it seemed pathetically fragile to him. There was no need to use his ace. He waded into range, tapped it once to the belly, and then almost gently to the nose, and it pretty much exploded.\par
This deep in, his mini-map looked like a night sky, but instead of stars there were red monster dots—a buffet of challenges. He took his time sampling them; most were disappointments, little level 4 and 5 goblins, but there were a few hobgoblins tossed in there, though none that gave him more than a flesh wound. He wound his way slowly toward a cluster—a mass of red dotted around one yellow—and sure enough, it was another moon fruit tree.\par
This one's boughs were even thicker, and its trunk fatter too. Even from afar, he could see moon fruit glistening against the red. He had a suspicion there were far more than nine of them.\par
But it had more protection too. Ranged around its space was a hoard of goblins. And not just any goblins, but at the head of the pack, 3 hobgoblins: level 12, 10, and 10.\par
Finally. A real challenge!\par
He dashed out of the treeline and was among them before half of them could even react. A few wild swings mowed down a line of goblins, then the hobgoblins screeched and leapt for him. Spears flew, claws scratched. There were so many of them he wasn't even sure what he was hitting; he just made sure his fists found flesh every swing. He felt a spear split him up the side, then another nick him in the eye—way too close for comfort. He grabbed it as it went back and fed its base to the stunned hobgoblin who had thrust it. His health dropped past 75\%, but the goblins' health, he guessed, was dropping far faster than that.\par
Then a hobgoblin drove a spear clean into his thigh; the head went so deep when he looked down he only saw the shaft.\par
He was almost glad of it. He was starting to think this would be no challenge at all. Then he felt a harsh lurch of nausea, looked down at his thigh, and saw a creeping blackness visibly spreading.\par
Ah, shit.\par
He stumbled back, and their spears came flashing at him again. He batted one aside, slapped at another, missed—luckily, ended up accidentally punching a goblin coming up behind.\par
Then another spear caught him in the arm, opening up a deep wound.\par
All this wouldn’t have been so bad if it weren’t for the lesser goblins.\par
He hadn't realized until he was among them just how many of the little fuckers there were. He was focused on the hobgoblins, but the little ones could carve up their gashes too. They were gnawing at him, clinging to his legs…just the sheer heft of them weighing him down made him unwieldy.\par
\par
Warning! Health under 50\%\par
\par
The poison was quickly blackening his left thigh; it was hard to put weight on the leg. And though he had downed one of the hobgoblins and maybe half the goblins, the rest just poured in. He flailed against the wall of flesh, smashing, crushing, managing to shuck a few stragglers off him. But his wounds were fast adding up. From up ahead, the hobgoblins pincered in; from behind, goblins clung so tight to him he was reduced to waddling. All the while they let out a chorus of glass-shattering screeches. He could hardly hear himself think.\par
Warning! Health under 25\%\par
If he wasn't careful here, they might actually kill him, he was realizing.\par
Okay, change of plans.\par
He gasped; he stumbled forward. His blackened leg gave out on him; his head drooped. The goblins smelled blood. The little ones all pounced for him at once; the big ones came rushing in front. He waited until he felt the pain.\par
Then he did—a lance of pain up his back, another down his head. Underneath his bowed head, he smiled a vicious little smile.\par
If they could touch him, that meant he could touch them too.\par
How nice of them to put their bodies at arm’s length. \par
His arm glowed white-hot. He wound it back for the widest arc he could manage and pitched it like a baseball.\par
He couldn't tell what he hit; it didn't really matter. The force was so huge; every body part he touched shattered, and every body part that touched that part shattered too. A brutal chain reaction.\par
His fist drew a blinding crescent in the air. CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK-CRACK!\par
There was something satisfying about it. Like popping bubble wrap, but with bodies. Flesh blew out behind him, flesh burst to the side, blood balloons popping. He caught the first hobgoblin clean on the chin, and his fist passed through it like it didn't exist. His fist went through the second one's chest. It stared dumbly. Then it, too, exploded.\par
The neat thing about this world was all the bodies dissolved when they died, including the fluids. There was no need to clean all that blood off him; it took care of itself.\par
He collapsed to a knee, coughing his own blood, feeling the warmth of their essences stream into him.\par
Then he heard a shuffling sound and craned his head back.\par
He'd missed one—a Level 3 Goblin. Imagine that.\par
This was rather awkward, since he'd put every last drop of his powers into that one shot. He wasn't sure he could throw a punch if he wanted to. He could barely close his trembling hands in a fist. The thing could probably run in and poke him in the neck a few times, and he'd keel over.\par
He raised a brow at it. …Well?\par
It looked at him with such pure horror that, between the two of them, you would’ve thought he was the monster. It ran screeching. He giggled a little. He felt delirious.\par
Warning! Critical health!\par
Right, right, the bleeding and the poison—he should probably get on that. Haltingly, he dragged himself over to the tree, picked off the nearest fruit and ate.\par
He could sense when he was near a level-up; his body felt full, almost bloated with tingly warmth. So he expected what came next when he bit down—\par
Level-up!\par
Essence Level 13 -> 14\par
There was a brilliant white flash, and like that, he was fully healed.\par
He took stock of the rest of the tree. The boughs were heaving with Moon Fruit; there must have been more than a dozen of them, glistening, swollen with essence. Time for lunch.\par


\section{5. Life or Death}
\par
This Moon Tree had twelve fruits, and each soothed his throat going down; it felt like drinking a warm broth. He sat with his back to the tree, cross-legged, and savored them one by one. He kept leveling up, kept seeing the boxes pop up; each one tickled him.\par
By the end of it, he'd gone up to Level 19. With his three points, he shored up his speed and his dexterity some, but he put the bulk of it into strength and vitality. As for regeneration, it might be useful in drawn-out fights, but he didn't plan on getting in those.\par
His relationship to work had changed in here too. After a few hours moving boxes, he'd need a break—even if he was fine physically, his brain felt like it had been ground to a pulp. But here, the more he fought, the more he wanted to fight.\par
So he forged deeper and deeper into the Luminous Forest. At the Forest's edge, there had been little fuzzy balls of light floating around; those had all but vanished. This deep, the Forest grew gloomy, brooding. Bruised purple was the color of the day. The little critters he'd see scurrying about—the snow monkeys, the light bugs, the doves—were all conspicuously absent. Oddly, so were the monsters; he hardly saw any red dots on his mini-map, and those seemed far off. It was disconcertingly quiet.\par
Where did everything go? Maybe they’d simply wandered off to some other section of the map. It could be they were out fighting other people. Or other monsters. Still… something felt off.\par
Just as he was debating turning back, he saw a yellow dot pop up on the edge of his mini-map; it was a good deal bigger than the last few treasure dots he'd seen. And he also saw where all the monsters had gone.\par
They were packed so tight around that dot it looked like one solid red circle.\par
It turned out that treasure dot was a tree that looked like three Moon Trees stacked on top of each other. It was thrice as wide as a normal Moon Tree too. The top layer was a behemoth; it bristled with moon fruit, but the bottom layer, some dozens of feet off the ground, had its fair share too.\par
There were so many goblins milling about he couldn't count them all. But a few nearest to the tree stood out—hobgoblins. He squinted at them from behind a screen of foliage.\par
\par
Hobgoblin (Monster)\par
Essence Level 18\par
\par

Essence Level 14\par
\par

\par
He scanned the rest of the goblins. None were over level ten. He'd made the mistake of underestimating how hordes of low-level critters could add up, but with this level gap he was certain these things couldn't touch him. He’d be shocked if they could scratch him. Thet level 18 Hobgoblin might give him some resistance, but he figured he could do this horde like he'd done the last one. Easy.\par
When he first saw it pop up on the mini-map, he'd wondered if this was where the boss was, that Hobgoblin Chief.\par
But it was nowhere to be seen. He must not be deep enough. He tsk’d.\par
For this bunch, he figured a straight-up approach would do just fine. They were ringed around a tree in the middle of a clearing. The clearing was edged with tall trees, casting deep shadows, but once he was out of them he’d have to sprint a good twenty yards in naked light to get to them. He was hardly going to sneak up on them.\par
So he put up his fists and waded right in.\par
He was pretty spot-on in his analysis, as it turned out. The little goblins were annoyances, brushed off easily as insects, but these three hobgoblins were surprisingly coordinated. They each took a corner of a triangle around him, and each knew their way around a spear too. When he lunged for one, the other two would slash, and all the while, the mass of little goblins would get in the way. He had to take a couple of slices to the back to corner the level 14 Hobgoblin, but once he got it down, once he broke the formation, the other two had trouble keeping up. He kept swinging and swinging and swinging, and the horde of goblins dwindled to a handful.\par
His health dwindled below 50\% too. A few more swings and he was getting dangerously close to 25\%. They'd given him a good workout, but it was time to end things.\par
He used the same trick with Titan's Fist; he didn't even have to play at exhaustion this time. He'd been throwing like a madman. He was pretty gassed by then. Luckily, it seemed all goblins were alike—they saw him drop, got the bloodlust in them and charged him.\par
Titan’s Fist scorched the air. He drew one wide arc that splattered nearly all of them. His vitality had improved enough then. He could stay upright after a Fist now, just barely. He had enough left in him to pick off the stragglers.\par
He was pretty happy with how that went. Sure, he'd gotten roughed up, but he'd never felt in any real danger. He had fun. Solid fight—he'll pick off these fruit, level, and recover for a little, and be on his way….\par
He froze.\par
He spotted something out of the corner of his eye—a subtle flickering; the shadows at the edge of the clearing. Were they moving? \par
Why were there shadows here at all? There was no sunlight to cast them.\par
The shadows shifted, pulling back like curtains unveiling a stage.\par
And what stepped out were goblins. goblins upon goblins upon goblins, slobbering, yellow eyes veined giddy red, licking glistening white teeth.\par
All around the clearing, his mini-map lit up one bright circle of red. They had him totally surrounded.\par
"...What the fuck,” he said. They can cloak?!\par
Then a dot so big it seemed a bloodstain on his mini-map broke out of the pack. Zane looked up. A massive body stomped out of the dark. A wrecking ball of a potbelly, a leery yellow gap-toothed grin, and its eyes were even yellower. Every step it took shivered the earth. A giant, dented, scarred axe was slung over a shoulder.Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\par
Its body was glowing subtly, and shadows warped around him, as though distorted by some unseen gravity. This cloaking—this was its active skill!\par
\par
Hobgoblin Chief (Monster)\par
Essence Level 26\par
\par
The Chief roared at him, a horrible sound, a groaning and shrieking spliced together, painfully loud. He smelled the stench of it—the stinging, eye-watering blend of garlic and sulfur.\par
\par
Then he got a notification:\par
\par
Lair Lock: Grove of the Hobgoblin Chief\par
\par
A curtain of light blue rose up from the edge of the clearing, vanishing into the sky.\par
\par
The Hobgoblin Chief has locked its boss lair.\par
Clearance Condition: Kill the Hobgoblin Chief.\par
\par
Zane stared at it.\par
Had the Chief set this up? Waited until he’d been drawn into their trap and exhausted himself—and only then finish him?\par
For a few heartbeats he stood there stunned.\par
Then he snorted. He started to chuckle; he shook his head, smiling ruefully.\par
"Okay. Neat trick. You got me.”\par
He saw how things were. So. He was fucked, it seemed.\par
But he could still give them Hell on the way down.\par
His blood coursed, warming him; weirdly it helped him think. His blood ran hot, but his head was cool, clear. Maybe it was the adrenaline. He took in the ring around him—the speckled hobgoblins, the waves of goblins, most armed with spears. There was even a horde of archers.\par
Then there was him, with his health drain so close to nothing, nearly empty of essence. Him, and a Moon Tree.\par
All these things floated together in his mind, and slowly they began to congeal. He was molding them into a last-ditch desperate plan. But first he leapt with all his strength, straight up.\par
He flailed out a hand. For a second, he thought he might not make it. And his fingers closed around a moon fruit on the lowest bough; stuffed it into his mouth, and swallowed it whole in one gulp. As he hoped, it put him over the edge.\par
\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 19 -> 20\par
\par
A shock of bright light, and he was flush with life, flush with essence. Just in time, too. The Hobgoblin Chief roared and barreled at him. The edge of its axe was a wicked red, and it glowed with a skill's power as the chief swung. Zane barely managed to twist out of the way; it carved a deep, smoking fissure in the ground, leaking gouts of essence.\par
One good hit from that thing, and he was done. No way he could fight this thing right now—as he was, with all those goblins coming at him from behind.\par
So he ran. And the rest of the goblins came after him, both thrusting spears, jabbing. A hail of arrows shrieked by.\par
He had nowhere to run except around the tree. He ran in arcs, weaving through goblins; the Chief swung for him, bellowing, and every swing of its axe mowed down its own like so much grass. It didn’t care—it just wanted him dead.\par
Now he saw why they hadn't come for him all at once. There were so many of them they got in each other’s way. Half the shots meant for him fell on grunt goblins. The other half left blood welling up his arms, sure, but the sheer ungainly bulk of the attack might’ve been the only thing keeping him alive. He could wade through the chunks with the weakest goblins, take some skin wounds, and keep going; as they chased him they clogged each other up. It felt like running through briars. It sucked, but he’d live.\par
He leapt as he ran, grabbing for Moon Fruit—why were the branches so damned high? He managed to snag a few. He chomped them instantly. He was just too weak—first he had to level and take out the Chief’s most annoying minions, all at once. All while dodging for his life.\par
He bowled his way to a Level 15 Hobgoblin. He could hear the Chief’s furious roar, so close he could feel the heat of its breath on the back of his neck. He had to make this fast. The hobgoblin stabbed at him and he ducked, yanked its spear out its hands, and pierced its throat with it as he dashed by, one motion.\par
The Chief bellowed in rage; he heard its axe scream by so close he felt blood splattering on the back of his legs. Not his blood—some poor grunt goblin’s blood. He ran faster, making a beeline for a Level 17 Hobgoblin. It thrust his spear at him. He rammed his own through its heart. He had no time to pull it out again, so he simply took the spear it generously held out to him, and kept running.\par
\par
Level Up! \par
Essence Level: 20 -> 21 \par

\par

\par
He put his point into Vitality and kept going. With the level-up his spear went exactly where he wanted, as fast as he wanted. Hobgoblins fell one after another, faster and faster, and someone was laughing hysterically. He realized it was him. He chanced a look behind, and saw he’d put a good few paces between him and the Chief. It looked mad enough to explode.\par
He took the chance and descended upon the clump of archers, stabbing in a frenzy, leaving nothing but glowing fallen bodies in his wake.\par
But soon he saw his time was running out.\par
\par
Level Up! \par
Essence Level 21 -> 22\par
\par
The two sources of essence fueling his run—the essence of high-level hobgoblins, and Fruit he could reach—were fast depleting. And the buffer he had, the goblin horde, had thinned drastically too. He had smashed a fair few, but ironically it was the Chief that had cut through most of its own. There was an outer ring of goblins too scared to even get close now.\par
The Chief was gaining on him again; every time he glanced back his heart stuttered. He brought down a hobgoblin, then another, then another. When he snagged the last Fruit he could reach the Axe got so close shaved the back of his shirt, and leaving a burning hot line of pain. He hissed. That’d just grazed him—if he kept running, he had a sinking feeling the next one would do a lot more than that…\par
\par
Health Effect: Poison\par
\par
Fuck. \par
\par
He stuffed the last Fruit in his mouth. He had just under 75\% of his health left. He was dangerously close to a level up, but he wasn't quite there. There was no time.\par
He turned and gave the Chief everything he had.\par
This must be what those hobgoblins felt like fighting him. The Chief was enormous, slower, clumsier, but the power coming back was so awesome it didn’t matter. Zane stabbed at it, but all he could give the huge bastard were nicks. And he only barely managed to get out of the way as its axe raged by, steaming essence.\par
They played this dangerous game. For every few nicks he gave it, it cleaved for his head—it never caught him, not fully. But even the barest graze of its edge wiped out a chunk of his health. He didn’t want to know how little he’d done to it.\par
\par
Warning! Health Under 50\% \par
\par
He had only one real shot at this. That was to get close, close enough he could loose his Titan’s Fist. So he ran up to the edge of the Moon Tree.\par
The Chief swung furiously for him, and he dodged as late as he possibly could. He still took a deep gash up the forearm, but he got his prize.\par
The Axe was stuck neck-deep in the Moon Tree, for just a moment. And Zane pounced. Titan’s Fist!\par
He saw the Chief’s face light up with something nearing fear, then saw it go white with the light of his fist. With its free hand it smashed at his stomach.\par
It landed first. Its strength was monstrous. Sickening crunches rattled Zane’s body; it felt like his insides had been spontaneously turned to liquid.\par
\par
Warning! Critical Health! \par
\par
He’d been hit so hard it’d skipped right past 25\%. And that was just the Chief's normal punch.\par
But he was alive, if barely. And he got his blow in too. His fist met rough goblin skin; he felt something hard beneath give way.\par
Then an explosion of searing light rocked the world. Zane’s senses whited out.\par
When the world stopped trembling, Zane knelt there wheezing, and knew he was about to die.\par
He could only hope the Chief was too. It lay on its back, unmoving, its face a smoking blackened mass.\par
Then, snarling, it propped itself up to an arm. Then another.\par
Half its face was slag, caved in, melting off the bones. The other half—the half Zane hadn’t struck—was well intact. It was still angry, but there was a touch of fear in it now. Zane had wounded it bad. Well under 50\%, if he had to guess. It was over now, though.\par
This was what the Chief must have thought.\par
Slowly Zane began to laugh, a hysterical, gurgling, shaking laugh. The Chief took his face in, and stilled. It must’ve realized Zane’s last trick. It saw it in Zane’s open mouth.\par
He had stuffed that final Fruit in his mouth.\par
But he hadn’t swallowed.\par


\section{6. Savage Sage}
\par
Zane swallowed. Again.\par
He’d held the fruit in his mouth because he knew he was on the verge of a level up. And the level up came with one very specific perk.\par
There was a flash. Then he stood up, shirt all but shredded off his body, his trousers torn to limp strips, but underneath was cords of smooth, clean muscle. There wasn't a mark on the skin. Perfectly healed.\par
The chief's face went slack with horror. It tried to get up, even managed to stagger to a knee. No, you don't. “Round two.” \par
He took a step and full strength, full essence, he blasted a Titan's Fist in the Chief's face. Again.\par
It was like a bolt of lightning touched down. And when it vanished, it left a smoking heap. This time the Chief did not get up. \par
There was a deafening silence.\par
\par
The Hobgoblin Chieftain has been slain! \par
Objectives Complete: 1/3\par
\par
The Chief's body began dissolving to white.\par
All its minions ran screaming, but they didn't get far before they were stumbling over themselves, smoking into nothing too; it seemed once their boss went, so did they. And all that essence flushed straight into Zane, thick rivers of light merging to one.\par
\par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 23 -> 24\par
\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 24 -> 25\par
\par
Title Earned!\par
Goblin Slayer I [Common]\par
All attacks deal 3\% more damage to Goblin family Monsters\par
\par
He grinned stupidly. He was still drunk off the heat of the fight, but he felt himself quickly cooling. It took a moment to get himself to focus, take in the words floating before him. His first title—how neat. 3\% might not seem like a lot, but spread over dozens of strikes in the course of a battle, it’d surely add up.\par
\par
You have resonated with a Signature Title.\par
Signature Titles are unique in the Universe. They are passed down only to those deemed worthy. The Universe weighs mind and action, and it has found you worthy. \par
\par
Title Earned!\par
Savage Sage, 114th Incarnation [Signature]\par
For those with a cool head but a hot heart. The Savage Sage lives for the thrill of battle, yet remains clear-eyed under the most dire of circumstances: controlled chaos personified. Civilize the mind, but make savage the body. \par
\par
Skill: Sage Mind (Active) [Signature]\par
Deconstructs the enemy, gaining deep insights into their powers and weaknesses.\par
\par
Skill: Savage Body (Passive) [Signature]\par
Activates once the Sage's health drops below 50\%. Instantaneously increases Strength, Speed, and Vitality by 25\%. When health drops to critical levels, this effect rises to 50\%. This Skill does not Level.\par
\par
Zane reread the numbers. Then again.\par
What.\par
He thought about Goblin Slayer granting a 3\% boost to damage against only goblins. 25\%? 50\%?! These titles were not at all alike—if he assumed Common was the lowest rank, just how much higher was Signature?\par
What the fuck did I just get? He was reeling. This Title gave him the sense that it was something so huge, he couldn't even understand the implications of it from where he was standing. Even so, he could tell this was not normal.\par
Before he could think further on it—\par
\par
Level 25 reached. First-class evolution unlocked. Please select your class evolution.\par
Note: all class evolutions come with a Soul Weapon. It evolves with your class. Once chosen, it cannot be changed. \par
\par
He blinked, shook his head, tried to wrap his head around the new thing. Right. The system did mention that classes evolved. He’d been wondering when it would happen. He'd expected it at Level 10, actually.If you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\par
\par
Knight [Common]: Knights are armored guardians. They excel in defense, protecting allies, and holding strategic positions, but are also capable of meting out punishment. Knights are ideal for those who hold strong in the heat of battle, a balanced class. Soul Weapon: Spirit Sword I (Common)\par
Berserker [Common]: Avatars of raw fury, Berserkers are relentless in their attacks, thriving in the chaos of combat. They overwhelm their foes through sheer ferocity and grow stronger as the battle intensifies. Soul Weapon: Spirit Axe I (Common).\par
Gladiator [Common]: Gladiators are masters of the arena, skilled in engaging multiple foes with grace and efficiency. They blend offensive prowess with crowd control, ideal for those who enjoy a showy yet effective combat style. Soul Weapon: Spirit Spear I (Common).\par
Martial Artist [Common]: Focusing on hand-to-hand combat and agility, Martial Artists are swift and precise. They make lethal weapons of their bodies, ideal for those who prefer a more refined, technique-oriented approach to physical combat, valuing speed and skill over brute force. Soul Weapon: Spirit Gauntlets I (Common)\par
Iron Vanguard [Uncommon]: The Iron Vanguard specializes in resilience. Known for their ability to endure and counter heavy assaults, Iron Vanguards are adept at controlling the flow of battle through their unyielding presence. This class excels in defensive tactics, turning endurance into a weapon by outlasting their opponents, converting defense to offense. Soul Weapon: Soul Pavis I (Common)\par
\par
Zane was pretty close to selecting Berserker. It was a good thing he hesitated, because—\par
\par
Savage Sage grants you the choice of its signature class path.\par
Chain Reaver [Rare]: The Chain Reaver is where primal wrath meets the elegance of chain combat. Their chains are extensions of their spirits, transforming into weapons of war that wield explosive, suffocating power. The Reaver binds, and the Reaver reaps. \par
Soul Weapon: Prometheus Chains I [Signature]\par
\par
…If the other classes were Common, and this was Rare—and it came with a signature ‘Soul Weapon’, whatever that was… \par
That Berserker class, that axe, spoke to him. But he’d just seen the difference between Common and Signature. This was not a choice. \par
\par
Class Gained! Chain Reaver [Rare]\par
Level-up stat bonus: Vitality +0.6, Regeneration +0.2, Strength +0.8, Dexterity +0.3, Speed +0.1.\par
\par
Class Skill Learned!\par
Chain Mastery I (Passive) [Rare]\par
Enhances proficiency in wielding chain weapons, significantly improving attack effectiveness and precision in chain movements. The chain becomes an extension of your body. \par
\par
Class Skill Learned!\par
Chain Cyclone (Active) [Rare]\par
Executes a swift, 360-degree sweeping attack, a cyclone effect; an artificial natural disaster. This skill crushes surrounding enemies, offering both offensive reach and a defensive barrier. \par
\par
Spirit Weapon Unlocked!\par
Prometheus Chains I [Rare]\par
A tool of wisdom and fire, capable of binding and annihilation both. The Signature Weapon of the Savage Sage. Currently at the first stage.\par
Stage I Powers: Heavy to others, light to the Sage, its weight scales with the Sage’s level.\par
\par
He felt like he'd been struck by a whirlwind, and now that things had finally calmed down, it was time to assess the damage. He was still baffled by what just happened.\par
First, that Title. Savage Sage. Its description—that was him. Was it tailored to him? But that notification made it sound like it was the other way around; he was chosen for it. And as for his class evolution... chains? He was ambivalent about it. He never fought with chains before. He never played characters that fought with chains before. Did Kratos count? He was skeptical they could actually be used to fight. Light to the Sage, heavy to others, it said…\par
He could feel them there, like a new limb, waiting. If he wished, he could simply summon them and they'd come. So he did.\par
They burst into being mid-air, ranged before him like two great coiling serpents. He could believe these are chains meant for a God. It was pitch black, the blackest thing Zane had ever seen; it was not reflective at all—light went in and got swallowed whole. The links fit his grip perfectly, like they were made for him.\par
He saw all this while the chains were falling. Then they hit the ground, and he was thrown off his feet.\par
He stumbled back up and blinked. There were two new furrows dug deep into the ground, dust drifting over them. He swore. It wasn't kidding when it said these things were heavy. It wasn't kidding when it said they'd be light to him too; he could shuffle around just pretty easily, but every small shift made the earth groan.\par
He realized he could actually control the weight with his mind. Or rather that he had a kind of bond with it, and he could use that bond to carry most of its weight, artificially lighten it.\par
Could he move it around with his mind too? He tried, but all he could do was point it, steer it. No. He couldn't give it energy, impetus with just his mind; that had to come from its base, his hands. His mind would do the steering, his hands the throwing.\par
And it came so easily too, as though he'd been practicing for years. Chain Mastery did this? He lashed it up and down, and it undulated like a wave; it felt like cracking a whip. He took most of the weight with his mind, and it clattered like a common chain.\par
Then he put all the weight back and threw it casually to the side, and it flattened half the tree line. \par
Three big ones were almost fully decapitated, the trunks clinging on by a strip; wood chips showered everywhere. Through the gaping maw he’d torn in the canopy, he got a glimpse of blue sky. Sunlight burst through, making a golden pool on the twilight-purple ground. \par
Zane was quickly changing his mind. Yeah—he could see how these things could be useful in a fight.\par
Then he had an idea. He turned to the massive moon tree, cocking his head. He lashed his chains at it, curled them around the base, and yanked with all his might.\par
For a second, nothing happened. \par
Then it started trembling at the roots, and Zane yanked again, harder.\par
It burst clean out of the ground. It was like the chains were an extension of his strength stat. He felt the tree's enormous weight bearing down on him; the chains shook with the effort of it, but still he managed to turn it over in one slow revolution.\par
He shook it vigorously, and Moon Fruit dropped like hail into the crater the tree left behind.\par
Satisfied, he tossed the tree off to the side. It rolled over to join its fallen brethren, and Zane enjoyed a pleasant dinner on the goblins.\par
That was all very fascinating, but he felt to really understand what he'd just gotten, he'd have to test them live. Only all the goblins were dead.\par
It was time to move regions. He couldn’t wait until tomorrow. Next up: Crystalback Highlands!\par
\par


\section{7. Strange Reunions}
\par
Before he set off early next morning, he checked his mini-map. His dot wasn't pure white anymore; instead a golden S ran down the middle, presumably for signature.\par
He was up to level 28 now and had a host of unused stat points. Most still went to Strength and Vitality. But after the last fight, he'd grown a newfound appreciation for Regeneration. He stuffed a few points there too.\par
He headed on out. Yesterday, he was hosed with all kinds of new powers. He could sit there theorizing about how best to use it, but he'd much rather get a feel for it, get hands-on with it. So, he made his way due northeast. He didn't come across a single red dot. Once the Hobgoblin Chief de-spawned, it seemed that was the last of them.\par
It took about an hour of sprinting before he saw the terrain change. The thick twilight canopy, which had been so seamless, started to thin, started to leak streaks of sunlight. The vines thinned and receded; the towering trees shrank too, giving way to a thick underbrush which grew sparser and sparser as he went. The ankle-length grass was slowly replaced by patches of purple moss.\par
The tree line began to thin out quickly. By the time he neared the border, the ground grew rugged, and clumps of clear crystal sprouted from the ground, faintly glowing. Most dotted the landscape like prettier weeds, but some went up to his knee; he even saw one as tall as a man.\par
The landscape of the Crystalback Highlands was dominated by purple-fuzzed plains. The trees were clumped tight and spread much sparser, and he could actually see a blue sky streaked with wispy clouds. It was refreshing after so long in the pseudo-dark.\par
He followed his mini-map, trekking across the rocky ground, waiting for a red dot to pop up.\par
To his surprise the first dot he saw was white—a person? It wasn't moving. He drew closer and saw something else: two red dots quickly closing in.\par
He ran for it. He sprinted up a small hill, slid down the rocky ledge on the other side, and saw them. There was a little girl sprawled on her back. And not thirty paces away were two boars, frothing at the mouth. They had black fur and red eyes, and chunks of translucent crystal poked out of their backs.\par
\par
Crystalback Boar (Monster)\par
Essence Level 7\par
\par
Crystalback Boar (Monster)\par
Essence Level 8\par
\par
The girl was curled up in a ball, shivering. She cried out as they charged her.\par
Instantly, the Prometheus Chains were in Zane's hands. He chucked with all his strength. They whipped through the air; their long shadows descended on the monsters like guillotines. Then they struck.\par
The ground trembled with the impact, and the girl screamed louder. But when the dust blew away, then saw the aftermath—the boars' heads and legs were intact, but their midsections had been crushed nearly flat. They dissolved into streams of white light. Zane ran for the girl.\par
“You okay?” he said.\par
She wouldn't uncurl. She was younger than he'd thought; she couldn't be more than ten. What was a child doing in a dungeon? He stood there awkwardly, waiting. She finally looked up, sniffling. Her eyes were red-rimmed. "Are you—" she began. "Did Brad send you?"\par
Brad? Zane frowned; he had bad experiences with the name, but he brushed it aside. "No. I'm here on my own. Wait—are there others here?”\par
She looked like she was about to cry again. "Hey, hey," he said, crouching, speaking as gently as he could. “I’ve got you. You’re safe now.” \par
She wiped at her face. "Really?"\par
"Really," he assured her. "My name is Zane. I’m very strong. I won't let anything hurt you, alright? I promise."\par
She seemed to calm down a little. He used to tutor after-school math for elementary schoolers; it was pretty much advanced daycare. He was strangely good at it. One of the first things he was taught was kids went through all kinds of emotional ups and downs, but if you're patient with them and stayed calm, they'd latch on to that. He found it far easier than most of the other teachers—that was pretty much who he was all the time when he wasn't fighting.\par
"What's your name?"\par
"Annie," she said. \par
He just remembered—the system came with some kind of latent identity skill. If you just focused on her, inspected her closely—\par
\par
Annie Xu (Creature)\par
Essence Level 1\par
\par
"Okay, Annie," he said gently, "I need you to tell me what happened. Can you do that for me?"\par
Haltingly, sniffling, she did. She was walking back from ballet practice with her mom when suddenly everything changed. She saw boxes and she went to tutorial. Her mom protected her. Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.\par
"So, what happened next?" he said.\par
"Then we saw Brad, and Zach, and the rest of the tribe."\par
There was a whole group of stragglers he hadn't met?\par
Zane nodded. “Can you tell me a little about this Brad? I don't think I know him.”\par
“He’s big," said Annie, “Not as big as you. Um. But he said, he said he was gonna protect my mom and me..."\par
“And then?”\par
Annie shook her head quickly; she started crying again. "Shhh," he said, “You’re okay. You’re okay.” He sat there with her and waited patiently until she was ready.\par
"They—“ the little girl finally got out. She gestured at the place where the Crystalback Boars used to be. “They— they—” \par
It took two start-and-stop minutes to coax the full story out of her. There had been a Boar attack. It had scattered their tribe, and they'd all ran off in separate directions. Annie got separated from her mom. She tried finding them but must have wandered the wrong direction. Now she was here, alone.\par
“You were very brave,” said Zane. “Let's go find your mom, okay?” \par
"Okay…"\par
Together, they wandered up the mini-map. As they walked the plains, they passed some spots marked with a black X, but there was nothing there. Zane guessed that was where people had died.\par
After maybe half an hour of walking, a cluster of white popped up. "There they are," he said.\par
He sighted them in the distance, a ragged-looking crowd of a few dozen. They seemed to have sighted him too, since they sent a party out to greet him. There were five of them: a Warrior, a Ranger, two Mages, and two Priests, none over Level 12. Dirt-streaked, haggard men and women with wild eyes and wilder hair.\par
"What are you?" shouted the Ranger.\par
Zane frowned. “What?” \par
“On the mini-map. Your dot—what’s with the—the thing on it? What are you?” \par
"That's just a Title. I mean you no harm.”\par
Annie piped up. "He exploded two monsters that were trying to kill me! He's a good guy.”\par
They exchanged nervous glances. Then the Warrior nodded. "Come with us."\par
The rest of the tribe stood there waiting for them. There were a few elderly people, and just a handful of kids. The rest were young and hard-looking, dressed in clothes as torn as his were. Almost all of them were under Level 5. He was shocked at how weak they were, how drained they looked. Every face he saw was drawn with dark circles under their eyes, and the dead-eyed look—they looked frightened and miserable.\par
He'd been having the time of his life. He’d almost forgotten that by any normal standard, this place was hell.\par
A thin Asian woman pushed her way through the pack—"Annie?!" She cried, teary-eyed.\par
"Mom!" The girl dashed off, and her mother wrapped her in a long, sobbing hug. \par
Zane looked around. He didn't recognize any of them.\par
“False alarm, chief!” called the Ranger.\par
Then a familiar face pushed through, and he froze.\par
“Good man,” said Brad.\par
Brad. It was that Brad—Brad from high school. He’d been Captain of the football team, and for four years, Zane's worst tormentor.\par
Zane couldn't believe he was here. He'd put on weight since high school, had a grizzly beard and a paunch now, but Zane would recognize those cruel beady little eyes anywhere.\par
Brad must have recognized him too; when he saw Zane he stopped cold. "Holy shit," he said. “Is that you? Brick Walker! Yo Ralph, look who it is—shit, man. It’s been years!”\par
Ralph emerged, huge and lumpy, the one who would pin Zane's hands behind his back as Brad slid the centipedes down his shirt.\par
“‘Brick?’” said Annie's mother, blinking tearily at him. “Thank you, Brick. Oh, thank you!” \par
“No, Brick’s not his real name,” laughed Brad. “We were buddies in high school. That’s his nickname. I mean, just look at his face! It’s like that one emoji, you know, the stone head? It's like he has no feelings, he literally doesn't get mad, it’s insane! Oh, man. You should’ve seen some of the shit we did to him—" He got too carried away; when he saw the look on the woman's face, he must have realized how it sounded. “No, no, it wasn’t like that. We were just playing. Having fun, ragging on each other, you know—it's a guy thing. Tell her, Z.”\par
'Z'? Was he serious?\par
"How's your back?" said Zane dryly, and Brad flinched.\par
Zane had snapped exactly once. This was before he took up wrestling, before he learned to stand up for himself—back when he was just a shy, scrawny, awkward kid. The day after his parents’ fatal car crash, he’d broken down in the lunchroom—one of the rare times he let loose like that. And Brad decided it was a good idea to make fun of him for it. He’d tackled Brad through a wall. Brad had walked hunched for weeks.\par
"…Right. Uhh, pretty good, actually. Pretty good," said Brad, forcing an awkward laugh. "We're all friends here, right?” \par
Before Zane could retort, yet another painfully familiar face emerged from the crowd. Big blue eyes, fluffy blonde curls, and a soft, cherubic face. He stood there, struck dumb. \par
It was his ex-girlfriend Sophie. Spunky, artsy Sophie. They'd met in high school, and dated for four years after, and in the middle of the worst of his depression she said she couldn't be there for him anymore because his sadness was too toxic for her mental health, and her therapist said to cut people with negative energy out of her life. \par
"Zane?" She gasped. "You look… different." \par
Her eyes trailed down his body. In just a few days, all that fat he'd put on had melted off, unveiling slabs of hard muscle and a sharp jawline. Putting points into his physique had cleared his skin, firmed his muscles; he was pretty sure he'd even grown a few inches. With how shredded his clothes were, these changes were all blatantly visible.\par
Then he saw her new boyfriend push his way through. Zane’s replacement. Cale—he looked eerily similar to Zane; at the time, it had felt like she'd swapped Zane out for a less depressed version. Zane couldn't even hate the guy—he was a good dude, friendly, laid back, well-liked; Sophie said he ‘gave golden retriever energy’. It was petty, but Zane did take satisfaction in seeing that after his time in the dungeon, he was the taller one now.\par
“Jesus, it really is you! It's been too long—dude, you've gotten huge!” said Cale. Then Cale squinted, inspecting Zane, and his eyes widened. “Wait, you're level twenty eight? Where'd you get all those levels?! Yeesh.”\par
"Took out the Hobgoblin Chief,” said Zane evenly. \par
“That was you?” \par
He shrugged again.\par
Brad squinted at him, inspecting him for himself, and went wide-eyed too. “No shit…”\par
He saw the same look play across most of their faces. Shock, awe. Even a little horror. \par
Brad in particular seemed queasy. \par
\par


\section{8. Testing}
\par
"Thank God you're here,” gushed Sophie. "We really need you. I—“\par
"Hold on now," said Brad. He seemed unsettled. "I wouldn't go that far. But yeah, we could use someone like you. We're trying to get out of here—we figure that means getting rid of this 'Crystalback Behemoth' first, then going for that 'Keeper of the Grove.'"\par
“Sure,” said Zane. He still wasn't sure about this collective 'we.' Thus far, he'd been pretty happy on his own. He'd come here to return the little girl—he found he had no strong desire to play nice with these people, though. The few he knew, he didn’t like.\par
"So this is how things work here," said Brad. "I'm tribe leader. These—you know Ralph, this here’s Zach—these are my lieutenants, my second-in-commands. Then we have warriors, and then scouts. To get where we were, we all had to work our way up, earn our stripes, you know."\par
It had hardly been three days. He made it sound like they were all combat veterans. Zane stayed silent.\par
"So," said Brad again, as the silence got awkward. "We'd love to have you! I think you’d make a great scout, man. You’ll be in charge of mapping out terrain and carrying our gear for us. We'll see how you do, then we can talk about a promotion. How's that sound?"\par
He couldn't look Zane in the eyes as he said it. He'd been fidgety ever since he saw Zane's level.\par
Sophie frowned. "He's Level 28, Brad! And he's just killed the goblin boss. Shouldn’t he be a Warrior, at least?”\par
Sophie going to bat for him was a shocking turn of events.\par
Brad laughed nervously. "Hey Soph, I like you. So I'll let that slide. But you really gotta remember you're just a civilian. You don't talk back to me, okay? There's a chain of command here."\par
Sophie looked perplexed, but Brad's grunts—his lieutenants—frowned at her with their arms folded, and she shriveled. By her side, Cale seemed uncomfortable, but he didn't speak up.\par
"So," Zane said slowly, “If I'm understanding this right... I could wipe out this whole camp with one hand—“\par
Brad visibly flinched.\par
“—and you want me to... scout... for you. Play your lackey. And you say this with a straight face, and you expect me to agree.”\par
He smiled an amused little smile. Brad frowned. “Come on, man. You don't have to be a dick about it. So yeah, you're strong, but if you think you can take us that easy, you have another thing coming. Look, all I'm saying is you don't get to skip the line. How's that fair to the rest of us?"\par
Fair? It seemed to Zane Brad wasn't only stuck in an old way of thinking, a way that only worked outside this dungeon. He was stuck in high school. He meant to run this disheveled group like a clique, with him on top. Zane wanted no part in it.\par
"What," said Brad at the look on Zane's face, “You think you can just walk in here and take charge just because you're—you're—you're a little stronger than me?”\par
Zane had not been thinking that at all, actually. But clearly Brad had been; he was getting quite red.\par
“Doesn’t work like that, buddy!” Brad snapped. “This is my—" He caught himself. "This is our tribe. You follow our rules!"\par
"Yeah," said Zane, snorting, “Thanks for the offer. I think I'll go my own way."\par
"What?” said Brad, but he was already turning.\par
"Dude, don't be stupid! You can't make it on your own."\par
Zane didn't turn; he just kept walking. "I'll take my chances."\par
“Wait!” came a cry. He glanced over his shoulder and saw Sophie running over. He was about to ask her what she wanted when she latched onto his arm. “I missed you,” she whispered. “I'm sorry—I shouldn't have let you go like that, it wasn't right. I see it now, I really do. You think about me too, right?"\par
"Please let go of me," said Zane, as evenly as he could.\par
"No," said Sophie stubbornly. "Take me with you. I—ahh!"\par
He'd shucked her off. "It's not personal. You’d just slow me down."\par
There was a choked cry as he walked off.If you come across this story on Amazon, it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\par
\par
***\par
\par
So that was a strange detour. Now it was over, he went back to what he was here for: testing out his new skills and seeing if he could find the region boss.\par
It didn't take long before he crossed paths with another monster.\par
\par
Crystalback Boar (Monster)\par
Essence Level 18\par
\par
This one was a lot thicker and bigger than the others, with a mountain range of crystals on its back. It snorted at him when it sighted him, swirling crystal dust out of its nostrils.\par
First up, his signature skill: Sage Mind.\par
\par
Sage Mind (Active) [Signature]\par
Deconstructs the enemy, gaining deep insights into their powers and weaknesses.\par
\par
He activated it.\par
\par
Crystalback Boar (Monster)\par
Essence Level 18\par
\par
Skills: \par
Stone Skin I (Passive) [Common]\par
The boar's skin is as rough and durable as stone, granting a strong vitality boost.\par
\par
Bull Rush I (Active) [Common]\par
The boar undergoes a sudden burst of speed, often catching enemies off guard.\par
\par
Fascinating. Presumably, these were the "powers" portion the skill was referring to. He wasn't sure what in the box was meant to be a weakness… Ah. A spot on the boar's belly lit up red; it was highlighting where you should hit it.\par
As it came charging at him, he figured he'd test it. Mid-charge the boar’s body glowed with essence, and it shot at him like an arrow loosed from its string—the change of speed was shocking. Or would have been shocking if he hadn't known about it. But he did, so he calmly sidestepped and let it stumble over itself, hitting nothing.\par
It swerved, came at him again, and this time dodged and ripped a kick. His dexterity served him well; he landed his shin right on the spot of red. He didn't put in that much force—about as much as he could have thrown at Level 15 or so.\par
He heard a wet squelch. The boar's eyes bulged. It went careening head over heels like a derailed train, coming to a sordid, huffing halt. It tried to wobble up, then hacked up a gout of blood.\par
That was neat.\par
It came at him again, and he did the same maneuver: stepped out and punted it in the same spot. This time when it went down, it lay there writhing. So he stepped up to it and finished it.\par
Yes, he could see this skill coming in very useful. He licked his lips subconsciously. On to the next one: Chain Cyclone. He pulled up the description—\par
\par
Chain Cyclone (Active) [Rare]Executes a swift, 360-degree sweeping attack, a cyclone effect. This skill is adept at dealing with surrounding enemies, offering both offensive reach and a defensive barrier.\par
\par
Pretty self-explanatory, but he could still do with a demonstration. So he forged on deeper into the Highlands. He was searching out Treasure Areas, yellow dots clumped with Monsters. It didn't take him long to find one. He saw them from a ways off—a whole herd of Crystalback Boars circling a massive shelf of crystals, guarding it. The crystals weren't normal; they steamed with essence. If Zane got his hands on them, he had a feeling they'd give a similar effect to Moon Fruits. But these seemed even more essence-rich.\par
The Boars saw him coming, but they didn't charge at him, not at first. They just got more agitated, pawing at the ground, snorting and snarling and frothing at their tusked mouths. When he got within a thirty feet, the first of them broke from the pack and came snarling. The rest poured after it. Some were small, just Level 7, but the huge ones were nearly thrice as big—he saw one Level 19, one Level 20, even.\par
He let the ones in the front get a few good pokes in, just so the stragglers had a chance to get close. Then he unleashed the skill.\par
His Chains leapt to his hands, and he spun. The Chains twisted over each other, over and over again, a swirling double helix, and where they passed they flattened boars the way a tornado flattens a farmhouse, tears it apart, brutalizes it, leaves chunks strewn all over the ground. They spun so fast, so fiercely, they made their own wind funnel. Zane saw boars thrown ten, twenty feet into the air. There was a joke here about pigs flying, he was sure.\par
Normally it would have taken ages to squish all these things. It would be incredibly annoying in a boss fight, especially when he had no time to spare for it. But if he had this when he fought the Hobgoblin Chief, it would have lasted a tenth as long. Hardly thirty seconds later, the field was cleared of swine. The Chains dropped, and the last few loops of wind rumbled into the sky.\par
Which left him free to collect those crystals.\par
It turned out that while apples had to be eaten, absorbing from these crystals was as simple as putting your hand on them and willing the essence in. He was certain they were at least as strong as the Moon Fruit, but out of eight giant crystals and a herd of Boars, he barely managed to scrounge a level. That was the nature of the curve, he guessed. Tough. Still, he was pretty satisfied with the whole thing.\par
He looped around the place, flattening straggler Boars when he came across them, but in the next few hours, he didn't find anything nearing a boss lair. There were two more crystal deposits, whose Monster guards he trivially crushed, and whose essence he absorbed. No giant red dot, though. He was starting to think he was in the wrong section of the map entirely. Brad's tribe had gone the other way, south, while he was scouring up north.\par
So he started to loop back around. On the way, he came across a totally unguarded yellow dot. This one turned out to be a chest. A literal treasure chest, sunk a foot into the soil. When he opened it up, he found a light gray T-shirt and beige cargo pants—each grade F. Their description said they expanded and shrank to fit, and they were tear and stain resistant. His old clothes were shredded so badly he was practically naked, so these were a welcome get.\par
All he had left to test was the passive skill, Savage Body.\par
\par
Savage Body (Passive) [Signature]Activates once the Sage's health drops below 50\%. Instantaneously increases Strength, Speed, and Vitality by 25\%. When health drops to critical levels, this effect rises to 50\%.\par
\par
He needed to get down to 50\% or below. He could just let grunt Boars poke at him for half an hour, but he had a hunch it’d be a lot more fun to see just how dangerous this Crystalback Behemoth was.\par
Now. Where was that thing hiding?\par
\par


\section{9. Crystalback Behemoth (I) }
\par
Zane finished his search up north, so it was time to go south. Soon, he hit upon the route the others had gone, broadly. He saw it in dim pockets of essence crystal—already taken. He saw it in open, empty chests; the treasure had been claimed. They were heading south in a fairly straight line. Just how far down had they gone?\par
The plains were oddly quiet. It was early noon; the sun glared bright overhead. Hmm. He was in the dungeon, but he still saw the sun—this place was in the real world. If he had wings, could he just… fly out?\par
Something told him it wasn't so simple.\par
As he wound his way South, he came across a smattering of boars. None were strong enough to give him a real fight, but he still smashed the ones that bothered him. After half a dozen or so, he was rewarded with a notification:\par
\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 29 -> 30\par
Health Effect: Health Fully Restored\par
\par
Class Skill Learned:\par
Sacred Bind I (Active) [Rare]\par
Once a chain has fully wrapped the enemy, you can inflict the paralysis health effect. Effect scales with your level. Effect scales with level difference between you and your enemy. \par
\par
For shits and giggles, he tried it out on a Level 14 Boar. When he wrapped it and applied the skill, it was like it was trapped in amber—it froze still. Only its eyeballs could move. As he went, he held it aloft with his chain; an hour later, it was nowhere near unfreezing. He could feel his essence and the effect. To clear it, the boar's essence had to whittle his essence down first. At this rate, it'd be hours.\par
Now this was less than half his level. The skill as it was likely wouldn’t trouble something like the Hobgoblin Chieftain very long. But as he leveled it, who knew what it could do?\par
He’d been a wrestler. He’d liked the visceral violence of grabbing hold of someone and slamming them, and crushing them, and mauling them—like a shark dragging its prey into deep waters, never letting go of the bite. He liked that these chains might let him do the same. One day.\par
\par
*** \par
\par
"Boss...?" said Ralph hesitantly.\par
Brad whirled on him so fast the big man nearly fell over. "What do you want?"\par
"It's, uh, Mara. I think… I think she's about to keel over, boss.”\par
A vein bulged on Brad's temple.\par
"You think I care?" Brad hissed. "Every second we waste, Brick Walker gets a little closer to finding that boss before us! Don’t you get it?!”\par
Ralph shrank, nodding fast, and Brad sighed.\par
How did it come to this? Life had been going so well. After years of hard work putting in countless 40-hour weeks, he'd finally gotten promoted to VP at his dad's consulting company. He was the youngest VP in the company's history, and he would have gotten there earlier, too, if his jackass boss Roger hadn't said no at first. But good ol’ Dad took care of that. “Some people can't spot High-Value Men when they're standing right in front of ‘em,” Dad had chortled over beers.\par
Then it all went to shit. Three days later, the world turned upside down. Now Brad was stuck here with these Low-Value People in a Godforsaken forest. And he didn't even have coke to take the edge off.\par
Somehow the nightmare had gotten even worse. Brick Walker, little Brick Walker from high school, had gone from a small, stuttering, awkward weirdo to a huge, menacing, awkward weirdo. He had the balls to threaten Brad in front of his whole fucking tribe!\par
And Brad had just... let him. That was the part Brad hated most, the part he kept replaying. He should have done something. He should have put his hands on that smug fuck. Too late now; the damage was done. \par
He swore to God everyone was disrespecting him now. First, it was Nick questioning his plans—“Maybe we should cut through the valley, maybe it'll be faster.” Or Ralph saying maybe they should spend more time gathering wood; “Boss—are you sure there’s enough for the campfires?” Brad had had enough by then. He’d exploded—“Yeah, okay, okay, you think I didn't think of that? Is that it? You think I'm a fucking moron, is that it?”\par
And he’d just gone and done it again. Brad watched Ralph go, seething. He felt kind of bad about it, actually. Jess—his on-again off-again girlfriend—was always on him about his temper. It was most of the reason behind the ‘off-again.’ He'd done pretty well keeping himself in check, too, he thought. But man, these last few days... they were getting to him. \par
He took a deep breath. He’d bought a book—well, Jess had bought him a book and left it on his nightstand—something by some hippie old Asian dude, maybe the Dalai Lama? He’d skimmed a few chapters; it said visualization was supposed to help. Sounded pretty woo-woo to him, but when he’d tried it in the past it kind of worked, surprisingly. He tried it now. Yeah… he was visualizing his anger like a hot ball of twine in his chest, a hot ball unspooling… he breathed deep, in, out, in… he was starting to feel it, this sense of Zen calm trickling over him… The narrative has been illicitly obtained; should you discover it on Amazon, report the violation.\par
He opened his eyes. Ralph was coming back, looking sheepish. "Uh, Boss?" he mumbled. “Don’t mean to question you or nothing, it's just, Mara's asking if we can maybe take a break.” \par
Brad stared at him. “Say that again.” \par
“…Uh,” said Ralph. “It’s just—Mara—” \par
“A civilian,” he breathed. He almost couldn’t believe what he was hearing. \par
Even a fucking civilian was questioning him now?! \par
He marched straight over to the civilians, way out at the back of the party. "Which one of you fuckers is Mara?!” \par
They all flinched at the sight of him. For a moment, no one seemed to want to admit it. Then, a little ratty-haired old lady raised a trembling hand. Her whole body was hunched over a walking stick, like an upside-down L. That's right, she was an English teacher, or something. Brad remembered. Middle school English teacher. He always hated English. He stomped right up to her, right in her face.\par
"Ralph here tells me you think my plan’s shit. You think you want to make your own plan, you want to take a break. You think you should be chief, you should decide things. That it?" he snarled. "You have something to say to me, huh? You have something that you want to say to my face?!”\par
The old lady swallowed, trembling. She looked like she might really do it. Then she took in the expression on his face and shook her head. "Yeah," he said. "Yeah, that's what I thought. KEEP MARCHING!”\par
\par
*** \par
\par
Not ten minutes later, Brad was vindicated.\par
They found the boss lair! The ground sloped down into this huge, craggy valley, and at its bottom was the mouth of a cave. A giant red dot lay just a few hundred yards in.\par
He was so relieved he started laughing. Then the dot started to move. Out toward the entrance—toward them. "Alright, boys," Brad said. He put up a fist.\par
His lieutenants looked at him, baffled. "You fucking morons," he said, "we said the fist means 'get ready', remember? The fist means 'ready'!"\par
They scrambled, pulling out the little nuggets they'd scrounged from chests—F-grade bows, a few shitty daggers. “So. Lieutenants, go left. Warriors, go right. Scouts with me down the middle. Let's ambush this son of a—”\par
The beast left the cave, and Brad's words died in his throat.\par
\par
Crystalback Behemoth (Monster)\par
Essence Level 38\par
\par
It was like a rhinoceros on steroids, huge, almost unbelievably muscular. Its skin was rugged dark hide, studded with gleaming boulders of blue and purple crystal. A line of spear-like crystals ran down its back. It had tusks big as an elephant's and deep-set glowing red eyes, eyes the color of dying coals. And when they turned to look at Brad, he felt all muscle control leave his body. Something warm trickled down his leg. He shrieked.\par
Then he ran. They all did.\par
He'd run for nearly a minute until he was shit out of breath, until he realized the thing wasn't chasing them. It took nearly five more minutes for the rest of the group to catch up. Brad was still hyperventilating. \par
"Okay,” he gasped, "Okay, calm down, everyone, calm the FUCK DOWN, holy FUCK!" He ran a hand through his sweat-matted hair.\par
The stragglers said apparently the boss only poked its head outside. It was probably coming out for air; it went back in pretty quick.\par
Yeah, fuck that. Brick could have that monster. The two were made for each other. It took about half an hour for Brad to calm down. When he did, he made a new plan. As luck would have it, Brad had fled pretty close to an essence deposit. They went up to it as a group. This one was much more manageable; a few Boars roaming around, none over Level 15. \par
And those essence crystals were pretty damn big, too. If they followed the usual plan—that was, send in the scouts as cannon fodder, then swoop in once the monsters were busy, they could clear this. It would be rough, and maybe a scout or two would go down, but they could do this.\par
He was in the middle of relaying his plan to his underlings, trying not to think about what had just happened, when they saw a white dot with a golden 'S' on it drawing near.\par
Brad leapt up from behind his rock cluster hideout, trembling.\par
Brick Walker was strolling toward the treasures—Brad's treasures.\par
This motherfucker! \par
A man could only take so much. He felt hands grabbing at him, trying to pull him back, but he shrugged them off. Then he made a beeline straight for Brick. He felt anger bubbling up in his chest; he was so mad he felt like he might explode.\par
He didn't even have time to shout. Brick pulled out these huge black chains out of nowhere. The boars all rushed him at once.\par
Then he spun, and the chains spun, and Brad was knocked screaming off his feet.\par
When he got up again, the Boars were gone. Annihilated. Like that.\par
A freak of nature stood at the essence stones, casually absorbing them.\par
Then the freak looked at Brad—just looked at him—and his heart leapt to his throat. He choked. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out but a low whine.\par
He felt in that moment exactly the same as he had when the Behemoth looked at him. Like he was a gnat, easily crushed, like he was nothing. He felt this pressure down to the bones, down to the soul. This aura… this power…\par
\par
Zane Walker (Creature) \par
Essence Level 31\par
\par
"Yes?" said the freak.\par
Brad swallowed. Then he laughed nervously. "Oh, just, y'know, we were just about to take that. The essence stones, I mean. We have this whole, uh, plan—but you're good, man, you're good! You have it—all yours!”\par
He was sweating. What was wrong with him?\par
“Oh.” The freak turned back to the crystals.\par
All Brad could do was stand there, burning with humiliation. Humiliation and despair. He hadn't understood how weak he really was. There was nothing he could do. There was nothing any of them could do. All they could do was watch and grovel as this freak of nature took everything from him—\par
Then a great idea struck him, and slowly he began to smile. “Hey,” he said. “We found the Boss lair, by the way.”\par
“You have?”\par
Now he got the freak's attention.\par
"Yeah, it's in this cave," said Brad. "Deep in there. It’s Level 24—you think you can take it?"\par
His idea was more complicated than just leading the freak to believe the thing was much weaker than it actually was.\par
“Show me,” said the freak. \par
“Sure thing!” \par
A plan was taking shape in his mind. His smile widened. After that thing took the freak out, it'd be badly weakened, right? Then Brad could swoop in and finish it off—and reap all the rewards. He was getting giddy just thinking about all the Levels he'd get.\par
And on the off chance that freak happened to win, well…\par
Brad saw no reason he couldn’t do the same.\par
\par


\section{10. Crystalback Behemoth (II) }
\par
"This way," said Brad, with all the cheer he could muster. He didn't like turning his back to this freak; it felt like turning his back on a lion. Any moment it would pounce, he was sure. He could nearly feel the freak's dead eyes boring into his back. His shoulder-blades tingled. All Brad could do was put one foot in front of another and force his spine straight. He was sweating through his shirt, sweating down his legs, sweating so bad it was getting in his eyes. He swore they passed the same crooked tree three times—just how far was that damned lair?\par
It was a relief when it popped up on his mini map. Still there—the dot was there too, deep in, unmoving.\par
"Well," he said, "there it is!” He gestured at the cave.\par
The freak blinked. "Huh.” He seemed surprised.\par
"Yup,” said Brad, "you want us to hang around, just in case?"\par
"No need."\par
Brad kept his face blank, even as he sneered internally. The arrogant fuck. We'll see who's condescending to who soon enough.\par
"Oh, it's no trouble," Brad said easily. "We can just stay outside the entrance. So we can come in if anything goes wrong, y’know."\par
The freak shrugged as though saying, 'suit yourself'.\par
"You never know," Brad continued. "You're pretty strong, sure, but it's strong too. It's Level 24."\par
"Yes," said the freak slowly, "you told me that already.”\par
"Oh, did I?" Brad tried to play it off casually—had he overdone it? But the freak's face was as blank as ever. The others behind him glanced nervously at each other; they all knew it wasn't Level 24. They'd seen the damned thing. That moron Cale looked especially concerned. He seemed ready to speak up until Brad silenced him with a glare.\par
If anyone should have had a problem with this freak, it was Cale. If Brad saw his girl hanging off someone else's arm like that… someone was going home with a black eye—either his girl or the other guy, depending on how big the other guy was. \par
As Brad trained the glare on the rest of them, their heads went down one by one. No one dared say a word.\par
***\par
Zane peered into the mouth of the cave. There was a dot deep within, but he couldn't make it out from out here. "Hmm," he said.\par
That dark cave mouth revealed nothing, and it went on so long it was outside the scope of his mini map. Who knew what truly lay in there? Usually he liked to get his eyes on the enemy before he fought them… this time, the only thing he had was Brad's word. \par
And Brad wore a smile on his face that Zane had seen many times before. This shit-eating smile. He didn't trust that smile at all.\par
He looked back over the crowd—a little over a dozen dirty, haggard faces. "Anything else I should know?"\par
"Nope," said Brad, but he wasn't talking to Brad; he was talking to the rest of them. Silence. Then—\par
"He’s lying!" It was Annie, the little girl he'd saved. She screamed, even as her mother gave her an alarmed look. "It's Level 38!" cried Annie. "Don't go in!"\par
"Yeah," said Zane, "I suspected that."\par
He turned on Brad, who was quickly backpedaling. "No, no, no," he said, "it's not like that! She's lying, dude, it's just one Boar, it's got a few minions. She—she doesn't know what she's talking about. She's like five!” \par
"I’m nine, asshole!” shouted Annie. Her mother’s stare was turning horrified—whether at her daughter’s insolence, or at the fact she knew a swear word, Zane wasn’t sure. \par
"Looks like we have a problem here," said Zane, crossing his arms. \par
"Dude, I swear, I swear on my—" Brad shook his head. "On my mama’s ashes, man. I swear, right hand to God, it's Level 24!"\par
He looked ready to shit himself. Zane considered them, then—"Fine," he said. "You stand by that?"\par
"Of course!"\par
"Then come with me."\par
"What?"\par
"Into the cave."\par
In the silence that followed, you could hear Brad swallow. He choked out a laugh. "You're joking."\par
“It’s Level 24," said Zane, "according to you. I'm Level 31. Stay behind me, and you'll be in no danger. Put your money where your mouth is."\par
"Uhh—"\par
Zane took a step toward him, and Brad stumbled back.\par
"Get him!" he shrieked.\par
Brad's men charged. A few burly grunts and wild-eyed boys came howling, and Zane, he watched them come in genuine boredom. He didn't even need to draw his chains; he just walked forward leisurely and grazed their chins. They fell, one by one, eyes rolling back. Brad kept scrambling, screaming, "Stay away from me! You—"If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
Then he saw the people he called ‘civilians.’ And Zane saw the awful idea come into his head.\par
Brad leapt, reaching for a hostage. But Zane was quicker. He ripped into Brad's stomach, dug his knuckles so deep he nearly touched the spine, felt the wind crushed out of the man. Then Brad fell, curling over himself in the fetal position, whimpering, sobbing a little.\par
Only now did Zane bring out his chains. A few Sacred Binds later, they were all frozen solid.\par
"That should hold them," he said. He looked to the rest of the group. It was blatantly obvious none of them had any love for their self-appointed leader. "Anyone have something you can bind them with? Just in case."\par
As it turned out, they did. They'd picked up some cords of Grade F grappling rope from a treasure chest; it was built to withstand a rockslide. With this double lock in place, Zane was pretty certain they weren’t getting out anytime soon.\par
"I'll be trying the boss lair soon," Zane said. "Can you people keep track of them?"\par
They frantically nodded. Most of them fell to their knees; a few started sobbing. From them, he gathered that Brad and his posse had set a brutal pace for days. Most of them couldn't keep up, especially the children and the elderly. But they were all too scared to speak out. They babbled their thanks at him; they insisted on introducing themselves to him, and he could only awkwardly listen and nod.\par
There was Mara, a frizzy-haired, scattered-brained middle school chem teacher from a town a few miles north. She seemed a sweet old lady. Now she wasn't so scared, Zane could imagine her as the kind of teacher who kept a cookie jar on her desk, or who went out of her way to check on a student if they seemed down. The first thing she asked was if he'd seen her grandkids. She'd collapsed a little when he said no. She'd been with them when integration happened, and they got separated, and… well. Zane could guess what’d happened to them.\par
Then came Elena, a former D2 pole vaulter who happens to go to the same college Zane did. At level 15, she was the best fighter of the bunch, after Jacob and his goons. She was quiet, but she had a determined, almost angry set to her jaw. “You can count on me, sir. I won't let them run,” she promised. Sir? Zane honestly didn't care that much. It wasn't like they could hurt him anyway; the ropes were more for the others’ sake. But he appreciated the sentiment.\par
There was Liam, lanky blond a pre-Med at UDub, who had been out on a camping trip. He seemed very out of sorts, a little desperate. He kept saying he had to get out of here—he had an orgo final next Tuesday. He couldn't be stuck here. He kept repeating it like a mantra. Zane would be surprised if UDub still existed. The boy seemed a little disconnected from reality.\par
He wasn't the only one. There were a handful of high schoolers who stumbled around in vacant shock. There was Annie, who Zane thanked for speaking up, and Annie's mother, who was a software engineer at a big tech firm. She'd been with Raj—a software engineer from the same firm—on their quarterly ‘innovation synergy excursion,’ which was big tech for corporate retreat, when integration hit. They, at least, seemed adjusted, if a little frazzled. They'd accepted reality; they seemed ready to grit through.\par
Then there were Cale and Sophie. Sophie still wouldn't look at him. Cale said she felt scorned, but Cale said thanks for the both of them. Zane had always thought he was a good dude, maybe a little too good. Sophie was on to something when she said he had golden retriever energy; very ‘ah shucks’ kind of guy. If Zane punched him in the face right now, he'd probably go, "Come on, man, where do you have to do that for?"\par
They seemed a decent bunch. The trouble was they kept looking at him expectantly. Like they expected him to lead them. He sighed.\par
"Honestly," he said, "I don't want to lead you people. I don't even really care about getting out of here. I just want to fight.” \par
They stared at him like he was speaking an alien language.\par
"But I realize," he continued, "shitty as they were to you—these," he nodded at Brad and his bunch, "might have been the only people keeping you from the monsters. And I've just deprived you of them. So. You can tag along with me for now. Just keep out of my way, and I'll clear the monsters. Sound good?"\par
Nods all around.\par
"You can select a new leader amongst yourselves," he said, waving absently. It was quickly decided Cale would be the new leader. Zane suspected because he seemed the opposite of Brad.\par
"Alright," he said. "Then stay in the area. You can move around if you see Monsters coming, let's stay close. I’ll be back in a few hours."\par
He might’ve gone in without prep if it truly was Level 24. But 37… some precautions were in order.\par
*** \par
In those few hours, he went back and scoured the Goblin’s territory for Moon Fruit—he was pretty sure he picked every last one. Then he swept the Crystalback Highlands too, sucking up all the essence he could, slaying every Monster he came across. He left a few crystal clusters untouched for practical reasons. \par
All that effort yielded him only two levels and change. Still, it could make a difference. \par
The Fruit he’d retrieved definitely would. \par
*** \par
He came back and found that the Sacred Binds still had most of their energy left. He’d prepped all he could. \par
For a moment, he thought a few of them might volunteer to go with him—Cale and Elena seemed on the verge of it—but ultimately, they hung their heads and nodded.\par
Zane understood how they were feeling, even if he couldn't really sympathize. All this must be a lot to put on someone. At times, he figured a typical person might be overwhelmed.\par
Zane had the opposite problem: he was constantly underwhelmed. He didn't feel shit. So this place was a kind of paradise. The only times he'd felt the way this place made him feel were one— when he was fighting. And two—one afternoon three years ago, when he'd accidentally taken some mystery pills along with his usual antidepressants, and experienced, for a euphoric ten minutes, what he imagined most people must feel all the time. He wept at a ray of sunlight. It was awesome. Try as he might with whatever drugs he could get his hands on, he could never recreate it. \par
"Are you sure you'll be okay?” said Cale.\par
Zane shrugged. “I’m Level 32 now. It's Level 37. Close enough. Should be a good fight.”\par
The answer was no—of course, he wasn’t sure he would be okay. What fun was there in that? As he looked over this disheveled clump of survivors, he could see that was what they needed—this assurance. They were so painfully scared of death. Death fucked them up so bad they had a hard time living. It was unhealthy.\par
Zane had never understood the fuss. He felt no strong way about it, one way or another—which was pretty much how he felt about everything. Death was simply nothing, all the time—it couldn’t be any worse than sleep. Certainly it had to be less soul-drudgingly boring than life. If he went out swinging, burning hot, he'd count it as a win.\par
Cale looked doubtful. “Take care, man.”\par
“You can do it!” squeaked Annie. Zane decided she was his favorite of the bunch.\par
Off he went.\par
*** \par
He was more than 90\% of the way through his Level. He could feel the warmth of it tingling on his skin. He had a Moon Fruit in his mouth; same trick. This trick would be harder and harder to pull off the higher Level he got—just too rare to be this close to a Level Up. He’d milk it while he could. \par
Soon, halfway down the length of the cave, the full extent of it came into his mini-map. There was a chamber far out. No minions this time. At the center, huge red dot. It didn't seem so different from the Hobgoblin Chief's lair, at least from a bird's eye view. Only underground.\par
He got a notification.\par
\par
Lair Lock: Chamber of the Behemoth\par
The Crystalback Behemoth has locked its boss lair.\par
\par
He breathed out. So it had sensed him too. No turning back now.\par
\par


\section{11. Crystalback Behemoth (III) }
\par
Zane picked through the gloom. The path was surprisingly smooth, and the cave was studded with glowing crystals lighting a dim path. Even from way out here, he could hear the thing's breathing, a groaning, rattling sound utterly filling the space of the tunnel, crowding out the sounds of his footsteps, his breathing, his heartbeat.\par
Then he made a turn, and the chamber opened up before him. He saw the Boar at the other end, its dim coal-like red eyes narrowed at him. The thing was massive, hulking, and covered in a tortoise shell of giant crystals. Its tusks stood out to him most—like those old Japanese curved swords. If one caught him in the belly, he imagined it'd go right through him.\par
No minions though. Apparently the boss was challenge enough.\par
It let him take his place in the chamber, just watching, snorting crystal plumes. The chamber was narrow as though it were built for jousting.\par

Gemstone Rampage (Active) [Uncommon]\par
When its health falls below a certain threshold, the Behemoth's crystals glow intensely, entering an enraged state. In this mode, its attacks become more aggressive, and it occasionally shakes off crystal shards that scatter and damage those in a radius.\par
\par
Its belly lit up red in Zane's eyes—its weak point, a circle right in the middle of it. That was where he would try to land—where he'd put a Titan's fist if he could.\par
Still it stood there, snorting at him. What was it waiting for? Shrugging, Zane went first.\par
His Chains dropped in air. Instantly, he twirled them, and threw up Chain Cyclone. \par
Then he dashed straight at the boar, chains swirling.\par
Only when he got within ten paces did the thing charge him.\par
It took a step, then another, and each shattered the ground, rippled it as though it were water, not stone. But Zane had seen that Skill. He leaped right over the fiercest of the waves. Man and Boar collided.\par
And Zane was tossed nearly halfway across the room; his Cyclone sputtered out. The moment it met the boar's Quake Charge, it was like a bubble popping; it lost all integrity, was rent apart. Then Zane was at the mercy of the charging Boar.\par
It was all he could do to throw his Chains as hard as he could at the thing—then dive the other way, like a matador. The Boar went barreling past, shedding crystal dust like snowflakes; the ground shattered in its wake, spitting clouds of dust.\par
Zane sucked in a breath. That thing was strong as hell! He’d just put himself against it—his chains were an extension of his limbs, an extension of his strength, and it had just blasted him easily. \par
He considered its build as it wheeled back around. It must be a little like him, but even more extreme: huge strength, huge vitality, but it ponderously slow. Its turning reminded Zane of a cruise ship slowly wheeling around a port. \par
Didn't matter. Not in this cramped space. It charged him again, and he barely scrambled out of the way; he tried throwing his chains at it, but the full force of them could barely throw the beast off one hoof. The problem wasn’t wasn’t his Chains. His Chains were heavy as hell, but that thing wore a mountain range on its back.\par
If he couldn’t get it off its feet, how was he meant to get at its belly?\par
He saw why it had let him get close now. It was so slow that was the only way it could hope to hit him. But he was so weak he couldn't scratch it either. Couldn't even move it—you just needed a little more…\par
Hmm.\par
This was probably a bad idea. But just the thought of it made his blood run hot. \par
The next time it charged, he charged too. And this time, when it rammed at him, he punched right back—right up its nose.\par
Predictably, this did nothing.\par
Predictably, it gored him clean in the midsection. He was right—its horns did cut straight through him with a wet squelch. He made a kebab of himself. That had at least three organs going through. The pain was blinding. Its vibrations shivered through him; his bones felt strangely brittle; his teeth chattered intensely. He was so close he could stare it straight in its fist-sized eyes, feel the billowing heat of its breath pouring over him, fluttering his hair, shrieking by his ears. \par
\par
Warning! Health under 75\%.\par
\par
Well under 75\%, he imagined—If you come across this story on Amazon, it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\par
Then his back struck the wall hard.\par
\par
Warning! Health under 50\%.\par
\par
And then—\par
\par
Savage Body activated!\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
\par
Exactly what he’d been waiting for. \par
It pulled back, rammed him again, and he shoved himself right off, blood trickling from his grinning lips. Now, let's try again. He lashed it with a chain, and this time he got it off two feet—just enough for him to whip the other chain under—\par
The Boar roared and blocked it with its tusks.\par
It wasn't enough? Are you kidding? \par
Don't tell me I’ll have to… Zane sighed. Oh, well! He was in this deep already. Might as well go all the way!\par
It was coming at him with another Quake Charge, but he probably couldn't take another head-on and live. He'd have to soften it some.\par
He rushed the beast again. This time, as it charged, he ripped at its legs with a Chain, trying to trip it; it leapt right over. He caught its hind legs with the other Chain—again, he could barely make it stumble. But he’d thrown off its aim; it bulldozed into him.\par
Warning! Health under 25\%!\par
He was flung spinning away; he landed in a coughing, bloody mess. His health was almost, but not quite there… What if he could just—\par
He dug a hand into his open insides, grabbed something squishy, and flung it out. It kind of looked like a sausage—small intestine, maybe? Whatever it was, a lot of blood came out after it.\par
\par
Warning! Critical health\par
\par
There we go.\par
\par
Savage Body activated!\par
Strength increased 50\%\par
Speed increased 50\%\par
Vitality increased 50\%\par
\par
Now for the finale, hopefully. This time, when it came at him, he had both chains at the ready. It got within ten meters, eight, five, three—\par
He swept both chains straight up with all the force he could muster.\par
It was like an on-ramp for its momentum. This time, the big bastard was thrown up, squealing, and at last, Zane got a look at that soft underbelly.\par
And all his essence gathered in his fist.\par
Gotcha.\par
Titan's Fist!\par
He lunged into it with the coordination of a drunkard, but the hit was clean. Beautiful, even. Right at the weakest point. The boar went tumbling, rolling awkwardly over itself, wedged to a halt by its own rocky back.\par
\par
Skill up!\par
Titan’s Fist I -> II\par
\par
…Did that mean it was dead? \par
A heartbeat passed.\par
Then, groaning, it stumbled to its feet. That thing did not look dead. Not even close to dead. It did look very, very angry.\par
Just how ungodly high was its vitality?!\par
It charged again, and he barely had the wherewithal to swallow his Moon Fruit.\par
\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 32 -> 33\par
\par
Not a moment too soon. This time, he lunged a hair too late. The tusk ripped clean through his side.\par
\par
Warning! Health under 75\%!\par
\par
Shit.\par
As it wheeled, he ran to the other side of the chamber, put some distance between them, and tried to think, hunched a little, clutching at the gaping bloody hole in him. \par
So after all that, nothing had changed. They were still in a weird stalemate. It was too slow; he was too weak. Only now, he'd burned his trump card on a stupid idea.\par
It was stupid, wasn't it? He was too focused on what his skill told him—on its weak points. It might be weakest there, but its weak point was also its most protected. And he was going at it striking—but in a space this cramped, his Chains could hardly build any momentum. \par
…They were Chains. Why was he using them like whips? Why was he trying to beat his way through stone? \par
He took in the Boar again—really looked. With his eyes, not his Skill. And he saw a beast with impenetrable skin, skin clustered with crystal chunks like plates of armor. \par
But armor had chinks. \par
Not small enough for a fist to slip through, maybe. Not small enough to target with a whip’s lash. Too small to strike at…\par
It roared at him again, rocking the earth, sending gravel popping off the ground. It seemed a challenge, like it was saying, ‘I can go all day. Can you?’\par
Then it burst at him again. But this time, Zane leapt. He didn't whip at it or punch at it. Instead, he slid his Chains over it almost gently as it passed underneath, slid until he found the place where the plates on its body met the plates on its head—that little chink in the armor. \par
A chink you could fit a noose through.\par
 He yanked it tight. It stuck.\par
Then a monstrous force jerked him forward; jerked him through the Chain. He went flying, struck a wall so hard he nearly blacked out; he blinked black craters out of his vision, but he held on. As the Boar turned, he yanked—he flew at it and crash-landed painfully on its back. It reared, trying to get him off, but it couldn't, and there he looped another Chain around its neck, and grinned bloodily.\par
Then he pulled with all his might.\par
He felt that huge body jerk under him, tense up in a sudden panic. It thrashed, it bucked, but it couldn't get out; the Chains were locked in tight, strangling it. \par
It went buck mad. It charged straight out of the wall, smashed its head against it, threw itself at the ground, at the ceiling, and it hurt like a motherfucker; huge gashes rose up on his arms, his legs. A spearlike crystal took a chunk out of his belly. But Zane kept his grip through it all.\par
He rattled in a hacking breath. He tried throwing a Soul Bind at it, but the Skill lasted all of a half-second. It was back to thrashing.\par
Then the crystals on the boy's back started to glow.\par
Zane blinked, then the thought flooded back to him, that skill—\par
\par

When its health falls below a certain threshold, the Behemoth's crystals glow intensely, entering an enraged state. In this mode, its attacks become more aggressive, and it occasionally shakes off crystal shards that scatter and damage those in a radius.\par
\par
He wheezed out a laugh. This is about to get interesting!\par
And the boar bucked him harder than it ever had, so hard Zane was shocked his arms hadn't been torn clean off. He'd barely fallen back when the crystals surged, shocking yellow, and exploded.\par
One by one, it felt like he was stuck in a hailstorm, only instead of hail what struck him was scalding hot. \par
Don't let go. He told himself, gritting his teeth. A simple, stupid, brutally effective strategy—don't you fucking dare!\par
Then—\par
\par
Warning: Health under 50\%.\par
\par
And new power surged into his limbs. He wrenched hard, laughing, feeling hundreds of rivers of blood gushing off of him.\par
The boar bucked one last time.\par
Then it shuddered, and was still.\par
\par

Crystalback Behemoth has been slain! \par

\par
That was fun.\par
He was still grinning as he got the notification.\par
\par
Skill Learned! \par
Promethean Noose I (Active) [Rare]\par
Promethean Noose, a skill exclusive to the Prometheus Chains, summons the relentless fury of the Titan's curse. The chains burn with ethereal flame, ensnaring foes in a grip that tightens with their struggles. Scalds and strangles at once. Heat and force scale with level.\par
\par
Lovely.\par
His first thought was, this sure would’ve been useful before the fight. His second was—no, he had it backwards. The timing was too convenient—he must’ve gotten it because of the fight. Apparently, skills could be earned.\par
...if he'd never thought to strangle something, would he never have learned that skill? Would it have popped up anyway eventually via level up? He frowned. He had so many little questions like these. A tutorial would have come in handy.\par
Then again it didn't seem the System’s style. It was more of a ‘drop you into deep waters and see if you can swim’ kind of teacher. The only principle it seemed to operate by was natural selection.\par
\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 33 -> 34\par

\par
Nice. Well however the system worked, it worked, which was what mattered to him. The rest he didn't care so much about. He stuffed his free point into Strength. \par
Then he turned to the mouth of the cave, and jerked back. But it was only light--and lots of it. A whole region's worth of Boar essence rushed at him at once, soaking into him. He’d almost forgot, kill the boss and you get the minions too.\par
It wasn't enough for a level, though. He was only three-quarters of the way there. All the Boars on this plane, and not one level, huh. Damn. Really did get a lot tougher the higher you went.\par
He left the cave in a cheery mood, still basking in the warm afterglow of the fight. \par
As he walked up the valley, he found the survivors staring at him horrified. All except for Annie, who waved at him. He waved back.\par
"See,” Annie told her mother. “I told you!"\par
As Zane neared, he took a glance down and realized why everyone looked so off-put. His shirt was bloody. He was baffled why the blood was still there—why hadn't it dissolved into essence. Then he realized it was his own blood.\par
"I'm fine," he said. Still, they stared at him, none of them seemed to trust themselves to speak.\par
A hoarse voice from the back broke the silence. "Fuck you!"\par
It was Brad. Zane sensed most of his bind had dissolved—it still kept them immobilized, but only from the torso down. His mouth was free to yap. Apparently, three hours sitting here stewing had given him confidence.\par
"Just you wait," he growled. Then came closer. "Yeah you! Brick, I'm talking to you! Brick Walker! Yeah, you little shit, that's right. You listen here.”\par
Zane took a step, and he saw a flash of uncertainty in Brad's eyes. Still, he put up a brave face. "Untie me this instant!" He seemed like one of those Chihuahuas who barked extra loud to cover for their small stature. It was hard to fathom there was a time Zane had been scared of this sad creature. "I swear—"\par
Zane slapped him. Teeth went flying. A spurt of blood followed the teeth.\par
Then Brad collapsed, whimpering. It was like Zane had slapped all the fight out of him too. Zane found he far preferred conflict resolution in this world. So simple. Zane knelt, gave him a moment to let the force of the slap soak in. Then—\par
"Don't call me Brick," he said blandly.\par
Sniveling, Brad nodded.\par
He cast under the sole bind on Brad and his grunts, just to make sure they were shut up.\par
Then, hands clasped behind his back, he turned to address the group. Faces young and old stared up at him, a little weary, a little wary, a little hopeful.\par
"So," he said, “Everyone. I said I'm not interested in leading you. This is still true. But this region is now clear of monsters, so. Stay here, rest, do whatever you want. I’ll be back soon enough.” \par
"And what will you do?" someone said softly. It was Sophie. He blinked; he was surprised she was talking to him now, though she was looking down at her hands. She couldn't seem to meet his eyes.If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
"Clear the area, I guess," he said, shrugging. "Then the dungeon should be over. If that box was telling the truth."\par
They all perked up at that. Surprisingly he felt a pang of sadness. He would miss this place when it was gone.\par
Then he remembered the message did say there were, what—\par
\par
Dungeons Generated: 114,183 \par
\par
…\par
And this was only one of them. And on the grade F. Which implied an E, a D, a C… right?\par
Like that, he was eager again. New boss time. Then… who knew? \par
After two bosses, and all the new powers he'd learned, he figured he was pretty damn strong. Unless this next boss—keeper of the Groves—was on a different tier entirely, he doubted it'd be too much of a challenge. He was already thinking ahead, of the outside.\par
"Stay safe," said Sophie softly, turning away. "We're counting on you." He wasn't sure what her deal was.\par
"Yeah!" said Cale by her side. "We're rooting for you, man." He made to link his arm with Sophie's, but Sophie shook him off. He looked sheepish.\par
"Appreciate it," said Zane, to be polite. He didn't much care either way.\par
"Oh right—you're heading South, yeah?"\par
"Should be." That was where the Grove of Whispers was marked out on the map. The keeper's domain.\par
Cale hesitated. "You might just come across Randall."\par
"Who?"\par
"This team leader of another group. Former marine, I think he said? We were going to go together, but he had a falling out with Brad and, umm, we split off. They went south for the Grove, we came here."\par
How bad did Randall have to be for them to pick Brad over him?\par
"He's… not a nice dude," said Cale, wincing.\par
How bad did Randall have to be for Cale to badmouth him?\par
"…Noted," said Zane. "I'll be careful."\par
He gave them all a wave before he set off. They were still staring at him, each one of them. Somehow, he had a feeling they kept staring until he passed out of sight.\par
By then the sun was setting, shading the darkening plains rust-orange. The farther south he went, the less rugged the land got—but no grass replaced it, just bare dirt. A few trees stuck out of the ground, stubby ones, leafless as though in winter. They rose straighter and taller the farther he went.\par
By the time he got to the Grove boundary, night had fully fallen. The moon washed everything pale white.\par
Where the Emerald Forest was lush and thick and glowing, the Grove of Whispers was tall and skeletal. All there was were barren trees, the branches reaching uselessly, like arms of the damned clawing for heaven. In the moonlight, they seemed made of bone, not wood. The earth was hard and cracked, infected with patches of withered grass. As he made his way in, his footsteps echoed unnaturally, like the ground itself was hollow.\par
Leafless vines snaked across the ground, up the tree trunks; they seemed to move when he wasn't looking at them. Fingers of fog splayed out against the ground, grasping at the trees, wrapping his legs in a cold moist embrace. Ancient stones lay half-buried, far too eroded to make out the letters. And over it all came the wind, pouring between the branches, shrieking like a dying animal.\par
He got the feeling it was a mistake visiting this place at night.\par
It was a visibility thing. These things didn't scare him, but all that dark, all those hiding places unsettled him. He kept searching for a place to settle down to rest, but not an inch of this land seemed hospitable.\par
Not an inch of this land was alive. There weren't people. There weren't animals. Not even treasures or monsters popped up on his mini map. It was just… empty.\par
He remembered the last time he was struck by how empty a place seemed. He started checking for shadows where they shouldn't be. The annoying thing was it was night; of course, they were everywhere.\par
He'd hardly taken 100 steps in—barely a scouting mission—but he was very close to turning back. Trying this again when the sun was up. Then something popped up on the edge of his mini map—he crept closer, into a clearing.\par
Oh, never mind. It was only a cluster of X’s. A bare clearing with nothing around. So there's that Randall, I guess.\par
And if Randall had died here…\par
His eyes slowly swept the clearing. So this place wasn't as deserted as it seemed.\par
Yep. He'd stuck a toe in, and he was pulling out. It was the smart thing to do. He'd head back, make camp, get a good night's sleep. Then tackle this again tomorrow when the sun was up. Sighing, he turned and made for the edge.\par
He'd hardly taken five steps back when the notification hit him.\par
\par
Lair lock\par
The Keeper and the Grove has locked its Boss lair\par
\par
… What.\par
He whirled around. Where? Where was the lair wall?!—\par
Slowly, he turned. And blinked.\par
The border between the Highlands and the Grove of Whispers had sprung up a pale blue.\par
The wall ran wide—so wide he couldn't see where it ended. But he suddenly knew where. It was following the lines of his mini map.\par
A cold fist gripped his heart.\par
This entire region was its lair.\par
The moment he'd set foot in here…\par
He frowned at the trees. At the branches. How had it known? It had locked it as soon as he turned—it must have been watching him. But for the life of him, he could not figure out where.\par
He felt a little sweat on his palms. Now he was getting a little spooked. And if he was a little spoooked— \par
Sudden motion. Not in his vision—in his mini map. A red dot 20 paces out from him. Then another. And another and another and another—all around him, everywhere they came, it's a horrible life. He stumbled backwards into the clearing, not sure where to look. Branches swooned, but it wasn't the wind. They were moving on their own.\par
All around him, every single tree began to bend. A huge creaking, groaning ripped across the clearing. \par
All at once, the forest was coming alive.\par
…Shit.\par
The vines slithered out like snakes, massing along the paths, clogging the exits. The trees were moving. Impossibly, they were coming closer, their branches thrashing wilder as they did. He backed up farther into the clearing—he was painfully aware he was now standing over the X's—as they swamped in around him. They loomed over him; he swore their branches were reaching for him.\par
He looked at one.\par

\section{13. The Keeper (II) }
\par
The trees crowded close. They'd be at him in seconds. He had to think. He wasn't looking at the Keeper’s body—he was looking at its puppets. Where was its weakness? He spotted it suddenly, so tiny it seemed a trick of light—this red glimmer in the distance that must be where the Keeper really was. But he had to wade his way through a wood army to get there. He breathed deep and shut out the prickling of panic. He tried to keep as many of them in his field of view as he could. His Chains whipped out—\par
He jerked; he’d had a sudden thought.\par
Then he crossed his arms, frowning. Frowning even as they barreled at him, dead branches stretched out like spears, angling to skewer him.\par
But he wasn't nervous anymore. “Am I stupid?”\par
He'd been caught up in the aesthetics of it, the looks. Haunted houses had always bored him, but this one somehow put a little worm of doubt in him. Now he saw these Monsters plotting up at him were really scarecrows. He felt silly.\par
It was because he'd forgotten to actually take stock of what was going on. And he'd just gotten that new skill. He hadn't even tested it; it was easy to slip his mind.\par
I'm in the woods. And I have a fire weapon.\par
Not even just woods. These were the most flammable kind of wood: dead trees.\par
…\par
As they rushed him he threw out his chains, high out, arching to make a broad circle.\par
Then the branches struck. He fell back into his usual detached calm; he was a little amused as he watched them skewer him—as though it were happening to someone else. It was like those magicians' boxes where they put an assistant in, then drive spears through. At the end the assistant always emerged unharmed.\par
In this case, he was disappointed but not surprised to find he was very much harmed. The branches smoldered with white essence; they went straight through him. There must have been six or seven in all. They tried to throw more but trees were big and unwieldy. They got in each other's way.\par
\par
Warning: Health under 50\%! \par
Savage Body activated!\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
\par
Right! But now they were stuck in here with him. And the noose outside connected.\par
The Chains lit up with blue fire, clear as a morning sky. And they tightened; it was like seeing a spark flicked on a pool of oil. Everywhere he saw dead wood burst into flame; there was a hissing, a crackling, a screaming. The trees thrashed all around him, struggling to get free, but the noose tightened further, the fire flaring hotter. Fire leapt gleefully from branch to branch; the crackling grew fiercer. Suddenly all he saw was fire, a field of blue fire, a lively ocean drowning the trees to nothing.\par
The trees closest to him—or maybe the Keeper controlling them—saw the problem now. The noose had clumped them too tight; they weren't breaking free; they were stuck in here with him.\par
The only way out was to kill him.\par
They turned back to him, raised their branches once more—\par
He yanked violently on the chains, and they all came rushing in. Bunched so tight there was no room to move; they tried wailing on him, but they could only clobber him with the blunt underarms of their branches; the points were too close to angle. He had drawn it so tight he was suffocating himself. But he was grinning all the same.\par
They were the ones burning. \par
The tall trees began to slump, crack off, break apart. Trunks split in half, branches dropped away; all that was left was heaps of smoldering ash, speckled with dying embers.\par
Zane stood there in the middle of it and surveyed his work, satisfied. He’d just cleared out a huge chunk—he doubled the size of the clearing.\par
More trees were lining up at the edges. Pouring in from all over the region. He wasn't getting a break, huh.\par
They rushed him again, a second wave. So it didn't matter how much the Keeper lost. It meant to keep chucking them at him until he whittled away.\par
The question was—who would outlast who? Sure, this Keeper had a lot of trees, but…\par
He swung out a Chain in a broad arc, wrapped it around the nearest tree he could snatch, made a noose. He did the same with the other Chain. Then he set both trees aflame.\par
The Chains began to spin. Could he stack Skills? The Chains spun faster and faster; ghostly blue fire raised the air—apparently so! It looked like one of those typhoons gathering over the Pacific, but the water was burning. It roared as only natural disasters could roar, and even just the embers flicking off it set the branches of trees ablaze.\par
Then, licking his lips, Zane started to run. And when he made contact with those reaching trees, they melted before him; he ripped clean through a grove, burst out the other side, turned back to find the world on fire. His torches were running out so he scooped up new trees and kept up his mad dash, spinning, vomiting gouts of fire all over. Everywhere he went, destruction followed.Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.\par
And the trees gave chase, desperately grasping. They came at him in their thousands, firmed up in thorny walls, and he tore straight through them, ripping them up at the roots. Vines snatched at his ankles but charred before they could firm a grip. He saw tree after tree after tree ignite; he felt the fire burning within him, in his heart, felt something catch fire there too. He began to run, laughing, exhilarated, and all he saw were licking tongues of flame.\par
A grove lit all at once. A line of trees lunging for him, then falling back, bursting ablaze one by one. As he ran, he stared into that fire, that flush deep blue catching on pale white bark, again and again and again…\par
Wait. What was that? \par
There! He saw it—hidden in the fires…in that seam, the instant between when wood took the flame. A crack. A crack in the surface of the world. What was he seeing? \par
A strange feeling washed over him. Something he had never felt before. He stopped, and took notice. \par
His eyes started to lose focus; the world felt somehow like cardboard, or rather made of surfaces: he was seeing what lay beneath. As he peered into those fires it was like staring into a door nudged open just a sliver; he could just barely make out the great beyond. What was going on? He felt… very good. In an incredibly odd way.\par
He saw it, staring into the fire; he saw it—a revelation. He'd been struck by this feeling before; this sense of sudden realization where everything suddenly makes sense. But this was on a scale he never felt. If that feeling was a candle, his mind torched in bonfire. \par
Suddenly he was floating; he felt outside himself, he wasn't here anymore, not really. These things, this running, this torching, it was happening distantly to someone else. He was falling beneath it all, falling through the surface of the world. He couldn't seem to tear his eyes from the fire, the way it caught; he couldn't stop himself. He saw it: the truth beneath it all.\par
He'd seen this truth before. Not only in the fire—it was in him all along. His life was like dead wood, floating in empty space, needing a spark, a fight. A fire, and he ignited. It felt absurd, and yet looking at the scene of wanton arson he saw something of himself.\par
It was hard to fathom; he didn't understand or even really accept what was happening. Not at a conscious level. It was as though he had taken a wrong turn down the labyrinth of consciousness and gazed upon the naked face of God. \par
This did not feel normal. \par
Then the feeling swept out of him, but it left something behind. An indescribably intimate knowing, a sense of perfect stillness, of harmony.\par
He froze.\par
The wood at the ends of his chains was charred to ash, the last remnants of the dead tree army circling for one last charge. But Zane was quiet, shocked to stillness.\par
He felt he had just grazed something very profound. Something that lay dormant beneath the surface of the world. But he could wake it. He didn't need wood anymore.\par
Prometheus brought fire into this world… “Let there be light," he whispered. He raised his hands.\par
And the chains roared up in fire. Not the fire of the noose—this fire was so bright it was nearly pure white, burning on the steel. It didn't need to be thus; Zane knew then he could make anything burn.\par
\par
Law Comprehended\par
Minor Law of Ignition (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
\par
It felt like he was beloved by the Universe in a way that was hard to explain. If the concept of Ignition was an object, and normal people went through life seeing it, touching it, thinking they knew it—only he knew it could be picked up. They all saw the front, but he saw both the front and the back; he saw it in its entirety, and he knew there was a handle on the other side.\par
All he had to do was reach for it.\par
Reach, and from nothing came fire.\par
He reached with his Chains, and the fire that burned there was special. He knew instinctively; he could feel it. It carried within it a Law. A Law that didn't need touch. To be in its presence was to burn.\par
He stood, panting, breathless amid a wasteland heaped high with ash. At its edges, white fire tore into the last of the wood and left nothing in its wake.\par
What was that?\par
Law… he rolled the thought around in his mind. It wasn't essence—but it seemed to amplify essence, to give it certain traits it could never have on its own. It turned his fire white. And when his chains touched soil, they left burning lines in their wake. This fire burned everything.\par
How had he done that? Gotten that? He was so immersed in the burning it was like they were one and the same. They were, briefly, intensely, one. \par
Could he do that again? \par
He shook his head, chuckling. He could leave this till later; the battle was done. Far out, across the barren, cracked earth, over the mounds of ash, stood a shadow cloaked in black.\par
Zane strode for it.\par
He couldn't see its face, even a few dozen strides out. When the moonlight met its cowl, it vanished into the dark. The only things he saw were two glowing red eyes deep within. There was no telling what it was thinking.\par
\par
Keeper of the Forest (Monster)\par
Essence Level 41\par
\par
Let's end this.\par
He dashed straight for it. It whirled back so fast you would have thought it teleported if not for the trail of shadows it left; it raised its hands, pale knobbly hands, like knots on a tree trunk.\par
A dozen keepers shimmered into existence. Then they all shuffled around him, surrounding him. Zane leapt for one, swiped at it. It vanished. He swiped at another—then a third lunged for his throat from behind, nearly firmed its hand around his neck. But he slashed a Chain at it and it too puffed to smoke.\par
Enough! His Chains lit with white and he tore out a Chain Cyclone. Flares blitzed the air. The illusions vanished shrieking; the real Keeper threw its arms over its face, and the flares sputtered out on its cloak.\par
As the Keeper blocked, Zane snaked a Chain around its leg. It tried to run, it couldn't break free. Then he snaked the other around its throat.\par
Promethean Noose!\par
It didn't panic as the chains went right around it. Instead, it calmly reached its clawed hand for him, and he felt his heart lurch in his chest, felt suddenly sleepy.\par
He felt his life draining out from him, could see it on the air, this white film pouring into the keeper—\par
Not fast enough. Grinning, he wrenched harder. He felt something give beneath the chains, like brittle wood snapping.\par
\par
Warning! Health Under 25\%\par
\par
It was starting to tremble. Zane felt eyes swelling shut, but he had the bite in deep. He had it, and he knew it.\par
\par
Warning: Critical Health\par

The notification had hardly passed when a crack louder than all the rest resounded through the grove. It came from the Keeper's neck.\par
The Monster hung limp.\par
\par
The Keeper of the Grove has been slain!\par

F-Rank Dungeon Luminous Forest cleared!\par
Converting to Safe Zone… \par

\par


\section{14. Safe Zone}
\par
The notification box stayed there for some time. He guessed it took a little while to convert this place into a Safe Zone, whatever that meant. He started to think back on the fight, on that crack in the world he’d looked through; on how abstract everything seemed all of a sudden, on the sense that something greater, immaterial, lay beneath the surface.\par
It was gone now. The ground felt solid under his feet. He saw no cracks. It felt like he’d woken from a very good dream. It felt like a eureka moment, something he couldn’t force. That insight felt fragile. He had this gut feeling it came to you when you, and it, were ready.\par
He shook his head, frowning. What? The more he listened to himself, the sillier he sounded.\par
\par
Safe Zone established!\par
You have entered safe zone [unclaimed]\par
Faction: [unclaimed]\par
Health Effect: Regeneration increased 10\%\par
\par
Nothing changed that he could see. The ground wasn’t terraformed nor cleaned. The heaps of ash was still there. But a blue dot had popped up in the middle of his mini-map, right at the intersection of the Forest’s three regions. He picked his way toward it.\par
He found the other survivors already there, even Brad and his grunts, still tied up and gagged. They stood amid a grassy plain, huddled around this stone pillar straight out of the Old Testament. It was carved with script from a language he’d never seen.\par
Beside the blue dot on his mini-map—that pillar—was a fat yellow dot—a treasure chest spawned next to it, the size of a small shed. It wasn’t opened. The survivors seemed nervous to get too close to it; they were looking at him, waiting.\par
"Is it done?" said Raj, one of the techies. His eyes were red-rimmed.\par
"Yeah. All dead,” said Zane. “And I saw no Monsters on the way here. Did you?”\par
They all shook their heads.\par
"I’m guessing they don’t spawn in Safe Zones,” he said. It makes sense. The Bosses were all dead. \par
They seemed less relieved than he expected. Liam, the pre-med, piped up—"So," he croaked. "Err—when is this—" he gestured around. "When’s it over? Can we—I don’t know—I just want to go home." His voice was strangled at the end.\par
Zane didn’t, but he didn’t say that. “We may have to accept,” he said slowly. “That’s no longer a possibility.” \par
Even little Annie looked upset at that. \par
He saw it now. Maybe they thought after the Dungeon was cleared, everything would be back the way it was and all this would fade like a bad dream. But though they were out, this world, with its mad game logic, was still there. There was no going back. \par
If he was their leader, he’d probably have to dredge up some inspirational speech or something right about now. But he wasn’t, and it was a good thing too—he was shit at speeches. \par
"What’s in the chest?" said Zane.\par
They looked at one another. “Well… we thought you should be the one to open it," said Cale, scratching his head, sheepish. \par
Zane had told them he didn’t want to be their leader, but they seemed to be subconsciously deferring to him anyways. Eh. \par
He walked up and pried it open. His face was bathed in yellow light. They looked like those crystals in the Highlands but clean cut, and stuffed brighter with essence. There must be dozens of them in there.\par
Still, probably not enough for him to clear a Level. But it was definitely something.\par
The rest of them gathered round, gasping. "Guess this is the reward for clearing the dungeon," muttered Zane.\par
"They’re yours—take them, man. They should be yours," said Cale, nodding earnestly. "Without you, none of us would be here."\par
Zane thought about demurring, then shrugged. "Sure."\par
“There’s more," said Cale, pointing to the beacon. “Take a look at this thing!”\par
Zane did. A box popped up.\par
\par
Would you like to claim this Safe Zone?\par
\par
"None of you claimed it?" \par
“Well… we thought it’d be best if we waited for you," said Cale.\par
"You don’t have to. Cale, you’re leader, remember?"\par
"Yeah, but…" Cale fidgeted. "I think you should claim it. It’s only right.” \par
Everyone else nodded in agreement: Old lady Mara, the athlete Elena, Liam, the high schoolers, Raj, Annie and her mom, even Sophie… they were all looking at Zane like he was their last hope. He wasn’t sure how he felt about it. The tale has been illicitly lifted; should you spot it on Amazon, report the violation.\par
He sighed. "Sure, sure." He didn’t much care either way.\par
He willed himself to accept.\par
\par
Which faction will claim this territory?\par
If you would like to make a new faction, you may.\par
\par
Zane frowned at it. "We need a name. For our faction, whatever that is. Anyone got one?"\par
Silence. "Okay, fine," he said. “Luminous Faction it is." It didn’t really matter.\par
Then—\par
\par
Safe Zone claimed!\par
Faction: Luminous Faction\par
Members: \par
Zane Walker\par
Diana Xu\par
Annie Xu\par
Raj Patel\par
Mara Greenway\par
Cale Rennick\par
Sophie Lowe\par
Liam Trainor \par
Eliot Caskell \par
Kim Park\par
Gerald Reeves\par
Brad Green\par
Ralph Neuberger\par
Zach Olsson\par
\par
A menu popped up before him:\par
\par
Safe Zone F tier\par
Upgrade\par
Shop\par
Map\par
Trade in\par
\par
He scratched his head. "It’s giving me a menu," he said. "Hold on."\par
He tried ‘Upgrade.’ \par
\par
Would you like to upgrade the safe zone to E Tier? Unlocks communication network: ability to communicate with other E-rank and above Safe Zones. Cost: 1000 essence stones.\par
\par
If the stuff in the chest were essence stones, they had nowhere near that.\par
He went to the next. "There’s a shop here," he muttered. "Hold on, can you all see this?"\par
They squinted at the Beacon, then let out gasps of surprise. Apparently so.\par
The shop had all sorts of goodies—there were basic necessities, like food and water, but they seemed tailored to the local cuisine. The food was salmon, Dungeness crab, apples, pears, kale, wild mushrooms, venison; the drinks coffee, clam chowder. All of them cost essence stones. Then there were materials for shelter: stone, concrete, something called ‘spirit steel.’ There were picks and axes and other such tools to make them. They all cost essence stones too.\par
Most intriguing, though, was what you couldn’t buy. Beneath a section marked Locked were—\par
Skill Books. Treasure Areas. Training Zones, Teleportation Gateways, Defensive Wards, Resource Generation, Interstellar Teleportation Gateway... \par
Hold on. Interstellar?\par
The implications were a little mind-boggling. \par
"Has anyone found a phone? Can I buy one?" It was one of the teens, a freckled brunette girl. She held up a phone with a cracked screen. "Mine hasn't worked since the change..."\par
"Mine hasn't either," mumbled another teen.\par
“I’ve got to call my mom—it's been like four days, she'll be worried sick!"\par
No one answered her. Zane sighed.\par
He directed his attention to the map option, and it unfurled something like a mini-map but much bigger—a macro map? It looked like one of those political maps that showed the counties. Washington State, split up into dozens, maybe hundreds of little puzzle pieces. \par
And he was smack dab in the middle of one near the very southern edge—‘Luminous Forest — F grade.’ But his was green while everything around him was red; almost all of the zones on the map were red. He supposed green meant safe zone... were the rest dungeons?\par
The majority of them seemed of F-rank. But he did spot an E tantalizingly close by. They seemed to cluster around cities... no, that wasn’t right—if you had to guess, their size was according to population density. And these huge barren forests, a dungeon could stretch hundreds of miles. Up there in the Seattle area, though, they were much smaller; you could fit several to a city. He saw a few D-ranks there. Up near the Canadian border, there was even a C-rank.\par
He was surprised to find he wasn’t the only safe zone either. Several yellow dots cropped up near Spokane, Vancouver, the Tri-Cities area, and shockingly, almost half of Seattle was a safe zone. Maybe it shouldn’t have been so shocking; there were so many people living there. They could probably handle most dungeons by virtue of sheer numbers. Meanwhile, he was stuck here pretty much by himself.\par
There was still a C-rank dungeon right in the heart of Seattle—a red dot surrounded by green. He wondered if there were teams of fighters throwing themselves at it even now. There must be whole organizations by now dedicated to going around clearing dungeons. They must have been at it for days already.\par
He wondered how strong they were. The thought tickled him. Somehow, the thought of others growing stronger out there… it made him want to get going himself. \par
Luminous Forest was one green shard surrounded by F-rank red shards. But go a little farther and you’d start finding E-tier shards, shards named Sunken Harbor and Shattered Mountains. He wondered what sick treasures and monsters lurked there.\par
Something about this map—the possibilities of it, the Monsters, but the humans too, working just as he was… he was getting antsy, itchy. He couldn’t sit still any longer. \par
The dungeon right under the Luminous Forest was a long strip of an F-ranked dungeon called ‘Snaring Thickets.’ If it was anything like this dungeon, at his current strength he could wipe it in a day—and be on to the other ones, the E ranked ones, the dangerous ones.\par
“I’m going for a hike,” he announced to the group. They seemed quite dismayed at that.\par
“Uh. Cool, man. Take care!” said Cale. “…What should we do?”\par
“Learn to answer that yourself,” said Zane. He sighed. “Look, this is your life now. You can either stand there and deny it, and let it roll you over. Or you can accept it, and bite down, and do the shit that needs to be done. I can see you’re scared. But you don’t have to let that feeling own you. It’ll keep you weak. I don’t know much about this new world, but one thing’s clear—if you want to survive you’ll need all the strength you can get. Got it?” \par
Slowly, Cale nodded. The rest of them were staring wide-eyed at him. They seemed to hang on to his every word.\par
“Tell you what,” he said. He pointed to the treasure chest. “Take it. All yours. They’re just stones and at my level, they won’t make much difference. Buy what you need, build shelter, absorb their essence. Train. Make something of this place. Make something of yourself. Can you do that for me?”\par
He felt like he was talking to a frightened child—like he was talking to Annie again as she was curled up in a ball, cringing from those wild Boars. Strangely, it was the little girl who seemed to take his words most to heart. She nodded vigorously; her eyes were shining. “I won’t let you down!”\par
“Yeah, you can count on us, Chief,” said one of the teens.\par
Zane groaned. “Look, I’m not your—just Zane is fine. Cale’s your leader. I plan on spending my time out adventuring, clearing dungeons… I’ll use this place as a home base every once in a while. If I have to be something, I guess I’m your… I don’t know…guardian spirit?”\par
Even that sounded a bit much. He had no desire to be their hero or leader or whatever, but he couldn’t just leave them out to dry. They seemed like decent people. If he saw a wounded critter by the side of the road, he couldn’t just walk away. He didn’t mind offering this little bit of help; it wasn’t like it messed with his plans. Who knew? In return, maybe they’d give him a place to come back to.\par
They seemed okay with that.\par
They were bustling, unloading the treasure chest, trading with the Beacon, sitting down to train when he set off. He wondered what he’d find when he came back.\par
For now, though—off to the next one!\par
\par


\section{15. Dungeon Crawling (I) }
\par
When the F-rank dungeon ‘Snaring Thickets’ spawned, it caught twenty-three people.\par
Now there were only six left. They huddled in one of the few clearings they could find in the endless sea of twisting, shifting, poison-spiked vines. \par
This Dungeon had just one boss, the Gnarled Horror. Over the past five days, it and its minions had hunted them down one by one. \par
All that remained were a hiker, three high schoolers, a wildlife researcher, a forest ranger.\par
They huddled together, wondering how many days they had left. Ever since poor Dale had sacrificed himself to fend off the beast, they’d been running. They’d ran for three days straight. They had maybe a day’s worth of rations left. Then… \par
Jim shook his head. He was the forest ranger. He was nearly fifty, balding and paunchy, and gruff-voiced, the oldest of the bunch by a margin. He’d become the de facto leader. It was on him to be strong for them. God, they were so young… some of them, especially the high schoolers—Sam, Taylor, Liana… they could’ve been his son, his daughter. \par
“This has to end,” he rasped. “One way or another.” \par
Lucy—the frizzy-haired wildlife researcher—stared at him. “What are you saying?” \par
“I’m saying,” he said, breathing heavy. “It’s time I stopped running.” \par
It took a second for the others to get his meaning. Then—\par
"Nahh," said Taylor, scrambling back. "Nah man, we're not doing this. You're not making me fight that thing!"\par
The three of them had driven out here to get high and do God knows what else teenagers did—have fun, make the most of their youth. Now they were stuck here… they had so much life to live. It broke Jim’s heart.\par
"You don't understand," he said. "I don't mean you. I mean me. We're running out of food, out of time… that thing has got to go." He sighed heavily. "There’s no other way."\par
“No, no, no, listen to yourself!” said Lucy, faster and faster. She clutched at his arm. “There has to be another way, there just has to be!” \par
"Believe me,” croaked Jim. “I’m not slap-happy about this either. But what’ll we do? Crawl around, and starve, and wait for those little green shits to shank us?"\par
He shook his head. He could see how scared they all were; they were so scared he doubted they could move, much less fight.\par
"Look," he said, trying to soften his voice. "Y'all will be better off without me. I’m old. I’ll just slow you down. And you can stretch the rations some more."\par
"You don't have to do this," whispered Lucy.\par
Jim shook his head. Then he set his jaw and breathed out harshly. "Who's coming with me?"\par
None of them met his eyes.\par
None of them but Sam. Tall, lanky, seventeen, with braces and twice-broken glasses he’d lost days ago. Now he was squinting at everything. He was some kind of nerd before all this, Jim gathered—some kind of computer wiz. When they met, he looked like he hadn't spent a day outdoor in his life.\par
But he was the only one to stand, and Jim respected the hell out of him for it. Some folk shrank when duty called. But some folk found they had heart they never knew they had. He was just level 8. Jim was barely Level 14. That thing was well past Level 20. They knew exactly what they were getting into, but they stood anyways. That had to mean something. \par
Sam swallowed, gazing out at them all. "I know I'm not very strong," he said. "But… Mama always said I should give it my all. I'm not going out running.” He dabbed at his eyes. “If, uh, I don't make it back… please tell my sis big brother's sorry he couldn't make it to her piano recital… he tried his best.” The boy was nearly in tears. He was getting choked up. \par
Jim nodded, a lump in his throat. "No matter what happens, kid, you ought to be proud of yourself. Let’s give this bastard hell."\par
"Yes, sir!"\par
"No," said the Ranger with a grim smile. "Call me Jim.” \par
Sam nodded, blinking. "... Okay. Jim."\par
Jim felt a sudden kinship with the boy. It was the kind of bond you could only make in times like these, when your life was on the line, when you had to trust each other utterly, totally.\par
“Let’s do this,” he gritted out. \par
They stood as one, and put on brave faces, though their hearts thumped so loud Jim was sure the rest of them could hear it. It was time to face fate. Jim's dad had fought in Korea—he earned a Purple Heart charging a regiment to save his division, and it was him Jim had in his heart. It was these moments, these little moments, that made a man. It was time to see who he truly was—\par
“Uh,” said Taylor.\par
"What?!" growled Jim. He was so strung up and tense it came out harsher than he meant.\par
“Uh—who's that?”\par
A man was sauntering through the forest. A massive, shirtless man streaked in grime and soot. He didn't seem real at first. He looked like the villain in an 80's action movie—like Terminator's nastier younger brother. His face was a chiseled, impassive mask. He walked like he owned the place.\par
Jim had to double-check his mini-map to make sure that guy wasn't a Monster. White dot, but with an S on it… "What the hell?” he muttered.This story has been taken without authorization. Report any sightings.\par
The man turned to them and Jim flinched. They all did. They didn't mean to—just an instinct.\par
\par
Zane Walker\par
Essence Level 35\par
Type: Creature\par
\par
For a moment, Jim just stood there, gaping at him. He blinked. That couldn't be right. That—thirty-five?!\par
"Morning," said the man, waving. He sounded bored. "Where's the boss?"\par
None of them spoke.\par
He frowned. “Hello?” \par
"Over there," said Sam faintly. He pointed a trembling hand. "Through those brushes, follow the tree line. Can't miss it."\par
"Thanks." The man wandered off as casually as he came. He vanished through the bushes; the rustling was soon gone. There was no evidence he'd ever been there.\par
They were all staring at the spot where he left.\par
Jim turned to the rest of them, shaking. “Did you see that?”\par
They nodded. "It said—said thirty-five,” whispered Lucy, looking pale. \par
Taylor choked. "How’s that even possible? Where’d he come from?!"\par
Just then, there was a massive shriek, the ground rattled; Jim had to grab hold of the nearest tree to stop from going over. There was a roaring, a crackling, a hissing; it felt like they were stuck in the middle of an invisible storm. Lucy started to scream.\par
Then she stopped. Everything stopped.\par
There was a strange, sudden breathless quiet.\par
\par
Gnarled Horror has been slain!\par
Objectives met: 1/1\par
F-Rank Dungeon Snaring Thickets cleared!\par
Converting to Safe Zone…\par
\par
"What?!" Jim croaked. He couldn’t seem to stop trembling. "What the fuck?!”\par
\par
***\par
\par
Well, that was easy.\par
The dungeon was long but not very wide, and it only had one boss this time. Zane wondered if this was the norm.\par
He'd come across it in a clearing, kind of like the Hobgoblin Chief’s, except the ground here was made of seething poisoned vines—like a snake's nest. And the monster held court at the center of it, this horror made of hundreds of thousands of spiked vines coiling into each other.\par
It was a very silly monster, in that it tried to strangle him. You don't strangle a strangler—doesn't work like that. Especially a strangler who could set his coils on fire.\par
This time, he didn't even use his fire. Too easy. He felt it'd be more fun to go strangle for strangle with it. He coiled his chains around its body. It coiled its vines around him. It did a decent job trying to tug him apart. But he wrapped it tight, making sure he wrapped every angle of it like he was wrapping a Christmas present, and then squeezed, and squeezed, and squeezed. A stupid brute force method, but hell if it wasn't fun! Just when he was starting to burn out his strength, when he was thinking he might need to try something else, it burst. Turns out vines were a lot like water balloons if you squeeze them hard enough.\par
All the plant gore dissolved to white, flowed into him.\par
\par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 35 -> 36\par
Skill up! \par
Chain Mastery I -> II\par
\par
Hey, neat.\par
He took a look at his mini-map. The beacon was way behind—he'd have to backtrack. On the way back, he met the folk who'd given him directions—they were still there, still having their little picnic. He wondered if they were shy. They didn't seem to talk much.\par
“Hey”, he said. “…Do you understand me? Hello?” \par
 They all nodded, slowly. \par
"Okay, good. I'm going to claim this for my Faction. It should be safe to live in now. Y'all have a problem with that?"\par
They shook their heads dumbly.\par
"You look like shit," he informed them. "There're survivors up north. They're building a settlement, training, growing… maybe go join them. Could help." He shrugged. "Oh, and I'll leave a chest by the beacon. Take that with you. Give it to a guy named Cale—he'll know what to do with it.”\par
He wandered off.\par
***\par
Next up was the E-rank dungeon, but before then, he tried out that Law thing again. He found a clearing and started setting trees on fire.\par
He must have done it for an hour, melting tree after tree, staring deeply into the flames. Trying to see if he could force open whatever crack he had found before. No. It was like he suspected—the door was closed. He couldn't make it open. Maybe there was a way he didn’t know about, but again, no Tutorial. Which was a shame, because this Law stuff might be his favorite trick so far.\par
He needed to do was look at something, reach out with his mind, and pull a string on the other side. And it would burst into flame. It didn't feel like a Skill—it didn't use essence, but it could magnify and modify essence. Odd.\par
Hopefully he'd stumble across another one of these sooner or later. It said Minor Law, didn't it? Minor Law of Ignition. It was part of a ‘Elemental Law of Fire.’ And if there was a Minor, shouldn't there be a Major? How deep did this rabbit hole go?\par
And Ignition was a tiny part of Fire. What else was there? ... Burning, maybe? Combustion? Would they stack?\par
He supposed he'd see.\par
\par
***\par
\par
The farther south he moved, the more he got a sense of déjà vu. When integration happened, the landscape had been totally reshuffled. But sometimes, he swore he saw parts of the old peeking out under the surface of the new. Even if the trees looked different and the grass did too… something about this chunk of forest felt familiar. But he couldn't place it.\par
He was nearing the edge of the border between this F-ranked dungeon and his target—the E-ranked dungeon he'd seen below it. It loomed up before him, blue walls bounding it from the Safe Zone. These blue boundary walls—like the walls of a boss’s lair lock—seemed to be one way. You could go through them, but once you were all the way through, there was no going back.\par
The demarcation was clear. Unlike the slinking wavy trees of the Snaring Thicket Dungeon, the trees on that side were ramrod straight and scruffed with fluffy purple boughs. They kind of looked like the firs near his old workplace. The purple grass here was cut low to the ground. On one side of the border, the grass went up to the shins; it fell suddenly, uncannily.\par
He stepped across.\par
\par
You have entered: Dungeon: Iron Labyrinth (E)\par
Clearance Objective: \par
Slay the Mechanical Sentinel \par
Slay the Lightning Kraken\par
Objectives met: 0/2\par
\par
He strode in feeling giddy.\par
 Iron Labyrinth? Odd. He didn't see any iron around. As far as he could tell, the dungeons seemed to modify what was already there; if there were trees, it made a forest dungeon. He picked his way through the forest, looking around. What iron? In his past life there was only one source of iron round these parts. And that was… \par
He saw a red dot pop up in his mini-map. As he neared it he heard it—a deep thumping drawing closer, saw it rattling the trees, trembling the ground. Something immensely heavy. Each step jittered the ground—\par
He pushed through a block of bushes and saw it. \par
“…What the fuck.” \par
He’d seen this thing before. In his nightmares. Its head was one huge dented steel box, crushed in. Its arms were rusted steel plate, pipe, ending at steel box-clubs for hands. Its whole body went down block after block welded haphazardly together; its torso was a shipping container. He must’ve moved a thousand of the fucking things with a ratty old forklift back when he worked in the warehouse. \par
\par
Box Golem (Monster)\par
Essence Level 29\par
\par
Now he knew why this place looked so familiar… \par
The thing opened its crushed-in mouth—he wasn’t sure how it had one—and let out a metallic screech. It lumbered towards him. \par
\par


\section{16. Dungeon Crawling (II) }
\par
So he was right. Dungeons modified what was already there. In this case, you could still see some of the paint on the steel—what looked like the word "warning" was wrapped around its chest in block letters.\par
Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.\par
\par
Skills:\par
Steel Tremor (Active) [Common]\par
Slams into the ground, inducing a localized earthquake. This skill is not only a direct attack but also alters the terrain temporarily.\par
\par
Container Cannonade (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Detaches parts of its container body and hurls them with piston-like force towards its enemies.\par
\par
He looked for its weakness, and thought for a moment it had none. Then he squinted and saw it—those slits with the boxes connected the joints where crate met pipe lit up red. It made sense. Punching it seemed like a very stupid idea. He might have seven Levels on the thing, but he was still pretty sure his hand wasn't harder than steel.\par
Dismantling it, though? Very doable. \par
It rushed him. It wasn't well-oiled; every joint of it creaked, squealed as it barreled past. He skated easily out of the way. Its enormous arms struck a tree, swiped clean through it, and it practically leapt off its stump. It crash-landed into another tree and snapped it in half too. Branches rained. \par
Yeah, I'm not getting close to that thing. So he drew out his chains and waited for it to circle back around, huffing and creaking.\par
When it came at him again, he ducked out and wrapped its near arm in a chain, sliding it right around the elbow, and yanked, jerking it close. Then he took the chance to wrap the other around the shoulder joint.\par
Promethean noose!\par
The chains flared white, and there was a shrill hissing. The golem tried wrenching out its arm, but once Zane had a bite, you'd have an easier time knocking him out than making him let go. He had that in deep, and he held.\par
Streams of melted steel dripped out. The arm began to sag. The golem let out another shriek, ripped hard—and ended up stumbling away, crashing to the ground.\par
Its arm flapped free the other way, still smoking. The joints glowed white-hot.\par
As the thing came up to a knee, it found a chain looping around its neck. It tried grabbing for it, but another caught it around the wrist, yanking it back. It went for another tumble. It wouldn't get back up.\par
Laws of Ignition danced down the chains' black length. He felt them bite into the thick steel of the neck, felt the hardness give way, felt his chains crunch in, squeezing out the slack. Steel pulled out in a steaming puddle. The golem jerked one last time and was still.\par
It was kind of like taking apart a very big Lego, Zane thought. Poor thing hadn't even gotten to fire off a skill.\par
One of these were no trouble… but a horde of them rushing him at once? Interesting… sounded like good fun.\par
The forest started clearing quick as he made his way deeper in. His mini map showed a clearing in the shape of a rectangle. And at its center…\par
Zane whistled. “Fuck. It's really still here.”\par
This was where his warehouse used to be. It had been a plain metal box, aggressively nondescript. It was what he imagined purgatory must look like.\par
The monstrosity before him looked similar—he could see how it got from there to here. But if his old warehouse was purgatory, this must be a circle of hell.\par
It was less warehouse and more fortress. Towering walls of corrugated metal streaked with rust and tar loomed against a bleak gray sky. It had two floors, the first a sprawling expanse of weathered steel and concrete, its flat windowless walls broken up only by a black maw of an entrance run over with barbed wire. Above, the second floor overhanging slightly, making it seem a watchful brooding presence. Tesla coils lining the roof buzzed slightly, giving the whole thing a flickering electric-blue halo.\par
He heard a constant rhythmic pounding, like hundreds of blacksmiths working at once, alongside the clanking of steel on steel. It was enough to give you a migraine.\par
After he got past the shock of it, Zane started to wonder. Were all the buildings still there, just changed somehow? Was his apartment some kind of death trap now, and what about the Seattle Needle, the Golden Gate Bridge, were they still there, just… different?\par
He blinked—a sound jerked him back to the present. Was that screaming? He looked up at his mini map.\par
New clusters showed up. White dots spread on the other side of the clearing. He frowned, staring across. There were corrugated steel plates thrown up on the other side of the clearing, right about where the dots were. Those were people. They'd barricaded themselves in.\par
Around them was a mass of X’s.\par
There must have been the people trapped at the warehouse when integration came, the day shift people clocking in. This all used to be a parking lot…\par
More red dots were ambling out of the fortress maw. More box golems. A cluster made for the people; out came a flurry of essence—red and blue and white—mages? Bolts of pure essence split the air. That had to be from a bow, surely. The golems stumbled back, groaning. He heard shouts. There must have been dozens of them—\par
“Are you crazy?!”If you encounter this story on Amazon, note that it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\par
He blinked, turned, just as something grabbed him by the arm and yanked him behind the tree. He came face to face with an angry looking lady. She was sweating pretty hard. “Do you have a death wish?!” She hissed.\par
“Uh—”\par
“What's your name?”\par
She was in her early 20s, with sharp eyes and her hair pulled back in a ponytail. Her face was dirt-streaked but still distractingly beautiful. She looked familiar. She wore a tattered brown jacket, and a pin there marked her out as a manager. In her hands was a long white staff, crowned with a glowing fist-sized blue gem. \par
“I'm Zane,” he said.\par
“Get back to camp, now! The eastern front’s going down, we need more bodies!” \par
He identified her.\par
\par
Reina Torres (Creature)\par
Essence Level 27\par
Class: Aegis Cleric\par
\par
That was a lot stronger than he was expecting. A full ten levels over anyone he’d seen—except himself. She must’ve really gone after it. \par
She was still ranting. “You should know better than to wander out alone! You—”\par
She stopped to look at him—really look at him. Then her demeanor totally changed. Her stern look froze, then melted. Her eyes went wide. She must’ve identified him too. “Uh,” she said. She let him go. She went kind of limp.\par
“Yeah,” he said. “I'm not from here.”\par
A pause. “Who are you?”\par
“Zane Walker. I told you.”\par
“No, I mean—did the feds send you? Are you here to help us?”\par
“I'm here on my own. As for helping…” he was here to fight the bosses. But it did have the neat and pretty accidental benefit of helping these folks out, he supposed. He shrugged. “Sure. Why not? Who are you?” \par
“I’m Reina. I lead the survivors back there.” She jerked her head at the barricades. \par
“I need you to do something for me,” he said.\par
She nodded quickly.\par
“You've been here a while, yes?” He gestured to the fortress. “What's going on in there?”\par
She started telling him. She was stuttering a little, and he could tell this wasn’t the sort of person used to stuttering. \par
He remembered where he’d seen her before. In the few times he’d visited the warehouse during the day, he’d seen this woman prowling the warehouse floor, stern-faced, snapping orders. No doubt that kind of attitude got her her role now. But speaking to him she was almost timid. Unlike those Snaring Thickets people, at least she could firmly meet his eyes. \par
Ever since integration—maybe ever since he started Leveling—he seemed to have gotten this strange aura, the stranger effect. Everyone seemed constantly nervous around him. Part of it was the look. He was a lot bigger; he'd filled out a lot more; he dwarfed pretty much everyone he spoke to now. But it was more than that. Something about the power difference seemed to get to people.\par
She told him there were two floors, each with one boss, each with its own region. The first-floor boss was a steel brute of a thing, like those golems it spawned, only more so. It was Level 41, and surrounded by minions. The second-floor boss they’d only gotten a brief glimpse at. Level 48, and it wielded lightning—that was all they knew. They had their hands full trying to fend off the first one. \par
48… That was a pretty big jump. \par
“Did you find any treasure areas?” he asked.\par
She stared blankly at him. “You mean resource zones?”\par
“The yellow dots, whatever.”\par
Reina looked a little guilty. “We took them all. We had to. There's that Cavern of Insight, but that's it—it’s all outside. The insides are just boss lairs stacked on each other.”\par
He mulled all this over in silence. “I can help you,” Reina said suddenly. “Let me tag along.” \par
He thought about it. It wasn't so much that he didn't trust her, more that he didn't her to not get in his way. "Appreciate the offer," he said. "But there's no need."\par
"Why not?" She looked wounded.\par
To be polite, he said, “I do better on my own.” \par
“I—my subclass, Aegis Cleric, all it does is buff and protect!” she said. She seemed frustrated. “I chose it for them. I wanted to help.” \par
She jerked her head back at the survivors. “But it’s… it’s not enough. Buff a Level 12, they still can’t take out a Level 25 Golem. I’m trying so goddamned hard…but I just, I can’t… with you it’ll be different. Let me help you end this. I swear you won’t regret it!” \par
He considered her for a long moment. \par
“You’re strong, but you’re still fighting up a level gap,” she said. “Especially against the second-floor boss. I can heal, make shields, cast buffs—I’ll help bridge that.” \par
Valid points. \par
“You’ll have to fend for yourself. If they come for you, that’s on you. I fight solo. I won’t be able to protect you,” he said at last. \par
“I don’t want you to protect me,” she said. There was steel in her eyes; it reassured him. She seemed for real. “I want you to end this.” \par
“…” He shrugged. “Alright.” \par
\par
***\par
\par
“Ready?” said Reina. \par
He nodded, and she let out a breath, and her staff began to glow.\par
\par

\par
Together, they marched for the first lair. \par
He heard shouts from the other side of the clearing—the others must have seen him and Reina walking out. Seeing them striding up to the mouth of the first boss lair. They were greeted at the entrance by two box golems. One Level 24, one Level 25.\par
It was a simple game of keep away with these ones. Slip between them, away from them, keep the body out of reach—then when the time was right, sling a noose around their necks, and clamp it tight. He burned through one, then the other with ease. Reina had barely gotten halfway through her spell. When he turned, he saw her staring at him. She shook herself out of it. \par
He heard the other survivors’ shouts grow louder too. The maw of an entrance gaped at them. They strolled on through.\par
The moment they did—\par
\par
Lair Lock! \par
The Mechanical Sentinel has locked its lair.\par
\par
A blue wall sealed the door behind them. He heard Reina’s breath start to quicken, but when he took a sidelong glance at her he found her jaw set as strong as always—though her fingers were white-knuckled on the staff. \par
“I’m good,” she gritted at him. “Let’s do this.” \par
The lair was run over with fat steel pipes, twisting up and down the walls, snaking over the floors. Gears and pistons whirred in a jarring symphony. Steam hissed from unseen vents, and the air was thick with the smell of oil and rusted steel. Steel racks stood here and there, seemingly at random. At the center of this mechanical mess stood the boss. \par
\par
Mechanical Sentinel (Monster)\par
Essence Level 41\par
\par
It was like four or five Box Golems strapped together; even sitting it towered twenty-odd feet. Its joints were strapped in by what looked like conveyer belt cables. In the middle of its torso lay its heart—this dim yellow core which flared to life as it stood. \par
It loomed over them, gears whirring, eyes shining a bright red light. \par
Zane licked his lips. Okay. Let's dance.\par
\par


\section{17. Dungeon Crawling (III) }
\par
His old tricks wouldn’t work anymore. That two lives gambit only worked if he could shove in enough essence at once to push himself over the top. Now he needed a ridiculous amount of essence to move the needle. It was rare he was ever a few Moon Fruit away from a level-up. Only killing a boss would do it, really.\par
Which meant his margin of error right now was tiny. No do-overs. One fuck up, life over.\par
Maybe against the Keeper he had a little more leeway. But as he looked up at this monstrous colossus, he got the sense it could trip and fall on him, and that'd be it. That was tons upon tons upon tons of reinforced steel…\par
And by the looks of it, it knew how to use it.\par
\par
Mechanical Sentinel\par
Essence Level 41\par
\par
 \par
Hydraulic Punch (Active) [Uncommon]\par
 The Sentinel’s hands piston out with the force of a hydraulic press. A punch which can\par
shatter reinforced steel.\par
\par
 \par
 Steel Storm (Active) [Uncommon]\par
 The Sentinel unleashes a whirlwind of jagged metal at supersonic speeds, dealing massive area of effect damage\par
\par
Its weakness lit up red—its chest. It had a core there, bright yellow, but Zane had a strong suspicion it like with the Behemoth. Another honey trap. That core lay behind walls of steel and thick glass. There was no way he was getting to it. Besides, he had nothing piercing nor concussive to blast it with. His strengths were strangling and burning. Better to play to his strengths than bend over backwards trying to exploit the others’ weakness. He’d learned the hard way. \par
The Sentinel struck first, swallowing half the room in a stride. He leapt up to meet it. His plan was simple—do the same thing he did with those Box Golems. Just bigger.\par
But the moment he tried looping his Chain around his arm, its bus-sized hand whipped out and snatched it right out of the air. He dangled there, stunned—something that big should not be able to move that fast.\par
Then it yanked, and he went flying. Shit! There was no time to put his other Chain between them. That fist was closing in fast, raging with essence—a Hydraulic Punch was coming. Oh, this thing is good. \par
All he could do was throw up his arms and grit his teeth. The fist shot out—\par
A blue shield flickered in front of his face. It caught the punch—for half a second. Then it shattered into a thousand brilliant shards. But that half-second was enough. He threw up his other Chain, got it between his body and the fist. He blocked it.\par
It didn't feel like it.\par
It crushed him into the ground like a boot crushes a gnat. His ears popped, his vision went black.\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
The fist receded and he scrambled out, choking in air. Everything hurt. He felt like all his bones were shattered inside him—how was he still upright? It hit this hard even partly blocked? Shit. He grinned.\par
He heard a gasp. It was Reina, splayed out against the ground, coughing blood. That blue shield had been hers. \par
No time to check on her, no time to think on it. The Sentinel was stomping at him again. It swung down a fist like a hammer, and he barely leapt out of the way. It swept it out, knocking over rows of racks, throwing them across the floor. He gritted his teeth. He had to keep running. \par
Lesson learned! Don't throw naked lunges at its arms. If they tried grappling his head, he imagined a similar thing would happen. Which was a shame, because that had been most of his plan. \par
Now he had to come up with a new one on the fly as the brute stomped after him, terraforming the ground in real-time. It was getting frighteningly close to him. He could see the craters it left where he'd been just moments before. He reached and he ducked, and his fingers closed just above his head. He felt the air whooshing by.\par
It was exhilarating.\par
Can't go for its head, might as well try its legs. It moved less, and it was closer too. But when he tried throwing his Chain around, he barely made a clean loop before one giant hand reached down and plucked it off almost contemptuously. This time, he let go of the Chains before it could drag him; they vanished. He re-summoned them as he ran.\par
So that didn't work either… one more try, then. This time he started running in loops like one of those cockroaches he'd seen with their heads cut off, going between its legs, around its legs, making it bend over trying to snatch at him, making it stomp at him. He didn't try to bind it. He just let his Chains make natural loops on the ground, like a fox trap.\par
Meanwhile, he felt a warm pulse touch his back.\par
\par
You have been afflicted by: Healing Touch\par
Health Effect: Health Restored 20\%\par
\par
Reina nodded at him from a dim corner. He was so busy running, he'd only forgotten she existed for a second—it was lucky she healed him then, because she ended up slotting into the last chunk of his plan. He had it—now he just had to do it. He felt truly unreasonably confident given he'd done precisely zero damage to that thing, and it had nearly ended him with one blow. He just had a good feeling.\par
Then he heard an ear-piercing sound like steel grinding against steel; he looked up. And nearly got his eye poked out by a nail going supersonic. A jagged steel plate whizzed by, ripped up his arm; another cut a huge gash down his leg. It was spewing Steel Storm at him. Another blue field shimmered into being. This time, it lasted maybe three seconds before collapsing, along with its maker.\par
Zane felt a little bad asking now, of all times, but—"You said you had a disorientation skill, right?!” The narrative has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the infringement.\par
She nodded, in between hacking gobs of blood.\par
"Can you still throw it?" He had to shout as loud as he could. It was hard making himself heard over that staccato hailstorm, but again she nodded. "On three," he said, pointing at its face.\par
She screamed something at him—as he ducked between the sentinel's legs, he missed half the words, but it was something like—it won't do anything! And she was right. The Level difference was too big. It’d be like being stung between the eyes at best. Still, he said, “On three!"\par
To his relief, she trusted him; she nodded. He made one last loop. Two, three— \par
A dark pulse rippled through the air and clocked the Sentinel right on the side of the head. Good shot. And she was right. It didn't do anything.\par
Except make it turn to her, and piss it off.\par
It roared, a sound like thousands of stuck gears grinding. Then it lunged for her. She shrieked.\par
At the same time, Zane yanked. \par
And his little tripwire, triply reinforced, shunted into the air. It wound in on itself, binding the Sentinel's legs together. The Monster could only flail, grasping uselessly, as it began to topple the way skyscrapers topple, slowly but ponderously, inevitably. \par
*** \par
Reina saw it.\par
As that Monster fell, splaying its hands in a futile try at righting itself, she saw it—what Zane must have seen all along. She gasped—there was a sliver of a chance! He had to go now, seize that split second—\par
And he did.\par
She saw him lunge up the back of its legs even as it toppled, leap up its back, climbing higher and higher, racing for the neck. As the monster put out its hands to break its fall—hands that, crucially, lay tens of feet from its neck—he looped one Chain around. Then he turned, throwing around another Chain even as one of its massive hands got free and swatted at him. She saw his face—the sheer glee in it. But he wasn't manic; he wasn't flailing, spasming. He moved like a machine. The hand swept over him, barely missing. But his eyes weren’t on the thing about to crush him; it was like he didn't care about that at all. All he cared about was executing. He swerved smoothly around it, all poise. \par
He'd said this was his plan earlier. To put his Chains around the Sentinel’s neck and burn it through, but she couldn't believe she was actually seeing it. It was like something out of an action movie—it didn't make any sense, it was so... clean. Didn’t he see the hands coming to crush him?! It was like he didn't believe they could touch him.\par
The Chains locked tight, flared white. And a hiss poured out. \par
"Oh my God," she whispered. He was really doing it! He was—\par
Then the Sentinel’s hands reached over, dropping long shadows over Zane's head.\par
"Run!" she screamed, despairing. It was all she could do. She'd run out of essence. But he couldn’t run—he was locked in too tight! \par
He looked up. And even in the dark, she could see the gleam of his grinning teeth.\par
She felt faint. She realized then why he was so poised, so cool in the heat of the moment. It wasn't that he thought he was invincible.\par
He just didn't care.\par
And he was still smiling when the hands closed over him and squashed him like a fly.\par
She heard the crunching of bones as the hands closed tight, firming to fists. More crunching, sharper now, louder. He didn't cry out in pain; he didn't even scream; he just took it.\par
She saw rivers of blood trickling out from the iron fist.\par
She choked out a sob. There was a long silence.\par
She noticed something odd about the scene. \par
The Chains were still burning white.\par
Then that great steel head sloughed off the boss's shoulders, and cratered into the ground.\par
She gasped. "What…?"\par
The hands loosened, fell away, leaving the ruins of a body splayed out atop the steel corpse.\par
"Oh my God," she said again. His spine—his arms—his neck! It was all— She couldn't bear to look.\par
Then all that steel dissolved to white.\par
She saw a rush of it pour into her.\par

A buff for one’s teammates. Dampens the effect of all essence-based attacks by 10\% for a limited period. Effect and duration scale with level. \par
\par
But the bulk of the essence went to him. She hadn't thought he was still alive. But there was a flash, and a different body lay face down, limp on the ground. A whole body.\par
Zane picked himself up, brushing the dust off him, and made a face at his shirt. It had been badly torn. Then he shrugged at it, and his eyes met hers.\par
"Hey," he said, “Good work out there.” \par
She forgot to breathe. “How are you—” she got out. “How are you so calm?”\par
He shrugged. "Let me know when you're ready."\par
… Ready?\par
He nodded to the ceiling. "For the second floor. The other boss, I mean."\par
She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She wanted to crawl into her cot and sleep for a day straight.\par
"You good?" he asked, frowning. "You did Level Up, right?"\par
Numbly, she nodded.\par
"Great. So you're fully healed."\par
Was he the crazy one, or was she? "You almost died!"\par
He cocked a brow. "But I didn't, did I? No harm done."\par
This man… she felt weak at the knees. God. \par
***\par
It seemed Reina needed a little break before they went on. It was a mental thing, she said. He was happy to oblige. That worked out well.\par
After they cleared the boss, all its Box Golem minions vanished too. Which meant the other warehouse workers were safe—they were free to come in. They were mostly men, mostly young, mostly Level 17, 18, 12. No one of interest. But they seemed intent on hovering around Reina, asking repeatedly if she was alright, even after she said she was, multiple times—like they were lining up to be her protector. Which was funny, given the Level difference. \par
Zane could tell she'd be fine. He'd barely known her, but he'd fought with her; that was enough. She was shaken, but he could tell she had steel in her. She was rising to her feet even now, shaking out the cobwebs. She was good.\par
“Hey! You!” said one of the men, a fluffy-haired blond. He looked so young he could’ve been in college. Zane blinked. \par
“Yeah, you! I’m talking to you!” said the man. He was red-faced. \par
\par
Trent Miller (Creature)\par
Essence Level 9 \par
\par
“What were you thinking, running in here like that?! Can you imagine what would’ve happened if Miss Reina wasn’t here to save you? Risking your own life’s one thing, but you put the Miss in danger! You—” \par
“Quiet, Trent,” said Reina suddenly. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.” \par
She stood. “Zane’s not from here—he’s here to help. Without him, we might never have slain the first Boss. We should be thanking him.” \par
“But—“ Trent looked aggrieved, like it was unfair she was telling him off. “He—you—” \par
Zane saw the exact moment Trent Identified him. His words choked off suddenly; his eyes bulged. At first this kind of thing had annoyed Zane. Now he found it amusing. \par
The rest of the men—they seemed more like boys by the second to Zane—looked like the last thing they wanted to do was thank him. They seemed scared, wary, and… jealous? But her tone brooked no disagreement. So they did, mumbling. \par
“Zane,” said Reina, crossing her arms. Seemed she’d gotten her wits back. “I just got a new Skill. Give me a few hours to practice, and rest, and eat. Then we can head up. How’s that sound?” \par
He could see why the other workers deferred to her—other than the fact that most of them seemed in love with her. Now that she wasn’t as frazzled, she had a natural confidence to the way she spoke. \par
“Sure,” he said. What would he do in the meantime? Were there treasure areas around here—hadn’t she said something about… “What’s that Cavern of Insight you mentioned?” \par
\par


\section{18. Cavern of Insight }
\par
"It's useless," said Reina.\par
"Explain," said Zane.\par
"The description says it's meant to give you ‘insights into Law,’ whatever that means. But we looked. There's nothing there. Just a few old scratches on the walls."\par
Zane perked up. "Law, you said?"\par
Yeah. He was definitely checking this out.\par
They agreed to meet back before evening.\par
 "So it'll just be you two going up to fight that boss? You two together?” said another one of Reyna's lackeys—husky dude with a grizzled stubble, squinting eyes, and a few strands of hair desperately clinging to an otherwise bald pate. He seemed upset at the thought.\par
\par
Jimmy Nunn (Creature)\par
Class: Ranger \par
Essence Level 11\par
\par
"I don’t like it either. We can fight too, you know,” Trent grumbled. Zane was taken aback. Did they really think they could stand against a Level 48 boss? You'd think this world would’ve given them a reality check… then again. Most of the workers edged away from them, looking awkwardly at one another. They didn’t say a peep. So they weren’t all silly; it was just that the silly ones were the loudest. \par
"No," said Reina firmly. "All of you will stay here where you're safe. Let us take care of it."\par
He could tell they weren’t happy about it, but they didn’t dare say more. They settled for glaring at Zane. Zane sighed. Another thing he noticed post-Integration—there was this weird sense he got that some men felt very uncomfortable when he came around. They had a hard time meeting his eyes. Whatever it was, he didn’t care to entertain it. \par
*** \par
He made his way west, just as Reina said, and it wasn't long until they came across the Cavern entrance. It was a cave mouth burrowed into the side of a hill, and nothing would have marked it special except for the faint mist pouring out from it; it reminded him of the early morning mist he'd see so often around these parts.\par
Cavern of Insight\par
Caverns of Insight rarely spawn in dungeons. Each holds a secret of the universe, an aid of some sort which transmutes the comprehension of a Law. These take on various forms: a special environment, the teachings of an old master, profound visions, Law tomes, and so on. \par
As he stepped in, the air took on a dawn chill.\par
He was used to monsters guarding places like these, but they weren't here. They must’ve been cleared out before he came. His steps echoed down the dim, craggy tunnel. He couldn't tell outside, but here, against the gloom, he could see the mist was faintly glowing, spreading a corona of pale light.\par
Soon the tunnel opened up into a cavern. \par
At its center was a marble dais—other than the mist, it was the only thing there. Then he glanced at the walls and frowned.\par
Reina was right. There were only lines here. And they were just lines, lines running the length of the wall, one after another, seeming identical. At first. But the more he stared at them, the more his eyes started to unfocus.\par
He could feel it here, that tear in the fabric of the world. These scars had Laws etched in them. \par
He came up close, squinting at them, studying them one by one. They weren't the same; now he really paid attention he saw gradients. Each new line flowed a little sharper, a little cleaner—a little more effortlessly. Each line had a little more Law. He could imagine some old master sitting on that dais, alone, meditating on his Law—then practicing one by one, carving them until he made a full loop of the room. \par
At first glance, the last line was nearly identical to the first. But look deeper, past the surface, and it blazed with Law where the first twinkled. Look was the wrong term; it was just the closest thing he had. He felt it there with a sense he couldn't explain, a sixth sense, a sense of the soul.\par
Gently, he lifted a finger and touched that scar. Then pulled it away, hissing. Where he touched, his finger let out a stream of blood. Nothing had touched him physically. The lingering Law was so sharp it cut him anyways.\par
How long ago had this mysterious master sat here contemplating? Whoever it was, their Law was at a level he couldn't comprehend. When he came near those scars he felt the gravity of them, felt the way the universe bent to them… this Law was nothing Minor, like the one he had. \par
How’d this even get in the dungeon? He thought everything was freshly generated. Maybe not. \par
He paced the room, just admiring, like they were trippy sculptures at some modern art museum. He couldn't fully understand them. It wasn't like with Ignition or Burning—this Law, whatever it was, felt too far away. He could kind of-ish see how it manifested in the world, but he felt that wasn't enough to claim a Law. You had to find it within yourself too. \par
He'd known Ignition. Every time he fought, he ignited. And his Chains were Prometheus Chains: they were made to carry fire. But he didn't wield a sword or an axe. He had no sense of Sharpness. This must have something to do with cutting, but it just wasn't his style. It was somewhat frustrating seeing it right there but missing what he needed to grasp it.Unauthorized use of content: if you find this story on Amazon, report the violation.\par
Maybe if he got something to do with cutting in the future, he could come back to this. He made a note of it. \par
*** \par
He met back up with Reina at the entrance. “You ready?” she said.\par
“Yes,” he said.\par
That was it. No fuss, no frills with her. They were off.\par
There was a ladder near the back of the warehouse, stretching all the way to the ceiling and beyond. She threw her buffs on him—among them, her new skill, Essence Cloak, which dampened the effects essence of based attacks. He had a feeling it would come in handy very soon. \par
He went first.\par
They climbed fifty feet up rusted, clattering steel toward a square of black. Every so often it flickered blue-white, like lightning flickering the night. The closer they got, the more they heard this deep-throated humming, like generators working overtime.\par
This place must have housed the electricals once; exposed wiring decorated the walls, made up the ceiling. The ground was all steel and run over with thick black cables. It was humid and dingy and dark as hell. \par
There was just one source of light in the room, and it was the boss. A metal eldritch monstrosity. Its main body looked like one of those old-timey computers, whirring with gears, strung up with coiled wires and flashing lights. Four thick steel cables snaked out from it, sizzling with blue-white electricity, and they were what caught Zane's attention. They went on and on, looping around themselves, hugging its body. They took up a huge chunk of the room.\par
\par
Lightning Kraken (Monster)\par
Essence Level 48\par
 \par
 Electrified Aura (Passive) [Uncommon]\par
The Kraken immerses itself in a field of crackling electricity. Any physical contact results in electrical shock, punishing melee attacks. This aura intermittently discharges, electrifying nearby metal surfaces. \par
 \par
Lightning Lash (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Channels the electrical energy into a focused, whip-like lash of lightning, striking at enemies from a distance.\par
\par
That ‘Electrified Aura’… oh, that would be a bitch.\par
Its weakness lit up red—its main body. To get to it, though, you'd have to get past those cable tentacle things. \par
The Kraken turned to face him as Reina nimbly hopped through. He nodded to her; she nodded back. And he charged.\par
As soon as he got up within twenty feet of it he felt static shocks rippling up his body. Reina threw up a shield as he ran, but it still stung. He lashed out at it with a Chain. It tried blocking with its cable tentacles, but it couldn't—his Chains were just too heavy. The tentacles collapsed right under.\par
But the beast was gone before his Chains could catch it. He’d blinked, and it’d vanished. How could something so big just be gone?\par
He heard Reina cry out—too late. He turned; he deduced what was happening, threw up his Chains—it still wasn't fast enough. The Lightning Lash ripped a molten line down his chest, and his body went rigid, spasming.\par
It was lucky his Chains could move on their own. The thing tried yanking him in, but he crushed the cords that held him. He wriggled out, panting, twitching all over, but free.\par
\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
\par
Shit that thing’s fast. Maybe he should have seen it coming, lightning and all. This time he prowled after it, but he kept his Chains close in a defensive posture. It blinked here and there, back and forth. He could barely keep up. It probed him with Lashes; he fended them off one by one—\par
Then a coil slipped right through his web of parries and lashed him in the chest. And he went down, spasming again, cursing. It kept hold of him, pouring its power into him. It took a tremendous effort to ward that cable away. Then—\par
\par
Warning: Health under 50\%!\par
\par
Every time it got hold of him, a massive chunk of his health instantly vanished. It was ridiculous. At least now,\par
\par
Savage Body activated!\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par

\par
He stopped probing for it. He just stood there panting. It was just too fast, and it had him on the defensive. If he kept on like this, it’d whittle him down to nothing. He needed something—a trick to crack it open.\par
It blinked back and forth, slowly drawing closer…\par
"It's going to hit me," he said aloud, not taking his eyes off the thing. \par
"Stop shielding. When it does, I need you to pour as much essence as you can into the healing spells, just keep healing me. Heal me till you're out. Got it?"\par
"Understood!" said Reina. \par
This time he saw the lash coming. \par
This time, he threw out his Chains. And dove to meet it. \par
It liked hitting him in the chest. Made sense—big target. So he put his hands right about there, and the chain slapped him right between his arms. He hissed; his whole body contracted at once. Including his arms, which firmed a vice grip around that damned cable. \par
Yes! \par
The Kraken seemed confused. Why did he want to eat damage? Until it saw his Chains arching for its main body. It tried throwing cables at it but they were too small, too light. It tried yanking out the tentacle but he had it clamped tight. \par
\par
Warning! Health under 75\%!\par

\par
He’d taken a page out of the Mechanical Sentinel’s book. If you couldn’t grab hold of it, grab hold of what it was attached to. And now the Kraken couldn’t run! His Chains made a noose around the base of the tentacle, right where it was attached to the body. And burned. \par
The Kraken had no mouth, but by how it moved he could tell it was suffering. It poured in more power— \par
\par

\par
He squeezed harder, letting that noose, white with seething Law, saw straight through the joint. \par
This thing had no Law. His attack did. You had to fight it on even grounds; only Laws could fight Laws. Without them… \par
He could sense this thing was made of tough stuff. If he tried strangling it normally he’d get nowhere. He certainly couldn’t dent it with his fists. But once he’d locked his Chains tight, once he’d poured that fire in, the steel had no choice but to melt. The Universe commanded it to. \par
\par
Warning! Health under 25\%! \par
\par
At almost the same time, the tentacle sloughed off the beast. \par
\par


\section{19. Lightning Kraken}
\par
His heart was thumping wild, his head throbbing with the heat of the fight, but he flowed with it. He didn't let it get to him. Fight wasn't over. Even now the Kraken was reeling back, trying to pull away—but he was one step ahead. While his left Chain cut off a tentacle, his right wrapped around the base of another. \par
He had less than a quarter of his health left. Reina was pouring in all the healing she could, but she looked pale, sweating hard; she was closely tapped out. If that thing got another tentacle on him, it was over.\par
Neat thing was, he had physics on his side now. \par
You could balance pretty well on four limbs. You could balance decently well on three. But Zane had one limb clamped tight—which left the Kraken with only two.\par
So when it tried throwing a lightning lash at him, he didn't even bother dodging. He just shoved with his chains, and it went careening off balance; the lash went wide, sizzling a steaming black line into the wall.\par
He called the Laws of Ignition to the edges of his chains, and commanded them to burn.\par
It flailed like a dying insect. But whenever it tried lashing at him, he just should knocked it hard off balance and kept on burning.\par
Still, just standing in his presence hurt. Literally. That electric field kept grinding him down, shooting painful jolts of electricity through his body. It felt like getting hundreds of the worst static shocks he’d ever, over and over. Soon—\par
\par
Warning: Critical Health!\par
Savage Body activated!\par

\par
He was just wondering if he should let go, if he should start getting worried, when something warm hit him in the back.\par
\par
You have been affected by Healing Touch!\par
Health restored 20\%\par
\par
Just in time.\par
So long as Reina kept fending off that electric effect, he had this.\par
Another arm fell. Already, he was working on the third. The Kraken was really thrashing now, getting desperate, and that familiar heat ran hotter in his chest, lighting his face, making him smile.\par
He doubted he could’ve done this on his own. Hit for hit, that thing would have fried him. He still strongly preferred taking things solo. Simpler, easier, more fun. \par
But for bosses outside his range like this one, maybe a competent teammate wasn't so bad—every once in a while. Reina did exactly what she needed to do, at exactly the right time, every time. He'd trained with fighters. He’d seen how often they froze up, second-guessed themselves, made dumb mistakes. It was rare to find someone who just got it done, someone he could trust. \par
The Kraken must have sensed the end, because its next shot was aimed so wide he didn't even bother blocking it.\par
It took him about a half second to realize that wasn't an accident. \par
And in that half second, the Lash went straight for Reina. Zane’s heart sank. \par
She cried out, throwing up a shield. It lasted just a moment—\par
—Just enough time for Zane to get there, and throw his body in front of the Lash.\par
He went down hard; his world went black for a second; dimly, he felt himself spasming, hissing. \par
\par
Warning: Critical health!\par
\par
Come on, he screamed at himself, come on!\par
He had to get it off him. With the last of his will he wrenched his Chains down and smashed the cable from his body.\par
"Oh my God," breathed Reina. He dimly registered you as shaking him. “No, no! Get up, c’mon. Get up, you can do this!”\par
Panting, groaning, he propped himself up to an elbow. \par
He could see a flash out of the corner of his eye—another Lightning Lash, but this time he had two chains back, and he sent it careening into the wall. \par
"Fuck," he groaned, and got up to his knee. \par
"Okay,” he rasped, “It has just two tentacles left. It can't move and throw at the same time. I have two Chains too. So long as I play defense, I can keep us safe. I can recover. Just stay put."\par
She nodded, and he focused on breathing and clearing that horrible buzzing feeling out of his arms, his legs, his head. Every few seconds, he would shiver with a phantom shock. The cracking kept throwing, but he was right—he could fend it off like this. \par
He felt Reina staring at him. If you encounter this tale on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
"What?" he said.\par
"You came back for me," she said softly. “You… saved me.” \par
"Yeah," he grunted, still tracking the Kraken's limbs. \par
A terse silence. \par
"You said you wouldn't," she said. She was wide-eyed. "You could’ve finished it off if you didn’t. Why—"\par
"I don't know. Dumb decision. I regret it already. Shut up, heal me, and let me focus on tracking this thing."\par
She did, thankfully. Soon she gathered enough essence to throw another spell on him.\par
\par
You have been afflicted by Healing Touch! \par
Health increased 20\%\par
\par
It took another quarter of an hour of this strange stalemate until he was nearly full health again. \par
"Alright," he said. "I'm going for it. Stay behind me. If it shoots for you, I'll knock it off course. Got it?"\par
"Got it," said Reina.\par
They marched toward the Kraken. It wasn't so lightning quick now that it only had two legs to burst off of; it could barely balance itself. It tried lashing at him, at her, but he fended it off with careful precision. At last, he managed to wrap a chain around a tentacle, yanked it in, wrapped the other around the base. And the Kraken could do little more than watch as he burned off the limb. \par
The last tentacle came easiest of all. Then the Kraken was just a dead slab of wired steel. He wrapped all his chains around it, one by one, until he couldn't see a single glowing dial anymore. And set it all ablaze at once. The room went piercing white, so bright they had to shield their eyes. A hot blast matted their clothes to their bodies. Then— \par

"Good work," he said to Reina. \par
"Mhm," she said. She seemed dazed, a little out of it. \par
\par
***\par
\par
When they climbed down, they were surrounded by what Zane started to think of as Reina's fan club. He realized you could split the warehouse workers into two distinct groups—one mostly of older men and women, who deferred to, respected, and listened to Reina, but didn't worship her. \par
Then there as another group—mostly young men—who seemed ready to drink her bathwater. \par
They were all very concerned with whether she was hurt. After that fussing was over, Zane said, "I plan on claiming this place for my faction. You're cool with that?"\par
"What faction?" said Reina.\par
Zane made a face. "I come from a group up north... I'm not really leader. But I am, kind of. It’s hard to explain. Anyway, you're probably strong enough to survive on your own."\par
The snaring thickets people clearly needed help, but Rayna was probably the most competent person he'd met since he came here. They'd be fine under her.\par
"Just keep out of any E-ranked dungeons. You'll be good. You can stay on this land as long as you like. Or clear an F-rank dungeon of your own. For you, a weaker one shouldn't be too hard."\par
She shook her head. "I want to follow you."\par
Huh. "Why?"\par
"You're strong," she said, shrugging. "And… I like you. I think you have what it takes."\par
For some reason her lackeys seemed scandalized, but Zane couldn't argue with her logic. Sensible and direct—it seemed her style. \par
"Fair."\par
The others grumbled a little but where Reina went, they went.\par
\par
*** \par
\par
They marched up north to claim the Beacon there. And with it, the dungeon chest dropped.\par
The chest looked like any other dungeon chest on the outside. But open it up, and the inside went much deeper. It had double the amount of essence stones an F-rank dungeon chest, at a ballpark glance. But there was something else there too—\par
It looked like a pomegranate, but so white it was almost clear.\par
\par
Law Fruit (F)\par
Magnifies one's insights into the Laws of the Universe. Pairs best with meditation on an object of Law insight. Most effective for Minor Laws. At F-rank this effect tapers strongly at Major, and is essentially useless for Laws above Elemental. Still, it is invaluable to the beginner. \par
\par
So there’s an Elemental after Major? And more than one rank above it? Huh. \par
“I'll pocket this one," he said.\par
That got some grumbles from the fan club. "Shouldn't we divide it among all of us? Isn't that fair?" said one.\par
Zane dropped the Fruit in his pocket. "If you want something," he said, “Earn it. I killed two bosses and freed all of you. What have you done?”\par
The man spluttered.\par
"By the way," said Zane casually, “This is the last time I justify myself to any of you. If you have a problem with that, get stronger. Make yourself matter. Make me pay attention. Like Reina here."\par
Reina blushed. No one else had anything to say to that. He was pretty sure he hadn’t won many friends with that little statement. It was a good thing he’d recused himself from leadership. He had no interest in winning a popularity contest. Probably couldn’t win one if he tried. \par
"All right," he said. "We're going north to meet up with the others. We'll have strength in numbers then, and they've got a head start making a settlement. We can join them.” \par
He gestured. "We'll need to haul that chest with us."\par
They seemed reluctant to listen to him, but got on it when Reina commanded them. \par
For a bunch of people who've made their livelihoods hauling weight, they proved shockingly bad at moving the chest. Eventually, he had to snatch it with his Chains and lug it himself—he barely felt it. They looked at him like he was performing a miracle.\par
\par
***\par
\par
It was evening when Zane came back to the Luminous Forest Safe Zone. He found the start of a bustling town. When he was a kid, his science class had kept a do-it-yourself ant colony. They'd been very hands-off with it, but the ants started naturally making their own tunnels, building their own nests, and within a week, they'd carved out a whole civilization all on their own. This kind of felt like that.\par
You left them alone a day, and they got a row of basic stone huts set up, ranged in a square. Roofless, sure, but they were standing. And at the center, planks and scaffolding framed the idea of a town hall. Around it all were steel stakes driven into the ground where one might put up a fence. Nothing particularly impressive or complex, but it was a lot more than he'd expected.\par
Most of the people were huddled in the middle of the square of houses— the town square, he supposed—where a few of them had taken to being cooks. They must have traded in for the food at the beacon. They had slabs of meat and fish grilling over fires, fires burning atop the gnarled wood of the Forest. They weren’t just meat and fish. As they got closer, he could see the essence steaming off them. Was all food traded from the Beacon rich with essence?\par
Most of them stood when they saw him coming. A few even saluted him. He waved them off. "Sit down," he said, “Keep eating, pretend I'm not even here—ah, right. These,"—he gestured behind him—"are more stragglers I picked up. We can spare some food, right?"\par
“Oh, hey, man! Welcome back! Sure—of course,” said Cale, grinning, waving from around one of the fires.\par
Zane turned to Reina and the rest. "You hungry?"\par
\par
*** \par
\par
There were just a few dozen of them spread out among the fires, eating slightly overcooked essence-soaked meat, mostly in silence. There was no laughter, really, but everywhere Zane looked, he saw calm faces. Relaxed faces. It must have been the first night in a week that any of them had truly felt safe. \par
\par


\section{20. Others (I) }
\par
After, he introduced Reina to the rest, and the rest to Reina. Reina had been warehouse manager, and she had a natural skill for working with people—she was the kind of person people wanted to follow, wanted to listen to. Cale was the kind of person people wanted to like.\par
So he made them both co-leaders of his little settlement, and had them sort out who took what. It was decided Cale would deal with people management stuff. Sorting people into roles that best suited them, running the community. Reina would take most of the logistics of settlement building, including training. Eventually she wanted to lead a militia. She wanted to protect her people, make a safe home for them. For that, it was made very clear to her that she needed power. \par
It was probably why she joined him in the first place. \par
Other than a few Reina fanboys, folk seemed happy with him. Maybe a little too happy—a few insisted on calling him ‘Sir,’ or ‘Chief’ or ‘Boss.’ Last night he’d had people of all ages and occupations—bankers to fishermen, teachers to children—coming up, telling him how grateful they were, and so on. Which was rather awkward for him, since he’d never really meant to save them in the first place. He liked clearing dungeons. They just happened to be there. \par
But they were here now. Oh, well. \par
The folk that actually spoke to him were a minority, though. A little more than a dozen. A huge chunk stared at him with... reverence, almost? He thought they might come talk to him, but they never did. They seemed scared. He wondered if he came off as unapproachable. If so, he was pleasantly surprised.\par
They were adapting well, at least. In the past week, reality had sunk in for most of them. There was no contacting anyone from their past life. Their past life was literally wiped away. They still had friends and family they cared about and wanted to see—but to do that, they first had to survive.\par
When he spoke to the folk—or rather, when they spoke at him—he got a sense of resignation. They seemed a little droopy, a little shattered. But also resolved, now. They knew they were here for the long haul. They had to make the best of it.\par
It turned out a few of the teens he'd met in Luminous Forest had gotten separated from their parents, who worked in the warehouse. Late last night, he saw several tearful reunions. That did make him smile. \par
They made him a cabin, end of a row, biggest of the bunch. Still nothing impressive—the inside was sparse, almost empty—but they’d gotten some cloth and feathers out of the Beacon to make a bed. They’d set up a boulder as the chair, and a tree stump as a table. Neat gesture.\par
Some time late last night, all that talking tired him out. So he took one last trout and ambled off to bed. Essence spilled into his mouth, warmed his chest as he wolfed it down. Maybe half as much as a Moon Fruit. It didn't do much for him now, but it was more pleasant to eat than the raw thing. That night he slept very well. \par
\par
***\par
\par
The next morning he made the rounds, checking up on what everyone from his old camp was up to. Liam, the pre-med, had chosen a Priest class. He wanted to be a healer. The techies, Raj and Diana, Annie’s mother, went for Mage. Most of the warehouse workers, who were a little higher level, had already chosen Warrior or Ranger; they were set to be militia and builders. The Snaring Thickets people spec’d into Priests and Rogues mostly. They would work as scouts and healers. \par
He was surprised how much everyone bought in. There was hardly a person lazing about, sitting still. Then again, it was made very clear the apocalypse was no time to sit still. He saw folk bustling about, heating pots, lugging around chunks of stone, planting stakes, drilling Skills in a nearby clearing. They took his words to heart. He was pleased to see it.\par
As he walked through the camp—he still had to tell people to stop saluting or bowing as he passed—he came across Annie. Yet another surprise: she was Level 6 now, and she'd become a Warrior. Her progress was shockingly fast. She said she'd been binging food and essence all day; she was growing like a weed. Since Zane was a Warrior, she chose it too. She wanted to be strong just like him, she said. "Sure, kid," he chuckled.\par
Brad and his gang were put in a cell they quickly slapped together. Sophie wanted to join the healers, but Reina made her be a scout. Reina was very reasonable most of the time, but she had a special dislike for Sophie for no reason he could make out. \par
Before he left, he gathered them all in the square. There must have been nearly fifty of them now. The air was chill, dappled with early morning mist, and the rising sun painted them orange.\par
“Let's make one thing clear,” he said. “I should be your last resort. You'll likely face Monsters again, or other threats. But I won't be around to help—I'll spend most of my time outside, in dungeons. Which means you'll need to govern yourselves. Fend for yourselves. I'll step in if disaster strikes, but you’ve got to be strong on your own. Got it?”A case of content theft: this narrative is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\par
They nodded. There was a chorus of “yeah”s and “yes, Sir!”s. He wondered too how they had taken to his authority so easily. Maybe in disasters, people needed someone strong to look to. Maybe it was just his Level.\par
“Good,” he said. “I'll be back around sundown. More will probably be joining us soon. Let's get those shelters going.”\par
He turned and left.\par
\par
***\par
\par
You have entered: Dungeon: Whispering Caves (F).\par
\par
The Whispering Caves were due east of the Luminous Forest, built into a chunk of mountain range which rose up into the Cascades. The trees grew sparse, and up came cliffs of stone.\par
Caves there led into a mess of dimly lit, echoey tunnels. Its walls were matted with glowing red fungi. The monsters here looked like something out of a cheap haunted house, these withered spirit-things draped in tattered black; “Dread Wraiths,” they were called. They kept rushing at him, but most were under Level 20, and weak besides. He still passed some X's on his mini-map, though. People died here? Maybe they were frightened into tripping and hitting their head. \par
The boss was a little more interesting.\par
It was called an Echo Wraith. And its lair was a perfect sphere of a cavern. The boss could bounce sound off it to make you think it was everywhere and nowhere at once, and the air was so smoky it had a great deal of cover. Zane ran after it for maybe half a minute, got bored, and blanketed the place with a flaming Chain Cyclone. That was the end of that.\par
\par
Dungeon cleared!\par
\par
He found five spelunkers cowering in one of the tunnels. He sent them to his people.\par
***\par
\par
You have entered: Dungeon: Sunken Grove (F)\par
\par
The Sunken Grove was due north of the Luminous Forest. It was underground, interestingly—you thought you were walking on a carpet of leaves at first, but you fell through. That carpet was actually a canopy. Underneath, there was a quaint little forest riddled with underground rivers. Three different bosses were spread across it. \par
One was called ‘Twilight Wolf’—a beast that looked much scarier than it fought. There was this ent-thing, which his fires quickly disposed of. Most interesting was the final boss, the Grove Hydra, which commanded its own miniature swamp.\par
This one, at least, gave him a few minutes of fighting. When he threw his fire at it, it sent up waves of muddy water, blunting the blow. It had minions under the surface, constantly dragging at him, yanking him off balance. And it spewed poison mists that got in his eyes, screwing with his aim. But in the end he got hold of it, pulled it close, clamped in a tight noose, and poured until essence he melted the thing to slag.\par
He got a Level out of it. He also found about a dozen more stragglers and sent them to camp.\par
\par
*** \par
\par
Several weeks passed like this. \par
He was starting to get bored of these F-ranks. He needed stronger stuff. He was doing this wrong. He didn't need to clear out every dungeon near him. He should be looking at where the higher-tier dungeons were—the E- and even D-ranks, maybe—and charting paths to take to get to them. The nearest D-rank was somewhere in the mountains; there were twelve F-ranks between him and that one. Too far. But the nearest E-rank dungeon was just three F-ranks away.\par
Every few days it was like he came home to a new village. They’d started straight out of the Stone Age. They skipped a few centuries with each iteration. The village he saw now was nearly medieval. \par
A few of the folk he'd set back on the third day worked in construction. On day five, he came back to houses with thatched roofs and the beginnings of paved roads. They'd gotten these essence lamp-posts out of the beacon, so they didn't need to burn fires all night.\par
The town was expanding, adding a new district, and there was talk of building an outpost in former goblin territory too. Things were going well, and quickly. He'd made it clear he wasn't their leader. But for some reason he still felt an odd sense of pride.\par
Finally, he managed to clear a path to an E-rank dungeon. He planned on going alone, but when Reina heard, she insisted on tagging along. She said she wanted to stretch her legs. Unlike most people he teamed up with in his past life, she got that he preferred silence to small talk, that he liked things direct. And she knew what she was doing, so he didn't mind.\par
She’d done wonders with the settlement so far—she worked harder than anyone. She was very diligent about it, too—every night, she insisted they eat dinner together alone. She said this was so she could fill him in on the goings-on of the day. She got very annoyed when anyone interrupted them, even to pass a message.\par
Together, they crossed what must have been near fifty miles of forest dungeon, and arrived at last at—\par
\par
You have entered E-ranked Dungeon: Ravenwood Village.\par
Clearance Objective:\par
Slay the Hollowed Reaper\par
Slay the Forgotten Guardian\par
Objectives: 0/2 met\par
\par
It was noon when they came. But it was like the dungeon had its own atmosphere; the moment they stepped through, they looked up and saw skies so thick with dark gray clouds it seemed about to rain.\par
The forest cleared up, flattened out. They stumbled into a a ghost town. The buildings were all crumbling shambles of stone and wood. The windows were shattered; chilling gales swept through them, scouring their insides clean, screaming all the while. The gravel streets twisted about with no discernible logic. They passed a field of withered, blackened stalks which swayed gently in the gloom. It was as though this place had been abandoned years ago… \par
Just then—\par
\par
Forgotten Guardian has been slain! \par

Wait… what? \par
\par


\section{21. Others (II) }
\par
It could only mean one thing: there were other people here. And they were strong.\par
He turned to Reina. But before he could get out a word, he saw a darkness rising over her shoulder. He whirled around. It was rising all around them—the dead, withered corn stalks, crackling and snapping to life, kicking up plumes of dust.\par
Something was coming. \par
"Get back," said Zane, eyes narrowed.\par
Hurricane winds gushed over them, spun around them, howling louder and louder, so fast you could see their silver scything currents. They touched down in the middle of the dead field, not ten yards away. They dispersed as fast as they came.\par
They left behind a ghostly creature. Pale, translucent skin reached out from under the hood of a billowing black cloak. In its narrow little hands was a scythe so huge it dwarfed its wielder. The blade, curved like a crescent moon, gave off a sickly bone-white light.\par
Hollowed Reaper \par
Essence Level 39\par
Skills: \par
Soul Scythe (Active) [Uncommon]\par
All those cut by the Soul Scythe have their Souls temporarily severed from their bodies. The effect is strongly disorientating at best, and fatal at worst.\par
Astral Body (Active) [Uncommon]\par
The Reaper exists between this realm and the next, a being as much soul as it is flesh. It receives 30\% less damage from all physical strikes.\par
It was Level 39?\par
Zane sighed. He had four Levels on the thing. Reina made to buff him, but he held up a hand. \par
"Let me have my fun," he said.\par
He was off before she could reply, sprinting forward, Chains whipping through the air. It screeched and leapt for him too. The scythe flashed down. His Chain snapped up, snapped around the sickle blade. There was a shower of sparks, but it held. It looped once, twice, snaking around the handle. The Reaper tried yanking it out. It felt like a child tugging at his arm.\par
Then Zane set his other Chain on fire, and lashed it. White flame took eagerly to black cloak. The flames settled in, pouring over into the skin, and the Reaper's body flaked like burnt paper; there was a piercing hissing, like fat melting. \par
He frowned at it as it thrashed, still struggling to get its only weapon free, and failing utterly. He was realizing he shouldn't have disarmed it so early. It might’ve put up a more interesting fight. As it was, this was pretty pathetic.\par
The Reaper let go of its scythe. By then, Zane had snagged it round one leg. He had his bite—he'd sunk it in. Now there was just the drowning, the dragging deep underwater. He imagined that was what it must have felt like as his Chains made one loop after another up the legs, up the chest, round the head, until it was one struggling mass of black. At Level 43, his Chains had gotten so heavy he had to take special care in summoning them. Back at base camp, the shockwave from a careless summon had collapsed a row of nearby huts. Now all that weight bore down on the Reaper's body, cased it in a steel coffin. Only its little desperate quivers let you know there was anything in there at all.\par
These past few days—especially as this Chain Mastery got to tier II—he felt like a different fighter. The Zane of a week ago would have struggled to catch it, to bind it so easily. The stronger he got, the slower he leveled, but he was still improving at a rate that shocked even himself. It wasn’t just his power that grew. He was far more comfortable using it.\par
He sat his Chain tomb aflame.\par
The Monster held out twenty-odd seconds. Longer than he'd expected. But the Chains squeezed in farther and farther as the solids within changed forms, sloshed out the bottom or poured up in bleak smoke. Soon his Chains clutched nothing. He unwound them and saw a heap of white ash.\par
Hollowed Reaper has been slain! \par
Objectives met: 2/2\par
E-rank Dungeon Ravenwood Village has been cleared!\par
That was mildly amusing, he supposed.\par
Clapping rang out from the other side of the field. He blinked. There was a group of four people standing there, watching him. No-one he knew. One look and he could tell they weren’t from here. They carried themselves unlike any of his survivors. \par
One was a petite woman, blue-eyed, with hair so light blonde it was nearly white.\par
Elaine Thompson (Creature)\par
Essence Level 29 \par
Class: Snow Mage \par
Faction: Knights of Cascadia\par
Beside her stood a tall, thin, bespectacled man. He had warm brown eyes, soft curls, and an easy smile.\par
Caden Green (Creature)\par
Essence Level 31 \par
Class: Mystic Healer\par
Faction: Knights of Cascadia\par
Next to him was the girl, almost as tall, with a lithe dancer's body clad in dark tights. Her black hair was cut in bangs.\par
Kyra Ellison (Creature)\par
Essence Level 32 \par
Class: Shadow Rogue\par
Faction: Knights of Cascadia\par
And last, the clapping man. Big, burly, and with an impressive gray beard flecked with white—one look at him, and you could tell he had old man strength, dad strength. He was well over six feet, nearly as tall as Zane stood now, and just about as muscled. He had a big old potbelly and a friendly smile.Unauthorized usage: this narrative is on Amazon without the author's consent. Report any sightings.\par

Faction: Knights of Cascadia\par
"Bravo, bravo! Great stuff," Tom chuckled. "You’re the man we're looking for, aren't you?"\par
“That depends,” said Zane. “Who are you looking for?” \par
Tom frowned at him. "Luminous Faction," he muttered. “Huh. My bad. Seems I went and made a silly assumption. Unless... You're not the Mad Dog, are you?"\par
"No," said Zane.\par
These people didn't seem aggressive. They hadn’t summoned any weapons, but he still kept alert. \par
“The name’s Zane," he said.\par
"Well, Zane," said Tom. "It’s lovely meeting you. Yeah. I had a hunch something was off. Level seemed in the right ballpark, but no one told me the Mad Dog was a Signed.”\par
“Signed?”\par
"Your Title," said Tom. "It's a Signature Title, isn't it? It shows up on Identify. ‘Savage Sage’.”\par
"Yeah," said Zane, blinking. "Didn't know there was a name for it."\par
“Well, there isn’t an official one. There isn’t an official anything anymore. It's just what folks around here are calling folk like you. There aren't many running around. In this chunk of the world, there’s… two? Right?" He looked to his buddies. The tall, dark girl shrugged. The petite blonde girl—Elaine—nodded. "In the Pacific Northwest, we only know about Zhang and Blackwell. And now you."\par
“And who are those?” said Reina.\par
“That’s their given names. You might know them as ‘Joker Savant’ and ‘The Soldier of God’,” said Tom. At their blank looks—“Nevermind. Zhang’s unaffiliated. Blackwell leads the Iron Legion up in Seattle. They've been at each other's throats all last week. The Seattle folk keep trying to wipe her out, but they can't. It's what slowed down their clearing lately, if you were wondering. So—who are you guys? You guys with the Mad Dogs? Allies or something? Sub-factions?”\par
"There's a misunderstanding here," said Zane. "We haven't met any other Factions since this all started."\par
They seem surprised. “You guys never upgraded your Beacon?"\par
"Not yet," said Zane. It always seemed they had more urgent uses for the stones like training their people, or trading for food.\par
"You should really get on that," said Tom, nodding sagely. "You wouldn’t believe how much there is to learn. A Rank E Beacon can only get you as far as Washington state, maybe a little north, a little south. But even there, folks have figured stuff out that would’ve taken the rest of us years.” \par
"Noted," said Zane.\par
“Nowadays, you’ve got to know what's going on,” said Tom amiably.\par
"What is going on?" Reina piped up.\par
Tom considered her, then him, like he was wondering how much to reveal. Then he shrugged, "Well, what do you want to know?”\par
"What’s happening out there?” said Reina suddenly. “In the rest of the world."\par
“So we set out from headquarters just three days ago," said Tom. "You look at the map—we’re that yellow cluster up in the north Cascades. I'm out here to do a... scouting mission? Diplomacy?” He scratched his head, looking at the others. They shrugged. “We've been in contact with the Mad Dogs, see, we're trying to get the measure of them... anyway. Sorry. What I mean to say is, we've been gone three whole days. So my knowledge is old. Stuff’s changing real fast, so keep that in mind. Here's what I know.”\par
"In America, the East Coast’s maybe a quarter cleared. Midwest is pretty much a wasteland. Florida, same case, except for a few major cities. On the West Coast, Southern California is more clear than Northern California. Go up farther, where we are, I mean...."\par
He gestured around them. "It's pretty much Mad Max. Now, in terms of the world..." He chewed his lips. "That I'm not as sure on.”\par
He turned to his friends. “You guys have a clue?"\par
"I think so," said Caden, the thin bespectacled man. "I got some intel from Seattle before we left. Most of what we know outside is swaps with Seattle—that is, the Iron Legion, with their D-rank Beacon. Theirs has a strong enough signal to talk to California and half the Midwest. The D-rank Beacons in the Midwest there can reach the East Coast, and so on. So, caveat: this is all one long game of telephone. But what we think we know is this.” \par
"Canada's in a similar state to the US. Similar to most of the world, actually. Still mostly overrun. But the African continent’s just about half cleared, same with China. Russia's half cleared by dungeon number but not by land mass. They've all managed this because powerhouse factions emerged, each led by a very strong Signed. Our best intel says some of the Chinese are in the high 60s, Level-wise, and there’s a Nigerian in the 70s. They've all gotten their third class. That much we know for sure. There's also a rumor a Russian Signed cleared a D-ranked dungeon on her own. Personally, I don't believe it. But that’s what they say.” \par
Zane found this all incredibly fascinating. He thought he was fast—he was leveling pretty much all day. How the hell did they all get so strong? I might not even be the strongest in Washington state.\par
It was surprising. And also exciting. \par
Then again, he supposed it was the population of the whole world they were talking about. Everyone who was competing in thousands of different professions before were now competing in only one. Leveling. Maybe it shouldn't have been surprising some true monsters showed up.\par
"Again," said Caden, "I should preface—it's hardly been a month. We're still very, very early. And the vast majorities of dungeons are F- and E- rank—they're far easier to clear. D- and C- ranked dungeons seem to be at least a tier above them, in terms of difficulty. And they have at least two levels, whereas F- and E- ranks are all surface. It'll be a while before those are all cleared. And B- and A- rank… well.” \par
He shook his head. "We should be thankful the only S- rank dungeons we know of are Everest and the Marianas Trench—where no one lives, pretty much. Even if they dungeon break, most of us’ll be fine.” \par
"Dungeon break?"\par
Tom blinked at him. "Wow. Yeah, you really need to get on that Beacon upgrading! If a dungeon's left to its own devices long enough, monsters start crawling out of them. Not the bosses, far as we know—just the minions they spawn, but those are nasty enough. They can even wander into Safe Zones. Some F-rank dungeons are already starting to leak. Seems like the higher the grade, the longer it takes to start leaking, though. E-ranks still seem to be safe. For now.” \par
Zane soaked that all in in silence. Finally, he asked, “So, are most people out there..." he gestured to them, “…about the same Level as you?” \par
Tom let out a booming laugh. "Oh, God no! Most folks are still sub-ten. We're the elected Faction representatives—we're out here to meet up with the Mad Dogs. We’re here to show a strong face. We've been going back and forth on Beacon messages, and they're... well. They're pretty much what you would expect for a gang that names itself the Mad Dogs. Still, always good to try to smooth things over. They're looking to be the power in Southern Washington, and they’re growing real fast. Wouldn’t want to rub them wrong.” \par
"Hold on," said Zane. He'd seen a long strip of yellow lining the western coast. Just a handful of F- and E- ranked dungeons stood between that territory and the Luminous Faction. He hadn't thought much of it until now. “That strip near the sea. That's them?”\par
“Yep," said Tom. "Look. You seem a nice enough guy, so word of advice. We Cascades folk, we don't want trouble. We're chatting with nearby factions, trying to make friends, that sort of thing. Well, this nice little faction we were talking to, the Clamshell Guard—just a little West of where we are now—suddenly stopped responding. When we checked, they were gone. That was three days ago. So... be careful, is what I'm saying.”\par
“…Got it,” said Zane.\par
“Why are you telling us all this?” said Reina.\par
“Take it as a gesture of goodwill,” said Tom. “It's like I said. We don't want trouble. If we can all be good neighbors, support each other when we need. That's all I want. My wife, my daughters, they're still with us in the mountains. Last thing we need right now is a fight. You don't step on our toes, we don't step on yours. Everyone's happy.”\par
“I can agree to that,” said Zane.\par
"Great," said Tom brightly.\par
Tom gave up any claim to the Ravenwood dungeon chest. He called it another gesture of goodwill—they weren’t here bounty hunting anyways. They left off on good terms. Zane was silent the whole way back. There was much to think about. \par
\par


\section{22. Mad Dog (I) }
\par
The first thing Zane did when he got back was upgrade the Beacon.\par
The second thing was to have Reina ramp up the training. From now on, all unused essence stones went to the militia. He dedicated a chestful of stones to setting up stakes, walls, and ditches.\par
Whoever these Mad Dogs were, he was not taking chances.\par
A few days later, he got his first messages on the Beacon. When he checked, a notification popped up—\par
 Hey, this is Tom. Great meeting you, man. \par
Just a heads up. We couldn't come to terms with the Mad Dogs. They don't want just their corner. They want the whole state, and they want us under them. That, or they take us over.\par
I hear they used to be a small-time gang down by the docks before all this. Street corner meth dealers, that kind of thing. The Change gave them real power. It's gone straight to their heads, if you ask me. \par
We tried negotiating, but their leader, the Mad Dog, he's a real piece of work. He wouldn’t have it. If I were you, I'd start thinking about what to do. Because they'll come for you too, sooner or later. That I can pretty much guarantee. Fighting them seems rough—they've got a hell of a force. But bending the knee... to me, it's not an option. Frankly, they’re barbarians. Their ‘top dogs’ get their pick of the women, and the captured men …I saw a fair number of slaves walking around camp. If you want my advice, head north. Get out of there. If you guys need a place to stay while you find a new base, we'd be glad to have you.\par
Your friends, \par
The Knights of Cascadia\par
Zane had already gotten started on the defenses. As for running…\par
He'd run if he had to, sure. But he was never one for running. Running only got you so far. If these folk were as aggressive as Tom claimed, they'd face up sooner or later.\par
And it just irked him. Running, instead of fighting. \par
He'd get a look at these Mad Dogs first. Then he’d make a decision. So far, all he had to go on was Tom's word. Tom seemed a nice enough guy, but Zane wasn't trusting the future of his people on the word of someone he'd met once. That last bit especially—their being glad to have the Luminous Faction at their camp... could be innocuous, a genuine kind gesture. Could be they had other intentions, just like these ‘Mad Dogs.’\par
Zane had to see for himself.\par
Back at the Beacon, he could see the Mad Dogs' progress on the map. Their territory was still a ways West—there were maybe six or seven F-ranked dungeons between them and the Luminous Faction. Seemed like they were mostly expanding up and down the coast.\par
Still, every day he kept a careful eye on them. He thought about reaching out via Beacon but instantly shot the idea down. It was probably better they didn't get on the Mad Dogs' radar.\par
***\par
Around the end of the third week, a wolf Monster wandered into camp in the dead of night. Zane woke late. He only heard the aftermath. It’d cornered a child, who screamed. Luckily, this happened near the huts—A couple of warriors woke up and took the beast down before it could do any real damage. It was lucky too that the thing was only Level 7.\par
They soon determined the Monster came from an F-ranked dungeon to the southwest. It must have started leaking.\par
Zane meant to clear it first thing in the morning, but Reina had a better idea.\par
"You're always going on about how we should protect ourselves," she said. "It's an F-ranked dungeon. It's nothing serious. Why don't we give our warriors their first field test?"\par
So they set off together at the crack of dawn. A troop of forty-odd warriors, thrown together from a bunch of different dungeons Zane had cleared. Former warehouse workers made up maybe half. There were former electricians, former carpenters, former construction workers, former truckers—a few white-collar jobs too. After integration, some accountants and schoolteachers had discovered a fire they didn't know they had.\par
Their old lives were all in the past. Today, they thought of themselves as warriors of the Luminous Faction.\par
Annie had got up to Level 11 and she was raring to go, but her mother said no. It didn't matter her Level; she was not fighting monsters. The little girl was still fuming when they left.\par
The leaky dungeon was called the Millennium Glade, nestled in a valley riddled with towering ancient white-barked trees. A gentle wash of sunlight poured in through the canopy. Things were lazy here, almost sleepy. There was a gentle breeze, the soft chittering of birds, the fresh smells of damp earth and wildflowers. You could be lulled into forgetting you were in danger.\par
And there was danger. Most came in the form of imps, these tiny green things with spears. They were like goblins' smaller, uglier cousins. They were faster too. A few warriors panicked when the Imps came rushing. But once they downed a few, they started to gain confidence. They started to believe they were really warriors; they could do this. \par
They came across a direwolf of the same species that had wandered into camp and cornered it and killed it as a unit. So far, Zane hadn’t needed to step in at all.\par
He was a little more worried when it came to the boss fights, but they turned out fine too. The first was against a slender woodland sprite called the Thornheart Dryad. It used poison spikes, summoned vines and little sprite minions to mess with the warriors. After half an hour of skirmishing, they managed to whittle it down and end it. Zane only stepped in once, when a warrior got out of line and nearly ate a boulder to the face. \par
By the time they got to the other boss, the Greatwolf, they looked like a real fighting unit. Still green, still prone to gaffes, but much less jittery. Zane never knew what to say to them, but Reina did. She threw in encouragements at all the right times—“Well done,” “Great read, James,” or “Clean work!”—and urged them on with a—"You’ve got this!” or “Come on, just a little more—yes!”—when it seemed they might falter.Unauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.\par
In the end, the mission was a massive success. They cleared an F-ranked dungeon almost entirely on their own. \par
Lunch was a massive celebration. They used the dungeon winnings to buy the most expensive food the Beacon offered, a kind of striped crab that would have been a delicacy at a Michelin star restaurant just three weeks ago. The Beacon gave each crab as much essence as an essence stone. Warriors leveled just by eating. They made a feast of it.\par
***\par
Zane excused himself halfway through. He went northwest. He was on a mission to clear up all the nearby leaking dungeons, starting with a former wildlife sanctuary where the beasts had escaped and mutated. It took most of the rest of the day. One in particular was finicky: a graveyard. There were three bosses there. Go figure, they were all ghosts and ghouls, they were all speed-based and they could all cloak. It wasn’t hard tracking them down and squishing them, just annoying. They couldn't do much to him.\par
It wasn't much fun, and he longed to be on the road again soon. But he still felt satisfied after he cleared out all the nearby dungeons up north. He imagined it was the kind of satisfaction some got after thoroughly cleaning their house. Things just felt nicer.\par
*** \par
The sun was starting to set as he walked back. He was still in a pretty good mood, though he could see dark clouds gathering on the horizon by the sea. There would likely be a storm tonight. The roofs had been replaced now—turned from straw to wood to steel. They'd better be ready.\par
As he climbed down the Highlands, he frowned at his mini-map. There were white dots as usual, marking Luminous Faction folk, but what were those white dots with red in the middle? There was a clump of them gathered right outside the main settlement. There was a clump of white dots too, on the other side, facing them…\par
He stilled.\par
He'd checked the Beacon map this morning. He hadn't seen any signs the Mad Dogs were expanding east! But who else could they be? Then he was sprinting down the plains fast as he could. \par
He came upon the settlement. There was Reina. Her hands were balled to fists, her face twisted in anger. Her warriors milled nervously behind her. \par
Across from her, just twenty paces off, stood a bald man with a puglike face. He was shirtless, exposing a very unimpressive body. His arms were riddled with tattoos. Across his chest, the word MAD DOG was carved into the flesh in gruesome capital letters. \par
Derek Anderson (Creature)\par
Essence Level 29\par
Class: Mauler\par
Behind him was a crew of men just like him, all bald, all with MAD DOG carved into their chests too. It must’ve been cleared every level up—did they re-carve it every time? Zane had hardly met them, and they already seemed ridiculous. \par
“Enough! Leave—now!" snarled Reina. Her fists were clenched so hard they were trembling.\par
"Aww," smirked Derek. “C’mon, baby, don't be like that. Anyone ever tell you you’re beautiful? Tell you what. You come back with me and we’ll let your friends off easy. Think about it, alright?” \par
"What do you think you're doing in my Faction?" said Zane flatly.\par
They finally noticed him. All at once. \par
"Zane!" Reina’s face lit up. “Thank God you're here! They—"\par
"Oh, this is Zane," Derek turned his narrow little gaze on Zane. "Your girl’s told us all about you. You're a big fella, aren't you? And you're—" his eyes widened, twitched. \par
But he was only stunned for a second. Then he barked out a laugh. “Phew! Level 43! Someone's been eating his wheaties.”\par
He wasn’t cowed. Interesting. Zane wondered what gave him the confidence. \par
"Yeah, okay. So you're a big boy, real big,” mocked Derek. "But guess what? We’ve got a guy just as big as you. And he's got an army of Level 30-pluses to back him up!"\par
Ah.\par
The men behind Derek started to bark like hounds. \par
"You think you can take all of us, big boy?"\par
Zane stayed raised a brow. “How strong is this… Mad Dog… precisely?” \par
“He’s got two Levels on you, buddy. And a hundred fighting men willing to die for him!” \par
“Oh,” said Zane. He gathered this was meant to scare him, but all he could think about was how interesting a challenge it sounded. \par
Still—“You should leave,” he told Derek. \par
“I don’t think I will,” said Derek. He must have taken Zane’s words, his calmness, as a surrender. His smile grew smugger. "How about this? We give you three days to clear out. Take all your shit and get the fuck out. Three-day grace period, isn't that nice? After that, well… all’s fair game. Run fast, and who knows? Maybe we won’t catch you.” \par
“How generous,” said Zane dryly.\par
“Isn’t it? We could wipe you now, you know. We won’t! But you’ve gotta give me something for it. I want that one." He pointed straight at Reina.\par
“Go fuck yourself!” screamed Reina. \par
"Oh, I like that!” laughed Derek. “It’s more fun when they have some fight in ‘em.” \par
Reina seemed one insult away from lunging at him.\par
"I'm not going to ask again," said Zane calmly. "Leave."\par
"No," said Derek, smirking.\par
Zane shrugged. Then slowly, methodically, he started walking toward the man.\par
"Oh yeah, that's it," said Derek. “Big boy’s mad. Well guess what, big boy? You touch me and you're done. Your whole village’s done! Mad Dog won't spare a single one of ‘em!"\par
Zane kept walking.\par
“Did you hear me, you stupid oaf? You touch me and we'll raze this shitty little village to the fucking ground!"\par
He was panicking; his voice got higher and higher pitched the closer Zane got. Until Zane stopped right in front of him. Zane staring down at him impassively. Derek swallowed. "Yeah, yeah, that's right—"\par
Zane slapped him so hard his front teeth went flying. \par
He slapped him so hard Derek's whole body went flying, tumbling spinning into the grass.\par
For a second, Derek just lay there, staring dumbly up at him, as though he couldn't believe then Zane really just hit him.\par
It took a half-second for the others to react. Then one huge black Chain whipped through the air, blasting them all off their feet. They went flying, screaming as in Zane crouched down to Derek's level.\par
Derek tried to rise. "You!"— he spat. He looked furious. “You punk! I’ll fucking—”\par
Zane slapped him again. This time, something audibly cracked.\par
But this one didn't break when he went down. Sure he choked out a sob, but he seemed madder if anything. "I'll fucking kill you!" he shrieked, slobbering drool. "I'll kill all of you! Your girl too, I'll break her like a dog! Oh, yeah. Just you wait. Once Mad Dog hears, you're FUCKED!”\par
Zane sighed. He looked to the sky. Then his Chains burst into being. “Once Mad Dog hears?” he cocked a brow. “But who will tell him?” \par
Far too late, Derrick seemed to realize his mistake. “…Uhh—wait—hold on, now—”\par
“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.” \par
\par


\section{23. Mad Dog (II) }
\par
Derek's fist blazed red. With a shrill cry, he swung for Zane's face.\par
To Zane, it seemed to come in slow motion. He had enough time to take his Chain, wrap it around his fist, casually lean out of the way, pivot, and unleash a right hook straight through Derek's midsection.\par
To him, his fist barely felt any heavier. To Derek, it would have felt like about two school buses ramming into him at supersonic speeds.\par
Actually, to Derek, it would have felt like nothing. Because Derek's body exploded. One moment there was a human, the next a shower of gore. All his ribs had been pulverized in an instant. Zane couldn't find a bone intact. He couldn't find anything intact. There was very little evidence that there had been a human once, other than all the blood.\par
The instant his fist connected, the sensation of his hand ripping through flesh, bone, and muscle, coming out clean on the other side—he found it immensely satisfying.\par
Then he realized what he'd done.\par
"Oops," said Zane. He blinked at his bloodied hand. He hadn't meant to kill the man. At least not immediately. Just very badly hurt him. He must’ve been angrier than he thought.\par
Zane stood. This anger felt odd. He knew intellectually he was quite angry. But inside, he felt a strange calm. His head was totally clear. He might have thrown too much into that punch, but throwing the punch was no mistake.\par
He saw the shock on the other Mad Dogs' faces as they stared down at what had once been their boss. About half of them charged him, furious. And one by one, with an almost surreal calm, he annihilated them. He moved quickly, brutally. He walked right through them, and where he passed, they melted. He didn’t hold back. He wasn’t sure he could in that moment. \par
Once he'd finished them off, he found the rest of the Dogs kneeling, cringing.\par
"I surrender," choked one. "Please! Please, mercy!”\par
"It was his idea, Derek's idea! I had nothing to do with it, I swear!” cried another.\par
He was almost disappointed. He wanted them to charge him. \par
…Was there something wrong with him? \par
He sighed, and instead wrapped them all in his Chains, and placed a Sacred Bind on them. He took no joy in slaughtering cringing enemies. His people had heard what they meant to do to them. They could decide these cretins’ fates.\par
Level Up! \par
Essence Level 43 -> 44\par
Huh. That was what, six Level thirty-ish fighters? He’d been closer to a level than he’d thought. \par
Skill Learned:\par
Inferno Lash I (Active) [Rare]\par
Infuses the Chains with the Law of Ignition, making a hybrid strike which blazes with the intensity of fire, and carries the weight of steel. A striking Technique which ignites on contact, incinerating the enemy. \par
Sounded a lot like what he was already doing—only rather than have his flames dance over these Chains, the Laws of Ignition were weaved straight in. Neat. \par
He turned to the watching townspeople, then gestured at the frozen captives. “Anyone have some spare ropes?” \par
***\par
He pondered what’d just happened as he watched them tie up the last of the Mad Dogs. \par
He’d killed someone. \par
He felt like it should be significant. But it didn't feel any different from any other time he'd killed. No different from when he'd squished a goblin. Should he feel different?\par
It did sort of bother him. Not at an emotional level but at an intellectual level. It bothered him because he felt he should be bothered. But he wasn't. Did that somehow make him less human, this lack of feeling? \par
He felt fine. That felt… wrong. \par
“...Eh.” They’d threatened Reina, and something told him Tom wasn’t lying about what they did with captured women. Then they’d threatened Zane. They’d threatened his Faction. He couldn't be too bothered about feeling guilty. If he judged it right to kill, he would do it, he decided. There was no point needling himself uselessly. He’d do what he thought was right, and move on. Simple.\par
He breathed out.\par
He was pretty sure he just made peace with killing a man. \par
 …It still felt a little too easy. Eh. \par
*** \par
Hardly half an hour had passed when he called an emergency meeting. \par
"I'm leaving. Now," he told them.\par
"What?!” said Reina.\par
"Sooner or later, Mad Dog will realize something happened to the people he sent, then he'll come for us. For you, he's terrorizing all southwestern Washington. Well. Something has to be done." \par
Zane’s gaze swept the crowd. They were all shivering, nervous. \par
"So, before Mad Dog takes his revenge," says Zane, "I'll go to him. I'll strike first."\par
He was saying true things. Justice, duty, those things were part of it, maybe; they were nice-to-haves. And he was kind of pissed at how they’d spoken to Reina. \par
But there was also another reason, deep down. A reason that spoke to the core of him. \par
He'd been squashing F-ranked dungeons all week. He was bored out of his mind. \par
Now this? This sounded like a challenge. This was exciting. \par
"I'll go with you," said Reina.This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road. If you spot it on Amazon, please report it.\par
"No," he said, “Too dangerous."\par
"This is too dangerous, but an E-ranked dungeon isn't?"\par
Zane sighed. "Someone needs to look after the rest of the faction. We're the two strongest here. What’ll happen to everyone if we set out together and something goes wrong?"\par
These were all good points. But again he knew there was also a deeper, more selfish reason. Sure, he liked party raiding with Reina every so often. She was a good partner. But he missed the thrill of being alone, of letting loose without a care, of embracing danger like an old friend, of having win or loss rest totally on himself. \par
The neat thing was, he was pretty sure it was also the best thing for the safety of the Faction. \par
"It's just… I worry about you," mumbled Reina. He sensed she was about to get weird again. She had this tell—she started looking at her feet, fidgeting, playing with her hands. "I just… want you to be safe.” \par
It was strange. She was so sensible most of the time. Then, sometimes, times like this, she went a little loopy. And it only seemed to happen around him; she was fine around everyone else. It baffled him.\par
"Don't go," she urged him. "Stay with me. I mean—with us."\par
"This is as good a chance as we'll ever get to end this," he said. “Striking while they’re not ready. I have to go.” \par
Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.\par
“Then let me go with you!”\par
"Don't be silly. I'm only one person," he said reasonably. “You said you were worried. If we both leave, we're putting the entire Faction at risk. Then you'll be worried about everyone else."\par
Suddenly she seemed annoyed. "Yeah. Good point," she said coolly. "I'm being silly. I'll keep it in mind."\par
Oh, good. She snapped out of it. “If I’m not back after twelve hours,” he said, “Take the Faction and make for the Cascades. The Knights of Cascadia will take you."\par
"Fine," she said, crossing her arms. \par
He couldn't tell if she was mad at him. Did he say something wrong? He picked over his words then shrugged. He didn't think so. It was probably nothing. He was probably overthinking it.\par
*** \par
First he sketched out the map the Beacon gave him. A thin line of yellow ran between the Luminous Faction and the Mad Dogs. They'd cleared a bunch of small F-rank Dungeons back-to-back-to-back—they must have planned this skirmish. They'd blitzed them out in half a day.\par
He set off. \par
He sped into the night, dashing through wide-open plains, then claustrophobic jungles, then rugged hills, one after another. Most of it was some kind of forest. He passed what might have once been a river dungeon once in his three-hour run. He was going well past the highway speed limit, and he was still pretty fresh as he closed in on his target.\par
The trees faded out into endless grassy plains. Once upon a time, this must have been farmland. The terraforming made it look like something out of the Sound of Music. He was getting used to how things looked now—the larger-than-life, brighter-than-life nature of this new world.\par
 It was much nicer running through plains than the tangled mess of vines, trees, and bogs. Another half-hour dashing down the plains, and the ocean came into view, a suggestion of blue in the far distance. He felt its cool salty breeze on his face before he saw it.\par
Soon he saw lights glimmering on the dim midnight horizon. Buildings. He realized he knew this place—or what this place had been. Emerald Bay Harbor. His mom used to take him to the Emerald Bay fair every summer, where they put on a hot dog eating contest. He entered once when he was like seven, got three hot dogs down, then vomited for half an hour. Mom consoled him with cotton candy. His main impressions were of the bay, of ships big as buildings gliding by, stacked high with shipping crates…\par
…Crates that ended up in a warehouse. His warehouse, likely. Weird how these things came together.\par
He did hear the neighborhood nearby was rough. Mom always insisted they leave before it got too dark.\par
Eventually, he saw the pale yellow wall dividing this safe zone—the Golden Plains—from the next. At the boundary, the rolling fields halted instantly, replaced by huge stretches of concrete and road. He stepped on through.\par
You have entered Safe Zone \par
Bastion Harbor (E) \par
He slowed down as he got close to the harbor proper. Most of what made it the harbor was gone: all the ports, the places for ships to dock, the ships themselves—all replaced. Hulking fortresses of steel loomed in their place, peering over turbulent dark waters. Most seemed abandoned, empty. No lights shone through their windows. No torches burned on their walls. Maybe they housed bosses or monsters once, before they were cleared. \par
Just one fortress interested him. The biggest one, the one at the very center of the harbor. The only one that gushed light.\par
A monstrous compound rose up from the widest pier in the harbor. Its walls were shipping containers, welded badly together. Inside them stood an ugly brute of a fortress that must have once been a shipping warehouse. It was coated in sheets of metal so thick, they could’ve been scraped from the hulls of one of those sea barges. Maybe they had been. That thing was built to take a beating.\par
Cranes loomed over it—he thought he could make out legs dangling from them. Makeshift guard towers, maybe? Essence lamps hung all over the place, but there was no electricity. Just a strange hodgepodge of old and new.\par
The only way in was through these heavy sliding gates made of woven metal rods. Ship cables towed them open and closed, like a portcullis. Manually operated, far as he could tell. The words MAD DOG were graffiti’d all over the gates. It was hard to see, but he could make them out over and over again on the walls, even on the cranes. They weren’t shy about letting the whole world know exactly where they were. \par
He heard laughter trickling out from within, the clinking of bottles. They were having a fun little party in there. Huh.\par
Then he heard moaning. It came from one of the fortresses nearest him—a dark one studded with rows of barred windows, one he’d thought was abandoned. Frowning, he drew closer. This one was a prison, it seemed. He saw faces so thin and pale they could’ve been corpses peering out a him—dozens of them. Maybe hundreds? They shrank away quivering as he came up. \par
“Hey,” he said. “I’m not here to hurt you. You’re the Mad Dogs’ captives, aren’t you?” \par
There were two floors of cells now, he realized. The first floor was just men. On the second, he caught a glimpse of women pressed up against the bars. But they fled, crying out softly, when he drew close. The men were dressed in rags. The women, less than rags. So Tom was telling the truth. \par
Only a handful of the men dared stay to face him. “Please, sir,” rasped one, and old man with rheumy eyes. “Please—can you spare some bread?” \par
“Soon,” Zane promised. “First, that big compound over there. That’s where all the Mad Dogs live?” \par
The man’s eyes widened. “You… you’re not one of them! You’re—” \par
“Answer the question.” \par
He nodded quickly.\par
“Are there any captives inside? Any innocents?” \par
“We’re all here, sir,” whispered the man. “They don’t let any of us into the Pit. Only Dogs can go in the Pit.” \par
Zane nodded, satisfied. As he started to walk away— \par
“Wait!” the man cried. “You said—” \par
“Soon,” Zane repeated without looking back. He kept walking.\par
There was no way to get near without popping up on the mini-map. And there was no way he could scout them from out here. He was going in blind. He had to make his first shot count.\par
He summoned his Chains. He breathed out, long and slow. He smiled. \par
Then he heard the shouts from on high. Lights blazed on the cranes. The guards had spotted him. No going back. \par
Even for him, a few hundred Level 30’s, plus someone around his Level was a bit… much. He should probably even the odds a little before they started.\par
Let’s try out the new thing. Inferno Lash. He grabbed his Chains and threw, hard as he could—and he could throw very hard indeed right now. Not at the Fortress—above it. The Chains were so black they blended into the night sky. Higher and higher they climbed… \par
The Chains were light to the Sage. But heavy to everything else. \par
He’d once heard that a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building had enough force to cut through a man’s skull when it hit the ground. \par
The Chains were still climbing. It’d felt like pitching a very unwieldy baseball. Climbing, climbing… and their weight scaled with his Level. At Level 44, they were no pennies. He wasn’t sure their exact weight—somewhere between a plane and a small ship, he figured. \par
Then, a few hundred feet in the air directly above the compound, they started to drop. \par
How much damage could these things do, falling around terminal velocity? \par
Probably enough. \par
But just in case—he loaded them with Inferno Lash to explode on impact. \par
He had a feeling this was about to be very loud. \par
\par


\section{24. Mad Dog (III) }
\par
The Chains fell slower than he'd thought. One dark line wiping downward. From a distance it looked like a guillotine descending on a chopping block. He'd expected some kind of sound—a drawn-out shriek, maybe? He heard nothing from where he stood. There were literal crickets chirping.\par
The Chains were coming closer, and he supposed they did seem a little faster. Maybe he'd miscalculated. Maybe it wouldn't be enough.\par
They landed.\par
Zane was blasted off his feet. His ears popped. All he heard was a high-pitched whining. Dimly he felt himself hit something, felt that thing give way—he tumbled through something else, rolled to a sloppy halt.\par
Coughing out a leaves and dust, he stumbled to his feet.\par
Where a compound had stood just seconds ago, there was a smoking ruin.\par
The walls were flattened. The cranes lay on their sides.\par
White fires raged across the land, melting steel plates off the walls. The gates, the walls, the whole front face of the compound had toppled over, giving him a clear view of the warehouse proper. He gave whoever made it some credit—it was only mostly ruined. Its front was squished in. The roof was crushed, slanted to the ground, burning so bright it was drowning in a lake of its own molten steel. There was too much smoke to see much else.\par
\par
Level Up! \par
Essence Level 44 -> 45\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 45 -> 46\par
\par
So that was at least half of them wiped out, probably a lot more.\par
He stood there waiting. Were there survivors? Had he overdone it?\par
He was relieved to find there were dark shapes picking through the smog. A horde of them, coughing, swiping at the smoke pouring out through the mouth of the ruined warehouse.\par
One shape cast a bigger shadow than all the rest. It emerged from the smoke.\par
This was a mountain of a man, so laden with muscle it was hard to believe all of it fit; they bulged all over him, jostling with each other, competing for space on his gargantuan apelike frame. He was bald, with a sharp angular face. Across his chest—Mad Dog in capital letters.\par
He lumbered out into the yard.\par
\par
Luke Grieves (Creature)\par
Essence Level 45\par
Class: Berserker \par
Law: Minor Law of Hardening (Elemental Law of Earth)\par
\par
Skills: \par
Overclock (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Taps into a primal rage, bringing for the full potential of the body. Strength, speed, and vitality are all drastically boosted for a brief stint. \par
Iron Fist (Active) [Uncommon]\par
The fist takes on the weight and strength of iron, raising damage 25\%. \par
Iron Skin (Active) [Common]\par
Grants inhuman resilience, granting extreme endurance against cutting attacks.\par
\par
His weaknesses, shown in red, were like any other human's—chin, back of the head, eyes, liver, groin.\par
That Law bit caught Zane's eye. It was the first time he'd met someone else with one. Fascinating… The more he saw of this man, the more excited he got. He had a feeling this would be a good one.\par
Mad Dog stomped out into the yard. Their eyes met. Mad Dog's eyes were bloodshot, wide, trembling. But he didn't look shaken. \par
Instead he grinned. “You!” he rasped, “You just fucked up my base!” \par
"That's right," said Zane.\par
"And you're alone. All alone!"\par
Zane nodded.\par
Then the Mad Dog started to giggle, to his surprise. Giggles turned to laughter, full-throated laughter. “You're fucking insane! I love it!”\par
He stomped out towards him, out through the smoking crater of the portcullis, and his minions streamed out behind him. There were a dozen or so in all. A quick sweep told Zane they were all high-level 30s. They all looked furious.\par
Mad Dog stopped short of him and licked his lips. They eyed each other—Zane a graveyard of calm, Mad Dog twitching, trembling.\par
"You've come to challenge me!" sniggered Mad Dog, eyes bulging. \par
"Your man threatened my Faction,” said Zane, “I’ve come for vengeance.” \par
The Mad Dog looked at him. Really looked.\par
"No, you haven't," he breathed at last. "I see you. I see it in your eyes! You're like me, aren't you? You just like to hurt!” If you stumble upon this tale on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
Zane was silent. Then slowly, he started to smile too. "Not quite," he said. "But close." Somehow, at a glance, this Mad Dog had come closer to knowing him than pretty much anyone else. Maybe it took one to know one.\par
“Who sent you, Zane Walker?” purred Mad Dog, “The Iron Legion? The Thanatos Guard?"\par
"I'm here all on my own."\par
“Ahh. Good, good. Well, then! Have at you!"\par
And he lunged.\par
Zane whipped an Inferno Lash. Mad Dog raised his forearm; Zane saw Law smoking off his skin. The limb went shiny, metallic.\par
The Chain landed; Mad Dog skidded back nearly ten feet, hissing. "Fuck," he screamed. "That hurt!" And he grinned wider.\par
White fire danced atop the skin… and smoldered out. What? \par
The Mad Dog might have said it hurt, but he hardly looked damaged at all. Fire and earth had met—an earth had won. Easily.\par
Could it be that Laws of Fire were simply weak to Laws of Earth? He supposed it made sense, elementally—\par
The rest of Mad Dog's minions had circled him, closed in on him, and the man himself sprang for Zane, slobbering, cackling. There was no time to think. Mad Dog threw a hook down low. Zane countered high.\par
Mad Dog's fist landed first. He felt it deep in his gut, a fierce spike of pain; the wind went out of him. Then Zane's Chain slapped down, slapped the man straight into the ground. There was a harsh clang just before impact—rather than smash the Mad Dog’s head like a pumpkin, it just sent him flopping away, howling. He was up in a second. And he was grinning.\par
So was Zane. They met each other’s eyes. Nice shot, their expressions seemed to say. \par
Then an axe scored a gash in Zane’s side. He turned, hissing, whipped out his Chain, nearly took the man's head off. A punch caught him by the ear, sent his head spinning; a sword stabbed an inch into his belly, ripped him clean up the middle. But his Chains reached wide, and he paid them back in full as they tried circling out.\par
\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
\par
Shit, but there are still so many of them. Annoyingly many. They ripped at him from all angles, and he couldn't block everywhere, couldn’t throw everywhere at once. He just had to keep eating them. Then came the Mad Dog, rushing in to take out a chunk of him. Zane would slap him out. He’d get back up, seemingly barely hurt, still smiling his manic smile. And lunge in again.\par
Zane was getting dangerously close to 50\%. This wouldn't do. He had to think. Roaring, he spun his Chains about, lighting them up, blasting out a Chain Cyclone. His attackers were forced stumbling back. He had space to breathe.\par
There were still eight of them. Eight of them and the Mad Dog. Still just a little too many. They were too close to grapple. He needed a plan; he always had a plan—but there was no time to identify them all, no time to put all the pieces together.\par
So his plan was: Fuck it.  \par
No more grappling. No more playing around. There were too many of them, too close.\par
He wrapped his Chains around one arm, loop after loop. Then the other, and mashed them together like gauntlets. He grinned a challenge at them all. Come get me! \par
And like rabid dogs seeing bloody meat, they lunged for him.\par
A sharp pain in his side, he whipped through a punch, shattered ribs, a fist caught his arm; he turned, broke its owner's face. Without the Chains to keep them off, they could crowd him up close. They could touch him whenever they wanted.\par
\par
Warning! Health under 50\%!\par
Savage Body activated!\par
Strength increased 25\% \par
Speed increased 25\% \par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
\par
But he could touch them too. \par
Insides ruptured, heads caved in. There was no time to think. He felt their axes chopping into him, hacking off slabs of flesh, he felt their steels carving up his legs. Already he couldn't feel most of his right leg. His left was wobbly too, but he kept slinging blow after blow. He was cresting a wave of feeling, faster and faster; he started to laugh. He slammed an elbow through someone's face so hard it split clean down the middle.\par
The Mad Dog threw an Iron Fist at his face. He ducked and ripped the Mad Dog to the liver. It felt like punching a slab of solid steel. The Mad Dog went spinning, spitting streams of blood.\par
\par
Warning: Health under 25\%!\par
\par
Zane whirled around. He kept expecting a spike of pain to the back, but none came. Then he blinked and took stock of his surroundings.\par
He’d started with twelve enemies. There were two left standing. The Mad Dog, and a tall thin one at his side. \par
Then there was Zane on one leg, bleeding half to death.\par
He locked eyes with the Mad Dog. Again they grinned at each other. They both seemed to sense the end. The Mad Dog lunged for him. So did the last minion. And Zane took them on, burning feverish hot. \par
He took a hit, slammed one back with twice the force. A fist clocked him hard up the chin, had him dizzy, blinking dark spots out of his eyes, but he lashed out, found flesh, and sent the Mad Dog scurrying. Back and forth they went, tearing at each other. The Mad Dog's last fighter played it smart. He never came in too close, never let Zane finish him off. He just lobbed from the sidelines, shoving Zane off balance here, slashing at him there, trying to give his boss an edge in this furious dance to the death. \par
Zane was getting near critical health. But he could tell the Mad Dog was slowing faster. The man didn't look hurt, but he’d stopped using one arm. His knees wobbled ominously, and he sagged over one side gasping. \par
Zane had hit him so many times, so hard… all that concussive force had to go somewhere. Seemed his organs couldn’t take it anymore.\par
The calculus had changed. Now Zane's grin widened, showed teeth. They traded one more blow. \par
And the Mad Dog sagged to a knee.\par
“Good,” he croaked. Blood dribbled from his lips. “Good, good, good! It seems you’ve got me, Zane Walker.” \par
“It does,” said Zane. \par
The Mad Dog cackled. “Shame, isn't it? I never want this to end! I'm having so much fun!”\par
Zane smiled grimly. They both knew he was too. \par
But he still stepped up, raising a fist—\par
The Mad Dog lunged.\par
Not at Zane. At his own man. The man fell back surprised, but he was a half second too slow. The Dog closed two meaty fists around the man's neck. And twisted.\par
It took Zane that same half second to realize what was happening. He leapt, but with his lame leg he could only get so far. Not far enough. The Mad Dog screeched, and rammed in elbow after elbow after elbow— \par
—the man fell limp, a broken doll. And the Mad Dog stood.\par
There was a brilliant white flash.\par
And he was healed. Whole. \par
Zane stared in disbelief.\par
Then snorted. "You planned that?"\par
That’s my trick. \par
“It’s insurance!” said the Mad Dog, giggling. "I'm always close to a Level. When I’m close, I don’t go up! In case something like this happens, you see.” He licked his lips. “That's the thing about creatures like us."\par
He tapped his skull. “Mad dogs get put down. You have to think! You’ve gotta be mad and sane. All at once! You did well, Zane Walker. You fucked me up real well. Fucked up my crew, too! Ah… too bad, too bad. Good fight. Good-night!”\par
He came at Zane for the last time.\par
\par


\section{25. Mad Dog (IV) }
\par
Zane was pretty sure he was fucked.\par
At least he’d torched the Mad Dogs pretty badly. His people were probably safe. There was hardly anyone left to go after them. He did his job.\par
Was this how he went out? Hobbling on one leg, wrecked by a rabid gang boss?\par
Eh. Was it so bad? He was never overly concerned with his own mortality. ‘It is not the length of life but the depth of it,’ and all that. He just wanted to go out swinging.\par
Strange, though. As he saw the Mad Dog stalking toward him, his head knew it was over. \par
But somehow he didn't believe it. Not in his heart. Somehow he still thought his foe would burn out before he did.\par
He was simply having too much fun to stop. He wanted to keep going, keep burning, on and on, a flame in the endless night, and all he felt was a heady, breath-stealing rush. His body, his soul, ran far too hot. \par
The Mad Dog grinned a feral grin. Their smiles were mirror images.\par
"To the end?" He rasped.\par
"To the end.” \par
And they tore into each other. They went blow for blow. The Mad Dog's body seethed gray essence. He must have tapped into his skill Overclock, since each punch thudded so heavy it rattled down Zane’s whole skeleton. It felt like he was getting holes punched in him one by one. He returned fire, throwing with all he could, fists blazing, igniting, fizzling out on that loathsome metallic skin. He hit harder—it didn't matter. He couldn't break through. It wasn't enough—\par
He didn't care. They were both laughing now, laughing with utter abandon. They were free. \par
Warning: Critical Health\par
Savage Body Activated\par
Strength Increased 50\%\par
Speed Increase 50\%\par
Vitality Increased 50\%\par
The Mad Dog clocked him up the head, and he nearly went out. He felt the world wobbling.\par
No.\par
He spat out a bloody tooth. The next blast came, ripped him so hard to the midsection he felt it reached beyond, past the shattered ribs, vibrated into the bones of his back. Something cracked.\par
He lost all integrity in his stance. He couldn't feel his legs; his spine had shattered.\par
He was still laughing. No, no, no!\par
The Mad Dog hit him one more time, knocked out half his teeth. But all he did was show the man his checkered smile. All he did was throw back, blast him off his feet. Fire licked the Mad Dog's arms, tongues of flame flowed down his legs. But it couldn't hold. \par
Zane had nothing left.\par
His body had nothing left. But his soul burned brighter than it ever had; on the cusp of death, he felt so deeply alive. He had so much joy in him he didn't know what to do with it. His eyes were watery—was he seriously crying? He was crying, and laughing, all at once. \par
The Mad Dog giggled. "Holy fuck," he said. "You're madder than I am!"\par
This was the truth of the matter. You would never beat the fight out of him. So long as he lived, that fire would burn. His heart was still beating strong as ever, beating to the tune of one anthem—I will not go out! \par
And something cracked. Deep in him, at the heart of him. He stilled. He saw the last wisps of flame flickering out on the Mad Dog’s skin, and he saw within them a tear. A tear in the fabric of the Universe. \par
He peered into the great beyond, and he saw the Truth. The Truth of the world. The Truth of himself. As One. \par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of the Undying Flame (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
He blinked at it. Then he started choking, since his laughing brought up gobs of blood. If only like these comprehensions were like Level Ups! God knew he needed healing right now. \par
The Mad Dog flew at him, and Zane ripped an Inferno Lash. It caught on the Mad Dog’s forearms yet again. But the man was wise to Zane's tricks now. He’d planted his feet deep and took the impact—it hardly moved him.\par
"I will remember you," whispered the Mad Dog. “Friend.”\par
They weren't friends, of course. But it was pretty sad Zane knew exactly what the man meant.\par
Then the Mad Dog hissed. “Fuck!” He glared at his forearms. “…What?!” \par
His forearms misted with Law. Suddenly, they steamed with it. Laws of Hardening crashed against Laws of Ignition—and muted them.\par
But this fire had two Laws. \par
And the second took hold where the first could not. It took those Laws of hardening as its fuel, and ate through them, and flared ever brighter. The Mad Dog screamed.The author's narrative has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\par
"What did you do?!"\par
He slapped at it, brushed it against his leg, but it wouldn't go away. All he'd done was ignite his legs and his other arm.\par
He was beginning to drip. His skin melting off his body in real time. \par
The Mad Dog stopped. His head swerved to Zane; his eyes bulged bright. \par
He came in like a hurricane, fists flying, one after another. He tried biting, he tried kicking, he tried sneaking in elbows, spinning, lunging for Zane's legs. But Zane was no longer exchanging. He saw it now. All he had to do was hold!\par
His Chains wrapped him in a cage, blocked one after another after another. No offense, all defense. Slowly, they were getting thrown back. Slowly, the Mad Dog was shoving through.\par
But by the time he had forced an opening, his legs no longer listened to him. He frowned at them, disappointed. The muscles were sloughing off the bone.\par
Then the flames were up to his neck, up to his head. “You sly bastard!” He giggled. “You sly—”\par
Then he couldn't say anymore. The flames had taken his neck. For a while, he stood there shaking; Zane imagined he was laughing. Then the flaming body came down to the knees and toppled over. Then it was no longer recognizable as a body—just a lump. And then, not even that. \par
White flame still burned on the ashes. \par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 46 -> 47\par
Zane knelt there in numb silence, staring at the spot where a man had just been. The system wiped away all death. There was no evidence. The only sounds now were the crackling of the distant flames—flames still burning in the compound. Flames that might burn forever.\par
It was still the dead of night, but somehow, when he looked up, he expected to see the sun rising. He felt an immense gratefulness in his heart.\par
Sighing, he stood. He found he was still smiling. He stood there for a long while, letting the feeling soak through him, head held high, watching the burning of the stars. He let the feeling run its course. He might have stood there ten minutes, or an hour. He wasn’t sure. \par
He breathed out.\par
Well. That was neat. Time to go break out the prisoners.\par
***\par
They were scared at first when he came up to the bars. Even when he melted them. Even when he told them they could go free. Only when he coaxed them, told them to identify him, see his Faction, did they slowly start to trust him. \par
They couldn't have been in here for longer a few weeks. Still so many of them looked broken, listless. The mad dogs had chosen to give the men's rags; the women were hardly dressed in scraps. Zane wished he had something to give then. \par
 \par
It turned out that wasn't the only prison he found three more. In total there were nearly four hundred people. Most were grimy. Some were barely lucid. A fair few started weeping as soon as he broke them free. \par
 \par
He promised them shelter, food, clothes and safety if they came with him. Nearly all did. Together they took the long march back to camp. \par
 Reina was oddly emotional when she saw him returning. She ran to him as soon as he popped up and hugged him silently, the way a drowning person might hug a rescue tube.\par
It was funny comparing the reactions. Cale just smiled and waved. “Hey, congrats, man! Woah. Who are all these people?” \par
***\par
Later that week...\par
Bellevue, Washington\par
Avery Lively, Signature Title Joker Savant, lay on her favorite park bench, humming cheerfully to herself, reading a book by Seneca. This was Grover Park, her favorite park. Well—before the terraforming, that was. That had changed the trees and the grasses and the fountain, but it kept the benches mostly the same—they were just wood now instead of metal. She liked wood better anyways.\par
It was such a beautiful day. She smiled. If you closed her eyes, felt the sunlight on her face, she could almost imagine this was the before-times—\par
The Beacon Stone in her pocket ran hot. She sighed, blinking, and sat upright. She looked up. Dark puffs of storm cloud loomed on the horizon… drat.\par
She picked up the Beacon Stone. "Hey, what's up?" she said. She listened.\par
"... Really? No way!” She paused. “And he’s Signed?"\par
“…”\par
"Ah—"\par
She felt something. Someone was there. A trembling hand holding a trembling string, slowly drawing.\par
"Sorry, one sec."\par
She puffed out a cheek, listening. Not to the Stone this time. To her senses.\par
"Yeah," she said to the Stone. “The guy’s just... taking a while to let go. I think it's nerves. He’s shaking a lot. Maybe it's his first time? Or maybe he heard what I did to the last guy.”\par
Another pause.\par
"Wait, wait, I think he's going for it! Yes, there you go. Come on buddy, you’ve got it—“\par
Thirty yards away, atop the transformed skyscraper behind Avery, the Level 43 Iron Legion Sharpshooter let go of the arrow.\par
At the exact same moment, Avery casually tilted her head an inch to the left. The arrow whistled by her, struck the ground about a dozen feet ahead, and exploded, showering mud everywhere. Avery shielded the book with her body. She wrinkled her nose. “Yuck.”\par
When she checked up on it again, she found a mud splatter had somehow gotten through. "Aww..." she sighed.\par
"Sorry," she said to the stone. "Assassination attempt. I think the Legion’s still mad at me. One sec. Let's see if he tries again... Nah. He's gone."\par
Avery thought about going after the guy, but it was her off day. Besides, it was such a nice day. It’d be a shame to dirty it with murder. She un-scrunched her face.\par
It lit up in a playful grin. "Okay. So tell me more about this Zane guy. He seems fun.” \par
***\par
Seattle, Washington\par
Iron Legion Faction Headquarters\par
A man sat in his throne room overlooking the rest of the city, watching the stormclouds roll in.\par
He ruled from a fortress called The Bastion, which had once been known as the Seattle Center. Towering black tombstone walls caged in the premises. Sentry towers popped up here and there. His throne room lay at the top floor of what had once been the Space Needle.\par
It still looked much like it had—only more so. Its sleek lines were drawn outward, made more angular and imposing. It was encased in an alloy of steel and obsidian, giving it a faintly volcanic air. Glowing red glyphs ran up and down its sides, powering the wards. Its peak was now a crown of spectral spires. A ghostly light poured out from it which could be seen for miles. \par
It had been a D-ranked dungeon at first, stacked with four bosses. With his Faction, the man on the throne had cleared them one by one. His name was Marcus Blackwell. His Signature Title: Soldier of God.\par
He had a man-sized map of the state pinned to the wall with a dagger. It covered all the factions of Washington State. Every day, it shifted a little. \par
Today, the bottom quarter had to be totally replaced. A pin marked ‘Mad Dog,’ was plucked out. The pin ‘Savage Sage’ was put in.\par
Blackwell gazed at it in silence. \par
There was him, a black pin in Seattle. Red arrows drew out from it. First east, then south. Faction by Faction, dungeon by dungeon… \par
Soon. \par
*** \par
The news rippled around all of Washington State. The Canadians up near Vancouver heard of it too. The ruling Factions of San Francisco and Portland took notice. \par
There was a new power in southern Washington, and his name was Zane Walker. \par
\par


\section{26. Mount Saint Helens (I) }
\par
Zane had about four hundred hungry, ill, weak, leaderless, poorly clothed, desperate prisoners on his hands. And no clue what to do with them.\par
So he went to his tried-and-true trick whenever a complex interpersonal issue came up.  \par
He sic’d Reina on it.\par
It took her three hours to sort the group out and make a plan. First she poured a chest full of essence stones into the Beacon, and brought out a massive feast. It was the first real meal the prisoners had eaten in days. It breathed some life into them. That night they had to sleep outside. \par
The next morning Reina went through them one by one and sorted them into their new roles by class — as healers, scouts, light or heavy warriors, support warriors, instructors, and a few miscellaneous support roles like builders, cooks, and guards. She traded for cartfuls of building materials and set most able-bodied folk to building. By the third day they had enough temporary housing to fit everyone.\par
For their permanent homes, she decided to spread them all out. Fifty or Sixty to a settlement, all across the various Safe Zones the Luminous Faction had claimed. They’d be like neighborhoods. Each neighborhood had a community-elected leader who reported to Reina. It took her just a week to put the plans fully in motion. She had a whole hierarchy mapped out and everything.\par
Nominally, Zane was at the top. He didn't really do anything, nor did he want to. He’d only step in when things got hairy. Reina usually didn't need his help anyway, but he could still be useful as something Reina could threaten people with if necessary. \par
Reina and Cale were both second-in-commands. But Cale was little more than a friendly public face. He was clueless about the goings-on of the faction. He was just happy to go along. Reina was really in charge. Below her were various councils and sub-leaders, all the way down to the grunts. Her schema accounted for everyone.\par
She decided the branch settlements would be semi-autonomous. From the main branch, they'd get defenses, resources, and information. In return they’d share treasures from their treasure areas. Their representatives would check in at weekly intervals in the Headquarter’s town hall. The first few weeks Reina was very hands-on.\par
There were also dozens of other little things Reina handled on his behalf, things he wouldn't have had a clue how to handle, like childcare systems and plumbing. She had this knack for finding the best people for a task and putting them exactly where they were needed. She was a born leader, a born manager. She'd only been in her mid-20s, but she'd already been overseeing the warehouse before the Change. Her work ethic was frightening at times.\par
If the Change never happened, she would’ve probably risen far higher than just warehouse manager. It was a stroke of luck getting her. She freed him to work on more interesting things.\par
Like clearing dungeons and fighting monsters, which was how he spent most of the next couple weeks. He only came back to Headquarters for dinner and sleep. \par
*** \par
In that time, the Luminous Faction Headquarters changed drastically. The central hub was still in the Crystal Back Highlands: a huge open plaza around the Faction Beacon. Quaint little houses of stone and wood clustered around. Their roofs were designed bowed in to collect rainwater, so they didn't need waste essence stones getting freshwater from the Beacon.\par
The Beacon itself was housed in the town hall, the most architecturally impressive building in the place. You wouldn't spare a second glance at it before the change, but here it was like one of Michelangelo’s sculptures.\par
There were also guard towers and healing wards scattered about. \par
Walls ringed all of it. They were made out of ‘spirit steel’—a shimmering metal that could stand up to some serious punishment. One of Zane's punches could barely dent it. You could see the slight schisms in the wall where they used Zane's fires to weld the steel together.\par
Zane also found his fires took forever to go out. Once they were burning, even he had a hard time stopping them. New rule: no fire on friendly ground.\par
Outside the walls was an open field for mock battles with straw dummies strung up, and targets for the archers to shoot at. They'd set up obstacle courses for the rogues to run through. \par
Then there was the outpost in the Emerald Forest: a bunch of treehouses strung together. You could go from many points to any other without touching the ground. Folk lived here, sure, but they were mostly here because Reina found out the treasure areas kept replenishing. The Moon Trees ripened once a month. You could walk this path to reach all the groves, and harvest them when they did. Reina had thought to assign four people the sole task of being ‘Moon Tree caretakers’—they were in charge of the picking and the nurturing.\par
*** \par
For Zane, all this went on in the background; he just saw more and more of it as he came back every day or a couple of days. Sure, he'd engage with the community. He’d make himself seen. He'd drop into a training session and do an hour of guest instruction, or spar with some of the warriors, who all treated him like some kind of demigod. At this point, he'd given up telling them off about it. He became a kind of figurehead for the faction, which was neat because that was pretty much what he'd been aiming for all along.\par
***\par
He stomped dungeon after dungeon after dungeon. He must have gone through dozens of F-ranks by now, by now. And he’d pretty much crushed all the nearby E-ranks. It was fairly trivial to solo them now. He could barely get himself excited to go out and clear them anymore. As for more F-rank… he just couldn't be bothered. Luckily, with the influx of new warriors, his people were fully capable of clearing them themselves.\par
Something else he noticed: Safe Zones didn't always stay Safe. When he checked the Beacon map one day, a Zone due north of here which he swore was Cascadia territory had reverted to being a dungeon. A week later he caught another instance of it happening. \par
Soon the Cascadia folk flipped it back—when he asked Tom about it Tom confirmed. There seemed to be some small chance for dungeons to respawn. Luckily it hadn't happened to the Luminous Faction yet, but he passed the info on to Reina. Good timing too, because not two days later one of the former Mad Dog safe Zones flipped. It was only F-rank, though. The branch settlements took care of it pretty easy.\par
***\par
One day Reina found him lying face down on the floor of his cabin, unmoving.Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\par
“No…” She gasped. “No—Zane!” She flipped him over. “Stay with me!”\par
“I'm not dying,” he said. “I'm just… bored as hell.”\par
“…” she looked ready to slap him. “Don't you scare me like that.”\par
“Sorry.” He sat up.\par
That morning he tried getting out of bed. He couldn't do it. All the nearby E-ranks were gone, and he just couldn't get excited at the thought of beating down yet another re-spawned F-rank. All the interesting dungeons for hundreds miles around were wiped out.\par
He felt like he did in that down phase after he got in his injury. He was slowly dissolving into the grayness, a horrible nothing. He always imagined it gray—gray was the color of entropy. He imagined this was what death felt like. He kept trying to think of a reason to go—a reason to do anything really—and was failing utterly. And so he lay down and waited for the world to happen to him.\par
Last time this happened it’d lasted months. It had been incredibly difficult to get up, and go get that warehouse job; he'd had to force himself second by second step by step. It had been excruciating, but he'd done it, and though he still had down bursts, things had gotten much better. He knew how to fix this—he had to get back in motion again.\par
When he said this all to Reina she gave him the oddest look. “Oh Zane…” he got the strange sense she wanted to hug him, but she held herself back. “Is there anything I could do to help?” She said softly.\par
He thought about it.\par
"I think," he said slowly. "I need something stronger. Something bigger."\par
He stood, blinking—he had an idea. The first thing all morning that got him to move, that got him excited. He walked out the door.\par
"Where are you going?"\par
"The Beacon map," he said. She followed right after.\par
He scanned the place, looking over all the reds and greens… there.\par
A chain of 13 F- and E- rank dungeons away was a different letter.\par
D-rank.\par
"Mount Saint Helens," he breathed. Caden, that mage in Tom's party, had said C- and D- ranks were on a totally different level than F- and E-ranks. Figuratively and literally—they had multiple layers. Often at least 4 bosses.\par
He could imagine a mountain with layers upon layers, sure—and what kind of nasty monsters lived there? What kind of wild treasures?! Now this he could get up for. \par
He pointed it out to Reina. 'This,” he said. 'This is exactly what I need.'\par
A flash of disappointment crossed her face.\par
“What is it?”\par
“Nothing,” she said quickly. “It’s just…isn’t it D-rank? That’s a bit…”\par
“E-ranks don’t do it for me anymore,” he said. “I need this, Reina.”\par
She looked like she wanted to protest, but she just sighed. "I get it. And I guess you don't want me there either."\par
He felt a twinge of guilt. “You’re needed here, Reina—” \par
She smiled weakly. "No. I get it, really."\par
He wasn't sure why he was justifying himself to her. This was pretty much the terms they'd agreed on. He wouldn't have bothered with anyone else, but with her it felt different.\par
"I'll be back before the week's out. Promise,” he said. "There’s no hostile Factions nearby anymore, right?"\par
"No," Reina confirmed. "There are a handful of small Factions, but we've been communicating. They're friendly. They wouldn't dare attack anyway. The nearest big one is Cascadia, and we have a non-aggression pact. You're in the clear… go get ‘em.” \par
He couldn't make himself wait until next morning. That afternoon, jittering with excitement, he set off for Mount Saint Helens.\par
*** \par
Something interesting happened on his way there. Day two of the journey, on his eighth dungeon—\par
He wrapped his chains around the head of the giant lion-spider, tightened the noose, and ripped. Fire gnawed through the chitin. The head came off easily after that.\par
Level up!\par
Level 50 reached. Second class evolution unlocked. \par
 \par
  Wildfire Warden [Epic]\par
The Wildfire Warden is a master of control. It leverages its chains to bind and subdue itsenemies. Once chained down it ignites them, burying them in a fiery tomb. Its grappling capabilities are among the best of its tier, and its striking only augments this: once itsAnchor Form grazes flesh, it is nearly impossible to get it out. For the disciplined yet brutal fighter. \par
   \par
 Soul Weapon Upgrade: \par
Endless Length: The Chains can now be shortened and lengthened at will, up to a mile long. The longer they get, the more difficult to control. \par
 \par
 New Soul Weapon Form: Anchor Form: The chain ends are outfitted with heavy, fireimbued anchor-like heads, which serve as grappling hooks. These anchors can latch ontosurfaces or pierce the flesh of enemies, locking them tight. The Warden needs only touchthe enemy to hook them.\par
 \par
Infernal Mauler [Epic]\par
The Infernal Mauler is a master of slashing. It wields its Axe Form as missile and guillotine both, and its explosiveness makes it fiendish on the hunt. In ancient times theMauler was feared across the realm: its Axe makes a ghoulish shrieking sound as it swirls on the Chain, a sound which, in many civilizations, is now associated with the greatest devilry. \par
Soul Weapon Upgrade: \par
Endless Length: Can now be shortened and lengthened at will, up to a mile long. The longer they get, the more difficult to control. \par
New Soul Weapon Form: Axe Form - The Chain’s ends are equipped with giant axe heads burning at the edges with a perpetual flame whose heat scales with your level. The Axe is capable of cleaving through multiple enemies with ease. The heads are sharp to others, yet dull to the sage.\par
 Ember Vanguard [Epic]\par
The Ember Vanguard is a master of crushing. Its Flail Spears swing with huge concussive force, and their detonations upon impact are often enough to instantly pulverize fighters of the same level. A brutal, oppressive fighter, the Vanguard seeks to dominate. \par
   \par
Soul Weapon Upgrade: \par
Endless Length: Can now be shortened and lengthened at will, up to a mile long. The longer they get, the more difficult to control. \par
New Soul Weapon Form: Flail Sphere Form - Each end of the chain features a heavy spiked steel balls, hot as magma at the tips. They explode upon impact, dealing huge concussive and heat damage. \par
 \par

\section{27. Mount Saint Helens (II) }
\par
Three different classes with three different styles.\par
… and Zane liked them all. Tough!\par
He was more drawn to the first two. Wildfire Warden was pretty similar to what he was already doing, only more so. He'd throw out his Chains like grappling hooks and sink them deep into the enemy's skin. Like whaling ships with harpoons—just hook that sucker in deep, drag them in, and end them. He liked the sound of it.\par
The second one, Infernal Mauler. This new Axe Form… it tickled him. He was thinking all the ways he could wield it and getting more and more excited. And he wasn't giving up his grappling—he still had Chains attached. It wasn't like you couldn't still strangle.\par
Plus, it said he'd gotten a 'new form'… that implied a base form, right? Could you shift in and out?\par
He was thinking about his last fight with the Mad Dogs. It would've been so much easier if he just threw two Axes in a loop and sliced them all in one clean arc. None of this slappy lashy nonsense. Fast, explosive destruction… he sure liked the sound of that, too.\par
There was something to be said for cleaving. It cut to the chase. Now he was thinking of that cavern he saw way back in his warehouse dungeon—the Cavern of Insight, and those Laws of Sharpness carved into its walls… if he chose the Mauler, those would suddenly be very useful.\par
But man. That Warden! He still did love dragging things in and crushing them… the Mauler would shift his style more to striking than grappling. …But maybe he was okay with that.\par
Besides—somehow, he doubted this would be the last Form he ever got. He'd get more subclasses. Eventually. Maybe he'd get more forms too. Who knew?\par
Yeah. He was decided. The thought of ripping, tearing, throwing out his weapons like homing missiles… but also wielding them up close, now his Chain lengths were adjustable…. He couldn't pass up this kind of firepower. This was the one.\par
Class gained! Infernal Mauler!\par
Level-up stat bonus: Vitality: +0.5, Regeneration: +0.2, Strength: +0.9, Dexterity: +0.4, Speed: +0.5\par
Class Skill Learned!\par
Inferno Cyclone (Active) [Rare]\par
In Axe Form, Chain Cyclone evolves into Inferno Cyclone. It harnesses the raw ferocity of the Axe to unleash a whirlwind of fiery destruction. This attack summons a fiery tornado which sucks enemies into the Axe's line of attack—an inescapable and fatal fate.\par
Spirit Weapon Upgraded!\par
Prometheus Chains II\par
A tool of wisdom and fire, capable of binding and annihilation both. The Signature Weapon of the Savage Sage. Currently at the second stage.\par
Stage I Powers: Heavy to others, light to the Sage, its weight scales with the Sage's level.\par
Stage II Powers: The Chains can now be shortened and lengthened at will, up to a mile long. The longer they get, the more difficult to control.\par
Soul Weapon Form: Axe Form - The Chain's ends are equipped with giant axe-heads burning at the edges with a perpetual flame whose heat scales with your level. The heads are sharp to others yet dull to the Sage.\par
Time to test it!\par
He claimed this dungeon for the Luminous Faction and moved eagerly on to the next.\par
It was an E-ranked dungeon, Thornshadow Hollow, a forest drenched in gloom. Hardly any daylight made it through the thick ceiling of a canopy. Brambles snaked up the trees and coiled down the paths. The trees were crooked, stooping, gnarled. As he passed, he got the odd feeling that eyes were watching him from the darkness above. It was a spooky kind of forest, the kind children wander into only to never return.\par
He'd seen a few variants of this kind. He supposed there were only so many kinds of forest dungeons you could make. This was scary forest \#16.\par
He brought out his new toys.\par
The Chains thudded to the ground. Zane had a trick now--he hopped before they landed so he didn't get thrown off his feet. At their ends...\par
Beautiful. Each axe head was as big as his torso, forged of a subtle yet perfectly smooth dark silver, so dark it was nearly black. That edge caught his eye—it looked like metal just brought out of the forge, constantly smoldering. It was white at the tips, stretching to deeper hues of orange as it went farther and farther into the Axe.\par
He retracted the Chain. There was no handle—you couldn't just wield it like a battle axe. It was very much a Chain weapon. He picked it up. There was little weight to it, like it was made of cardboard. But he knew if he dropped it, it would shiver the earth as though he'd dropped an anvil.\par
Carefully, he set a finger to the edge. It didn't hurt him. It didn't even feel sharp. And the fire didn't burn him either. It only tickled like the heat coming off a candle.If you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\par
Then he caught sight of a nearby tree. Thick as a Roman column. It looked like one of those old trees that had stood there for ages, sturdy enough to weather storms and time alike.\par
He thrust out the Axe.\par
It moved so fast it shocked him. It was a blur of white lines, and then it was gone. In its wake it left a huge crack, then another, then another—where had it gone? It was hard to see, and the light had suddenly vanished, leaving him lightless. Had it hit something?\par
Then pinpricks of sunlight peeked through the canopy—Zane saw why. The tree was starting to wobble. It thundered to the ground, and where its branches had been a crater of sunlike gushed through.\par
Then the tree behind it wobbled too. And the tree behind that. And the tree behind that, and on and on—\par
He called the Axe back, watching as a dozen thick trees in a row fell over, cleaved through down the middle. His Axe had cleared them like a hot knife through butter, so easy he barely felt it hit.\par
The stumps of the trees were charred black.\par
"... Shit."\par
***\par
That was pretty cool, but trees were trees. Time for a field test. He sought out the boss.\par
It was called the Wraith of Briars, this ghoul thing draped in briars that hovered around an all-white tree—white trunk, white branches, white leaves. The only color in it was a red sphere sunk deep into its trunk. It seemed to be where the Wraith drew its powers.\par
Zane sauntered casually into its lair. The Wraith whirled around, pale eyes bulging. The battle began.\par
He didn't even bother using Sage Mind on it. He just went for it, chucking out an axe. The Wraith flicked it out of the way. But he yanked hard on the Chain and the Axe caught it on the backswing. Butter. The thing flopped over, torn clean in two. Not dead, surprisingly. Just in immense pain by the sounds of its shrieking. It was trying to grab for its other half, piece itself back together.\par
That it was still living probably had something to do with that white tree. So Zane brought his Axe back around, looped it wide, and threw hard as he could.\par
The instant the Axe met bark, a matrix of wards flared brilliant blue on the trunk. There was a sound like glass shattering—then the Axe cut through, sank deep in. He could feel a glut of essence struggling to resist it, and failing. It stopped three-quarters of the way through the trunk.\par
Then his other Axe came in from the opposite side and finished the job.\par
The tree toppled over like any other.\par
The Wraith of Briars has been slain!\par
... Yeah. That was almost too easy.\par
He grinned.\par
He was ready for Mount Saint Helens.\par
***\par
Three dungeons and four hours later, he saw the edge of the final dungeon—the border to Mount Saint Helens. There, the sky went from blue to a deep relentless gray, brooding over the land. The forest was unrecognizable. On one side, it was lush green. On the other it was black, the color of ash. All the trees there were the same deathly shade of black. No leaves. No life anywhere he could see. The ground could've been igneous rock. Clouds of dust and soot drifted listlessly about in the air.\par
And in the distance, looming over it all, was a desolate mountain cut out against the gray sky. Streams of vibrant yellows and reds bubbled over the top of it, leaking down the slopes. It hacked out great plumes of ash.\par
It was as though there had been a volcanic eruption. And this wasteland was all that was left.\par
He stepped eagerly through.\par
You have entered: Dungeon: Mount Saint Helens (D)\par
Clearance Objectives:\par
Floor 1\par
Slay the Brimstone Drake\par
Slay the Ember Serpent (X) \par
(1/2)\par
Floor 2\par
Slay the Bedrock Golem\par
Slay the Molten Phoenix\par
(0/2)\par
Objectives met: 1/4\par
A boss was already cleared. So someone had been here before. Either that or someone was still here. Hmm…\par
He walked cautiously, his bare feet crunching softly against the ash beds. Something felt odd… Those trees… On a whim, he reached out to touch one.\par
It crumbled away, drifting into the winds—gone in seconds, like a house of cards toppling. Unreal. As he walked, he saw bright cracks showing through the ash. Magma spurted out here and there. It was oddly quiet…\par
There were red dots on the upper left of this mini-map. Monsters. And they were closing in at breakneck speeds—they'd be here in under a minute. He turned to face them.\par
Still, there was no sound. Nothing moved, so far as he saw--where were these things? He kept looking, but he could make out nothing.\par
He only saw them when they were nearly on him.\par
They were blended so deeply into the ashen ground they were nearly invisible. Their skin was mottled a crystalline black-and-purple, a subtler obsidian. There were six of them in a pack—\par
Nocturne Lizard (Monster) \par
Essence Level 41\par
The rest were high Level 30s, low Level 40s. These would be bosses in E-ranked dungeons. They were minions here. The implications made him shiver with eagerness. They swarmed him in an instant, hissing loudly. Their mouths blew out wide. Gobs of steaming tar gushed out at him.\par
They had him from four sides at once. But he didn't dodge. Instead—\par
Inferno Cyclone! He let his axes fly.\par
The first revolution picked up a strong gust which flung the tar gobs off course. The second threw up a full-on gale. The third, the fourth, the fifth--it was as though the atmosphere itself was burning. A blazing tornado roared to life.\par
He saw the Lizards cringing back and swept his axes low. He bet that Obsidian skin was strong as hell. But he'd built up so much momentum his Axes could not be denied. They cleaved clean through. He heard a faint crunching as they met that crystal skin; they came out the other side bloody.\par
The lizards tried pulling back—but the wind wouldn't let them. They were yanked hissing into the cyclone, into the path of his axes as they spun around one last time.\par
And cleaved their heads clean off their bodies. CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH!\par
Just like that. Six Level 40s Monsters felled in one blow.\par
No time to savor it. Right now his Chains going so fast even he couldn't stop them. He was spinning too fast, losing control—\par
He had to ram them into the ground.\par
Then it felt like he stood at the epicenter of an earthquake. Ash choked the air. When things stopped trembling, he saw two craters where the axes had struck.\par
… Now he thought of it, he could've just de-summoned them.\par
Ah well.\par
He frowned at his mini-map.\par
He wasn't the only one here after all. A clump of white popped up to the left—a dozen or so in total, moving straight for him.\par
So his antics had caught some attention.\par
The good kind, he hoped.\par
Though, even if it wasn't…\par
He was Level 50. He must've been one of a few people on the West Coast to have a third subclass. What were the odds they had a single person who could match him? And with his Axe in hand, he felt a confidence bordering on irrational. …It probably was a little irrational, come to think of it.\par
Still. He figured, let them come. He'd come this far. He wasn't about to be chased away. If they had no problem with him, good. If they had a problem with him…\par
Well. He'd come here for a good fight anyway, hadn't he?\par


\section{28. Mount Saint Helens (III) }
\par
Zane saw the man at their fore.\par
Gray-haired, blue-eyed, square-jawed. His hair was buzz cut. He held his massive body ramrod-straight. He strode with purpose, almost at a march. He could’ve been a drill sergeant.\par
Their eyes met. His were cold and haughty.\par
Victor Stroud (Creature) \par
Essence Level 54\par
Class: Lightning Lord\par
Faction: Iron Legion\par
Huh. How…improbable.\par
So… Zane was wrong. Could be some trouble.\par
Iron Legion. Where had he heard that name before?\par
The man's troops lined up behind, beside him. Each fell in with military precision. They were the the same steely-gray uniforms. They looked like straightjackets.\par
The man said nothing for a while. He simply frowned at Zane like he’d found an insect in his breakfast. Then—\par
"Zane Walker," said Stroud slowly. "The Savage Sage. How unexpected."\par
He talked, said everything slowly, deliberately, like each syllable was a stone he was placing down.\par
“You speak like you know me,” said Zane.\par
"You are the leader of the Luminous Faction. You single-handedly eliminated the Mad Dog faction. Your Faction has thirty-two zones under its command. You make liberal use of chain weaponry."\par
Zane shrugged. Pretty bang-on. He was more famous than he thought.\par
"You are the sole true power in southern Washington," the man continued. There was a pause. His lips curved into a sneer. “And yet… you are here. Far from home… Alone."\par
Zane didn’t like how he said that last word. He especially didn’t like how Stroud’s men began to fan out slowly around him, making the shape of a pincer. At a cursory glance, they picked up their Levels, all in the low- to mid- 40s.\par
“You are your Faction’s only power. Without you, your Faction is nothing... easily crushed.”\par
Stroud's nostrils flared. "It was not wise to come here alone, as you have.”\par
Now Zane remembered where he’d heard ‘Iron Legion.’ Tom had said it—he said a Signed led a Faction called the Iron Legion up north. He said they'd taken Seattle.\par
And now, for some reason, they were here. And seemingly about to attack him. Why exactly Zane wasn’t sure, but he had some guesses. In any case now didn’t seem the time for ‘why’s’. Now seemed more of a ‘what the hell do I do about this’ situation.\par
His eyes flickered from one end of their lines to the other. Was it too much? There were a few 47s, 48s in there. A little close for comfort. And this Stroud… Zane was drawing a blank. The man's face gave nothing away. Level 54… hm.\par
Yeah, Zane was strong now. Not that strong, though. He hated admitting it, but maybe it was time to get out of here. He readied his Chains. One Inferno, one opening, and in the chaos he’d look to break--\par
“Hey there! Excuse me. Am I interrupting something?”\par
The voice was high, almost melodic. It did not come out of any of Stroud’s stone-faced men. It floated over from the right.\par
On top of an ash tree, the same kind of ash tree that had crumbled utterly when Zane had touched it, sat a girl, swinging her legs lazily. A short, messy-haired, strikingly pretty brunette in a baggy hoodie. Waving at them, and grinning.\par
For a moment, all any of them could do was stare.\par
Avery LivelyUnauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.\par
Signature Title: Joker Savant\par
Essence Level: 50\par
Class: Spectral Seeker\par
When did she get up there?\par
And Signature Title? He stared at the mini map. …Huh. There were two dots with S's on them. Him, and... her, apparently.\par
The girl hopped down and landed nimbly in a crouch. Then she stood, brushed herself off, and strolled over.\par
Zane caught a glance at Stroud's face. It was the first time he'd betrayed a single emotion this entire encounter.\par
Horror. Utter horror.\par
The girl strolled up, staring up at Zane. “Hey, you're Zane, right? Hi, I'm Avery! Nice to meet you. I’m here to help.” She held out a hand, grinning. Zane stared at it.\par
“Savant,” Stroud got out. “You are not supposed to be here.” He sounded a little strangled.\par
She winked. “I have a knack for showing up in places people don't want me.”\par
Stroud glared at the girl. Avery stared right back. She seemed amused, like this was a joke they were all in on. “So… what? Are we just gonna keep staring at each other? Go on, get out of here. Fun’s over.”\par
And to Zane's shock, Stroud made a disgusted sound, a disgusted face, turned around, and stomped off. His men piled in behind him.\par
“Yeesh,” muttered Avery. “What a dick.”\par
“… Who are you?”\par
“I'm Avery,” said the girl. “Avery Lively. What’s there to know about me? Let’s see… I’m an Aries, I'm twenty, and I'm from Seattle. I was living in Seattle, then Seattle became like fourteen dungeons. Then this asshole Marcus Blackwell took control and started running the place like North Korea. I had a problem with that, so I fought him, he caught me and beat the shit out of me, and I ran away. Now I'm here.”\par
By now Zane was so baffled he just started walking away as a defense mechanism. Avery walked along with him, humming cheerfully.\par
"So what are you up to?”\par
A silence, filled only by the crunching of their steps.\par
Avery cleared her throat. “So,” she said even more enthusiastically, “What are you up to?”\par
She just kept staring at Zane with her big green eyes until Zane got uncomfortable.\par
"… I'm here to fight bosses."\par
“Sweet," said Avery. “That dickbag Stroud’s here to do the same thing. He wants to claim this territory for the Iron Legion. That’s why he’s really here, by the way. He sailed all the way down Puget Sound.”\par
…what?\par
“They're trying to do a sea invasion down south, now that they have like eighty percent of the north. I don’t really have the firepower to force them out, so instead I'm here to try to piss them off so bad they give up.”\par
She talked as they walked. Where to, Zane wasn't sure.\par
At last, he got a clue—a yellow dot popped up on the edge of his mini-map. He started wandering towards it.\par
"No, wait, not that way!"\par
Zane didn't stop. Then he felt something hit him in the back, and clatter to the ground. He turned around, disbelieving. “…Did you just throw a rock at me?”\par
“A chunk of coal,” Avery clarified. “And I’m serious. Look."\par
She picked up another nearby chunk of coal—they were scattered everywhere—and chucked it down the sooty path. It hit the ground. Then it started to sink. And sink and sink until it was swallowed whole and what Zane thought was solid ground washed over, filling the gap.\par
"That whole stretch is like magma quicksand," said Avery. "You'll get stuck."\par
"… How did you know that?"\par
"I told you. I might not have much in terms of like raw power, but I have a lot of things that make me super annoying to fight. And kill. Like my perception."\par
Avery grinned crookedly. "It's one of my Signature Skills, Echoes of Insight. Among other things, it basically gives me like a dog's nose and a bat's ears and a… uh… Well, I guess perceiving vibrations is also a bat. I'm kind of like a bat with a dog's nose.”\par
She turned.\par
"Here, follow me. This place gets really boggy."\par
"You've been here before?"\par
"Nah, just have a feeling. When you have senses like mine, you learn to trust your feelings."\par
"…"\par
Avery started walking down a wide arc, weaving between the ash trees, making seemingly random hops here and there.\par
She stopped and turned back. Zane hadn't moved. "You coming?"\par
Feeling like an idiot, Zane followed her.\par
Thankfully, Avery had stopped talking. Whenever she did, Zane started to get a headache. Instead, the girl started whistling a pop song. She was strangely good at it.\par
"Hey," said Zane at last, "What's your deal?"\par
"What do you mean?"\par
“Why are you here?"\par
“I just told you. Or do you mean like… philosophically, or something?”\par
"No," said Zane, "Why are you here with me?"\par
"Oh, that's easy," said Avery. She blew a strand of hair out of her face. "My thing is I'm very good at evasion and perception, which also makes me pretty darn good at defense. The one thing I'm bad at is offense, and you're like a very big stick. We can help each other."\par
I’m like a what now? “I don't need your help."\par
"You almost just stepped in magma quicksand."\par
"… I would’ve gotten out of it."\par
"Okay, fine," said Avery. "Put it another way. I think you’re on a collision course with the Iron Legion. Since they want to take over all the Pacific Northwest, and you're in the Pacific Northwest. And I think you're the best hope we have at actually stopping them. So… here I am! When I said I want to help, I meant it.”\par
"…"\par
“Here, let me pitch myself. I'm a great scout. And a mage, kind of. I’m good with illusions so I can do some battle support stuff, and cloaking stuff I'm excellent at. And redirection. This is a D-ranked dungeon. Have you ever been in a D-ranked dungeon?"\par
"…"\par
"Trust me, the second floor is much worse than you think it is. You'll need all the help you can get. Also, dude, I'm literally a Signed, and I'm offering my services to you for free. Like..."\par
"…" He supposed if she played support and stayed out of his way—\par
She rolled her eyes. “Are you allergic to teamwork, or something? Oh, you're so cool, Mr. Lone Wolf. You're so mysterious! Dang, bro—"\par
"Okay, okay, you can come along," said Zane hastily.\par
She beamed. "Awesome!"\par


\section{29. Mount Saint Helens (IV)}
\par
Zane had been to a hot spring once. Yellowstone, when he was eight. His mom took him along with his brother Paul. He remembered thinking it was pleasant. Until Paul tricked him into leaning too far over the railing, and shoved him into one of the acid pools.\par
He still enjoyed the trip despite the burns. Even as a child, not a lot could move him. Seeing Old Faithful erupt a hundred and fifty feet in the air, glorious and triumphant, all ruddy in the dying afternoon light, feeling the dewy rush of it on his face—it moved him.\par
This hot spring didn't spurt quite so high, but it was wondrous in its own way. There was no water. Just essence, essence clumped so thick it became a kind of mist, heavier than air, spewing up and floating gently down, bright white rings spreading out on the basin floor, making a bubbling lake of pure light.\par
He made to pull off his shirt and wade in. Then Avery said, "Oh, there’s no need. It's just essence. You won't get wet." Pause. She gave him a once-over. "I mean… if you want to—"\par
"…" He just strolled in. It felt like he'd strode into a sauna, but one whose feeling went beneath the skin, seeped through his whole body. If joy had a physical form, he imagined this is what it would feel like. A great warm bath for the soul.\par
It came from the essence pouring into him. The essence here was clumped so thick it beaded on his skin, and each little bead so about the same as a Moon Fruit's worth.\par
"It's totally different from E- and D-rank Treasure Zones, isn't it?" said Avery, grinning. She'd hopped in too. "Ah…"\par
"Yeah," he muttered, “You can actually feel it."\par
The growth he meant. If you spent a week loafing around here, doing nothing, he could probably gain a level. It was very nice.\par
Then, “Shit,” said Avery. "Incoming!"\par
He blinked up at his mini map, red dots drawing in close.\par
"Those Lizards love essence springs," she said, wrinkling her nose. "Half these springs are just infested. They're clever little bastards too. Sometimes if they see us coming they'll camp out, wait for us to wade in, and then, well…"\par
He saw about dozens of them coming over the base and Ridge on either side. Most were high Level 30, some low Level 40s.\par
"Okay," said Avery, “I'll throw up a field mirage, make them think we're going right. Then we can slip left, and—Oh my god."\par
Around the big geyser of essence, a half-dozen smaller geysers of blood shot up.\par
Zane’s Axes swept around for another loop. One Axe split a lizard down the middle, caught another by the neck, and a third through its rear legs.\par
The other Axe finished the job. He was starting to think of them as his one-two punch.\par
Avery blinked. "Fuck," she breathed. "Yeah. Definitely chose right."\par
Zane shot her a questioning look.\par
"There was another meathead up in Vancouver I was thinking of going with," she explained, “But yeah, you're definitely… what's the word I'm looking for? Y’know…" she flexed her nonexistent muscles and made a face. "Rawr! … smashier?"\par
“Please never do that again."\par
"… Sorry." Then she considered him. "Is that the first thing you think of when you see a problem? ‘How can I break it?'"\par
"Pretty much."\par
“Huh. I respect it, honestly,” she said, scratching her head.\par
He considered this ‘treasure zone’. It was nice, sure. It would make a great addition to his faction. If he made this dungeon a Luminous Faction Safe Zone and sent his people on pilgrimages here, they'd all be Level 30s in just a few weeks. Their military might would skyrocket. This was worth a lot, faction-wise.\par
But as a personal resource… not so much. He was still better off killing bosses. And laying here bathing was doing very little to ease his boredom.\par
“Alright. Enough of this,” he said. “Where’s the boss?”\par
“No clue,” said Avery. “I've only been here like a day. Which, by the way, was a day longer than I meant to be here. What took you so long? Anyway—the good news is, Stroud doesn't know either, and they've been combing this place for days. This brimstone Drake is a sneaky one. All we ever see are those minions. Never where they come from.”\par
She pursed her lips. “It’s a good thing, actually. In D-ranked dungeons, the best stuff’s always on the second floor. Stroud’s already cleared out most of the sunken chests in the Ash Forest—that's this floor. So there's nothing to do but keep looking for that boss.”\par
She grinned at him again. “Lucky for you, you have me! We'll spot this thing in no time. Trust me.”\par
***\par
‘No time’ turned out to be at least two hours of fruitless scouring later. He was seriously starting to doubt she knew what she was doing. He was also starting to get bored. One boss had already been cleared here, and all the sunken chests they came across were already looted. There really was nothing to do but search. And blast the occasional Lizard stupid enough to come for them. Avery was delighted whenever he did—“Dude, I've been running from those little shits for a day straight. This is awesome.”This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
“… you can't even kill a Lizard?”\par
She squirmed a little. “Hey, I told you. Smashing things isn't my forte. That's your thing. We're all good at our things.”\par
So far, he’d seen no evidence she was good at anything useful. She was good for spotting bogs and sitting on those weird ash trees, he supposed. Speaking of, actually—“How were you balancing on that tree earlier? It crumbled when I touched it.”\par
“That's my Law. The Major Law of Harmonic Balance. It lets me flow through things, redirect things, balance things, balance on things…”\par
“Major Law?”\par
“That's right,” she said proudly.\par
“How’d you get that?”\par
“You learn a bunch of related Minor Laws. Eventually, those Laws can be woven together to make a major Law. For instance, my Major Law’s made up of Minor Laws of Rhythmic Motion, Physical Equilibrium, Physical Synchronicity, and Physical Reciprocity.”\par
“Huh,” he said. “How’d you learn four Laws that fast?”\par
“It's mostly my Title. Makes seeing things much easier. But I had a head start. I used to be a gymnast. You have to put yourself in situations where you experience the Laws you want to know. I mean, if you want to learn…say, a Fire Law, you wouldn't just stare at fire and wait for something to happen, right?”\par
In fact, that had been exactly what he thought he’d been doing. “…”\par
“Can't ride a bike by reading about it in a textbook! You have to get out there and feel it. So, I started balancing on stuff, and meditated on it, and balanced some more, that kind of thing. I found some Caverns and treasures in dungeons that boosted Law insight, and spent days in there. Things got more extreme. Bungee cables and skyscrapers got involved… Anyway. With my title, learning Minor Laws comes easy. The hardest part was putting them all together to make a Major Law.”\par
“Is there that much of a difference?”\par
"Major is much better. It's a synthesis, y'know? More than the sum of its parts. It's really—" She stopped dead. Then looked around. They were in a clearing. A mild wind had turned up, and brushed some of the lesser ash trees off the path.\par
"Here," she said, grinning playfully. “Let me show you. Come at me. Let's have a spar."\par
He frowned. "… Really?"\par
"Wait, wait!” she said quickly. "But like, not with those Axes. Just fists. And keep it to 50\% power, at least at first." She was eyeing his hands nervously. "If I screw up, you might actually break me."\par
"… I'll go light," he said.\par
“Cool. And I won't use any Skills. Just Law." She made a ‘come hither’ gesture, smirking. He shrugged and came hither.\par
She didn't move, even when he was within arm's reach of her. His raised brow went higher.\par
"Just hit me," she said impatiently.\par
She must have some trick keeping her safe. So he threw.\par
She didn't dodge at all, even as the fist drew frighteningly close—his fist was half the size of her head. Was she just kooky? He had a sudden vision he ended up accidentally splattering this very confused girl's brains over the ground. She seemed confused about everything else.\par
He halted his fist an inch from her nose. The wind of it whooshed past, fluttering her hair, making her eyes flutter too.\par
"What are you doing?" He said. "Dodge."\par
"No, don't stop," she said. "Keep—"\par
He punched her with that last inch of space. And felt something crunch.\par
"Fuck!” she screamed, doubling over, clutching at her face. Blood spurted between her fingers.\par
"…"\par
He'd broken her nose.\par
So his vision came true. That was... both expected and unexpected. On one hand, obviously. On the other, some part of them still believed she had some magic trick to get out of the way. You didn't get to Level 50 and a Signature Title by accident.\par
… Right? Suddenly, he wasn't so sure.\par
"Ogay, Ogay,” said Avery. She sounded like her nose was clogged, probably because it was. She was holding it in place, breathing through her mouth. "Wasn't ready," she said. "I was still talking. Ah, shit—“\par
Something went wrong with her nose, and she bent over again. "Fuckfuckfuck—"\par
It took about 15 minutes for her natural regeneration to get her face back to normal.\par
Looking at her now, he was not impressed. How was it that this sad little creature had gotten that Level 54 Lightning Lord and all the cronies to fold? He was starting to think it was a mistake to let her tag along. She'd only get herself hurt.\par
"Okay,” she said, "I'm good." She gave him a bright wobbly grin as though to prove it. "Let's go again. I’ve got it this time—"\par
"No,” he said, "we're done."\par
“Seriously!”\par
He started walking away then stopped, something latch onto his leg, weighing it down. It was her. She'd dive-bombed it like a wide receiver. She glared up at him. "Try. Again."\par
He sighed.\par
"By the way," she said, getting up. "You have really thick legs. Felt like hugging a tree trunk."\par
He had no clue what to make of that.\par
This time he threw at 1\% power. So slow you could’ve dodged it even if you were a Level 1 child.\par
And she did this time, kind of. At the very last moment. All she did was turn her cheek. And his punch flowed off her, slipped off her…there was a shimmer in the air, like his fist passed through a heat wave. Then his force was gently shifted, thrown out of the way.\par
It was the same shimmer he saw when his fire burned with Laws of Ignition. The Universe bending to her will.\par
“Huh,” he said, blinking. “Neat trick.” And he meant it.\par
He tried again, through a little harder, a little faster, and the same thing happened. "Keep going,” she said, grinning. “That all you got?"\par
He did, he kind of tried to hit her this time. He threw a hook to her belly, and she turned with it, shifted. There was a shimmer where his fist tried to land, and all his force went another way. He was sent stumbling.\par
“What, you big dumb brute? Scared to hit a girl? Hit me!"\par
He sighed. "Just ask me to hit harder if that's what you mean. You're not going to rile me up. I don't work like that."\par
She threw him an exasperated look. “Okay, fine,” she said. “Then hit harder."\par
His next punch was just as hard as the first punch—the one that broke her nose. But his hand had to pass through that warped veil around her. It couldn’t. He was sent stumbling over himself again. She turned just a little. She'd barely moved, and she was grinning at him. "Harder!"\par
He chucked a haymaker at her. It slipped right off. He tried another, then another. Soon he was wailing full-on combinations. She kept lightly stepping, pivoting, twirling, shifting, in perfect flow. Smooth, dancing straight through him. It felt so weird. He forgot about holding himself back. He just tried to hit her, actually hit her. And he kept sort of hitting her, he kept touching her, and flowing off. Not bouncing off—just going another way, a way he hadn't meant. The universe was playing judo with his punches.\par
"Add in Laws if you want," she said airily. So he did. He stacked Ignition on the punch—and to his shock, it couldn't even ignite on her, it skidded right off that distortion field, flopping away. A patch of nearby ash caught fire.\par
Could he actually not hit her?\par
"Harder," she purred.\par
He groaned. "Why are you saying it like that?"\par
"...Sorry,” she said, cringing. “But seriously, though. I saw how you were looking at me earlier. See?”\par
She spread her arms as though to say, look at me now. She looked quite smug.\par
“...Fair enough. What else can you do?"\par
She thought about it. "How much do you want to see?"\par
"Give me 50\%. At least at first.”\par
She grinned wickedly at him. Then she snapped her fingers.\par


\section{30. Mount Saint Helens (V) }
\par
She snapped her fingers, and the floor fell out from the bottom of the world. He felt down a long dark tunnel; the world receded before him, shrank to a circle of light, then nothing.\par
What the fuck?\par
He tried grasping, clawing at something, anything to hold onto, even threw a Chain. He hit nothing. There was nothing but the dark. Then the tunnel opened back up suddenly in brilliant color. Sensations flooded him. He was falling through open air. The wind, cold and fast, ripped at his cheeks, stung at his eyes, roared past him as he fell flailing, trying to get a grip. Above there was only blue sky. Below, he saw a vast plain of rolling green—far, far below, half-hidden swaddles of cotton white clouds. Clouds he was falling toward at alarming speed.\par
Not great.\par
So she’d teleported him. But how is it possible? You weren't supposed to be able to leave the dungeon before it was cleared. This wasn't the dungeon… did her Signature Skills let her bypass the laws of this world?\par
That didn’t feel right.\par
All these new sensations rushed at him, over his skin, through his eyes, ears; he even smelled the crisp freshness of the air. But that was all they were. He blinked. Something about this—once he took the time to look, and not feel—felt off.\par
Uncanny valley off. Everything felt slightly unreal, lost in the jumble of feelings until he stepped back and paid careful attention.\par
That horizon… it didn't look as far off as it should. He summoned his Axe and shunted it out, smoldering with twin Laws.\par
It hardly went a couple of hundred feet before it met some resistance— and tore through it. There was a tear in the fabric of the sky. On the other side, he saw gray clouds over black trees.\par
Made sense. So this was constructed. Some kind of artificial space. Like a living mirage. He checked out his other acts and ripped another long gash. It started leaking violently, loudly. That tear seemed wide enough to fit him. He planted the axe in the soil outside, and yanked.\par
He flew tumbling out, coughing. That little trick kind of gotten him for a second there. He couldn't say he was excited. His heart was still going pretty steady, but he was at least stimulated.\par
He turned to face Avery with her arms crossed. "What the hell! You got out of that way too fast.”\par
"It was a good trick," he said. "It felt mostly real. Was it meant to scare me?"\par
"... Pretty much."\par
"There's your issue,” he said. “I don't do that." But he could see how people could fall for it. He looked back at it. From the outside it was a shimmering ball of essence, a swirling cocoon. It slowly broke down, faded out.\par
“Okay, tough guy,” she said, frowning. “Well that was only level one. That was a pocket mirage. It's pretty much a fancy cage. Small, annoying to get out of… but try this!–” She snapped her fingers, and she started to warp.\par
Her skin flushed deep red. Horns sprouted from her head, her mouth grew fangs, and on and on she grew, thickening with slabs of muscle. Giant bat-wings sprouted from her back. Her eyes burned like flames. A devil Titan floated before him, dwarfing him, gripping a spiked flail whip. It grew to the size of a skyscraper and must be visible for miles. He knew it was an illusion intellectually, but his eyes couldn't find any cracks in it. It seemed real. The Titan roared, and the earth shook. The gale-force of its torrid breath made him stagger, almost swept him off his feet.\par
"Kneel, heathen!” it said in a voice like shredding metal. "… No? Nothing?" The evil giant sounded disappointed.\par
"I mean… it's neat," he offered.\par
The giant looked sheepish. "Well, anyways. Difference here, it's not just you experiencing this, it's everyone."\par
She shrank back to normal human size and sighed. "Your mind doesn't seem very blown."\par
"I can see how it's useful," he said. "You could make enemies think you're not there. You could show them feints. You could trick them."\par
"Yeah, it's useful, but you're not... bleh. Alright, I'm done showing off. Let's get back to finding that stupid Brimstone Drake."\par
About half an hour back in their search, he had a thought.\par
"You said you fought this leader of the Iron Legion."\par
"Yeah, Marcus Blackwell, he beat the shit out of me. It sucked."\par
"How strong is he?" said Zane. "Compared to me."\par
Avery gave him a weird look. "Honest?"\par
"Yes."\par
"... He could probably beat you in under five moves," said Avery, wincing.\par
He nodded slowly.\par
"And this… Soldier of God. He's coming for me."\par
"Yeah. And he's got a lot more lackeys like Stroud, too. He was a higher-up in some private militia. He had tons of ex-military buddies. They took really well to the Change. And they're all in like the 50s and 60s. So… woah."This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
"What?"\par
She blinked. "That's the first time I've seen you smile."\par
***\par
It was sundown, and they still hadn't found that Brimstone Drake.\par
Avery might have her Laws and her mirages, but Zane was still yet to be convinced she was worth much as a tracker. Even she was starting to get embarrassed. "I swear I'm usually better at this," she said for the fifth or sixth time. They'd walked the same loop twice.\par
"I don't understand," she mumbled, "it's a Drake, they’re meant to be super rare. Drakes, really any dragon-type monster, their lairs usually have hoards. There's like five or six Bosses worth of treasures in there, sometimes stuff you couldn't get anywhere else. And like a mountain of mid-grade essence stones."\par
"Mid-grade?"\par
“Mid-grades have ten times the amount of essence that's in normal essence stones—the stuff you trade with the Beacon. Like. It should emit a huge essence signature. Why can't we feel it?"\par
She shook her head. "It should be here… Makes no sense. My Law works with vibrations. I can usually feel these things hundreds of feet away. These bosses, they should make big tremors but…”\par
She chewed her lip. “We’re missing something. I’m missing something.”\par
The waning sunlight cast the land in red and black, the color of dying hearths. It was looking like they might have to make an ash-bed or something. Find a way to stay the night.\par
They passed by another essence geyser. This one was just overflowing with lizards. They loafed all over in their dozens, soaking in the pale light.\par
Avery followed his gaze, and…\par
“…wait,” she said, “No. Is it that obvious? Those Lizards always around essence pools…. we should be able to sense the hoard and its essence, but we can’t…. the geysers are constantly erupting… I should be able to sense the tremors, but I can’t…”\par
She groaned, palming her face. “Oh my God. I swear I’m not usually this thick.”\par
He caught her drift. “Wait. You’re saying—”\par
“They’re down there.” They stared at each other. Then together, a little breathlessly, they strode toward that pool.\par
First thing Zane did was clear out the basin. He sent his Axes spinning there and back, there and back again, and by the third time, there wasn't a lizard left.\par
They marched toward the middle where the geyser spewed out. Avery knelt, put her palm against the ground, and closed her eyes. For a few moments, she was silent. Then her eyes snapped back open. She nodded.\par
“Yep. The vent opens up. There’s a tunnel down there.” Zane tried finding it through the billowing essence. It was like staring down a well of fog.\par
Something was climbing up his back. He almost squished it until he realized it was her. She pointed at the wall. “Okay, you can go down now. … What are you waiting for?"\par
He thought about flicking her off and making her climb herself, then just sighed, found a foothold, dug his fingers into the slick tarred stone, and started hauling himself down.\par
The deeper they went, the thicker the mist, until he could hardly see his own fingers. “How much farther?" he grunted.\par
“Almost there!"\par
Then he reached a point where his foot caught nothing but air. He glanced down, saw something vaguely shiny. Ground? He let himself drop.\par
They stood in the middle of a natural tunnel steaming with ghostly white essence. The ground was uneven. Obsidian crystals blanketed it, stretching up the walls, the ceiling, clustered so tight he could hardly see the porous black rock beneath. The air smelled of burning, of sulphur.\par
He stepped.\par
Crunch. He froze.\par
That crunch… it sounded just like…\par
Those were not crystals, were they?\par
He identified them.\par
Nocturne Lizard (Monster)\par
Lv. 40\par
Nocturne Lizard (Monster)\par
Lv. 39\par
Nocturne Lizard (Monster) \par
Lv. 41\par
He stared down the tunnel, and one popped up after another, endless. He blinked a the mini-map. Only now, when they touched the ground, did it switch over to another layer. The underground layer.\par
And this was a stretch of pure red.\par
A heartbeat.\par
“Uh,” said Avery.\par
Then the tunnel began to shake. The walls, the ceiling, the floors, all came alive.\par
Instantly he grabbed her and yanked her into him. It was lucky she was so small. When he hunched over and bear hugged her, he could pretty much wrap her fully, blocking her off with his back and arms. There was an ugly symphony of hisses, of shrieks, he saw those dark sleek snouts open wide, hundreds of them all at once—\par
Fuck.\par
He tried getting his Chains out, tried wrapping himself as quick as he could. But he had only gotten so much. An ocean of acid tar blasted him. His face was melting, his back was melting. His arms lit up in pain.\par
Warning! Health under 50\%!\par
Savage Body activated\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
If he'd just been half a second slower with those Chains…\par
But he'd made it. The last of the acid sloughed off him. He narrowed his eyes.\par
My turn. “Hold on tight,” he told Avery.\par
Inferno Cyclone!\par
He set his Chains to three feet long, barely enough to make a revolution in this cramped a space, and spun once, twice, thrice. Cruel iron cleaved easily through scale and flesh. A wind picked up in the tunnel, caught fire. Faster and faster he spun. The winds started howling in earnest, cackling, showering embers. He felt a second wave of tar batter at the edges of his rising storm but the fire took hold of it, ripped it apart, made it fuel, and grew hotter still.\par
Lizards threw themselves at the winds, got caught up in them, started spinning with them, spinning into those merciless scything Axe-blades. Storms were like fires. Small at first, but once they got going—good luck.\par
Wind and fire ripped down the tunnel on either side. Where they went, lizards melted. He sent one giant axe head spinning down his left, threw another down his right. He felt them scouring the walls, the ceilings, spinning back, scraping the stone clean.\par
When at last the wind and fire died down he sank to a knee, panting. Huh. There was no flesh left on his forearm. His back must be in even worse shape. Lucky thing—\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 50 -> 51\par
A flash of white, and he was fully healed.\par
Underneath the carpet of Lizards, the tunnel was plain igneous rock. Magma must’ve flowed through here once. Avery stepped out from him, tottering, dizzy, and flushed.\par
“Wait,” she gasped. “I think—I think I might be about to—ah, fuck—”\par
Then she slumped against the wall, and her eyes rolled back.\par
…\par
From just the spinning?\par
How could someone be so fragile and durable at once? She was Level Fifty. How low must her class’s Vitality stat distribution be? It boggled the mind.\par
He crouched down, sat against the wall, and waited.\par
Eventually she woke up. She blinked at him for a bit, then flushed with embarrassment. “Did I really just…? Well,” she said. “I’d say I want to crawl in a hole and die, but I’m already here, aren’t I.”\par
“Don’t die,” said Zane. “I put a lot of effort into saving you.”\par
“Oh, pssh.” She made a face. "Don’t flatter yourself. I would’ve been fine.”\par
He cocked a brow.\par
“Seriously! I can shrug off anything so long as I see it coming. I was about to redirect all that. Then this big dumb oaf snatched me from behind and spun me around ’til I blacked out."\par
“…” Ah.\par
She grinned playfully. “No, I get it. The thought was sweet. But I swear I’m more competent than I look… and seem… and act…really.” She winced. “I can take care of myself. You just do you, alright?”\par
“Will do.”\par
They picked a side and went for it.\par


\section{31. Mount Saint Helens (VI) }
\par
The farther they went, the more the ground started to crack. At first, it was an endless stretch of coal. Then little veins of red crept up. Magma gurgled deep within. Those veins grew to fissures. You could feel the heat licking at your feet, could hear the sound of huge, heavy currents churning, rumbling down the echoing tunnel… It felt like they were walking down the throat of a giant.\par
"I think we're getting close," said Avery.\par
She jerked to a halt. A fierce trembling rattled the ground, sent trails of molten rock tumbling down the walls, the ceiling. Streams of magma leapt, hissing through the cracks. Zane felt it rattling up his feet, through his whole body, felt it in his teeth. He crouched low, steadying himself.\par
"Earthquake?"\par
"No," said Avery, wide-eyed. "It woke up… it just took a step."\par
They looked at each other for a moment. Mists of essence slithered around their ankles.\par
"I feel it," Avery whispered. "It's there."\par
“Not on my mini-map."\par
“Just a little farther. I can feel it breathing—it's there."\par
"… So," said Zane.\par
"So," said Avery, scratching her head. "What's the plan?"\par
He shrugged. “We go in, I'll slash it, you distract it?”\par
She shrugged back. “Sounds good. I'll cast a field mirage around us. Get us in close."\par
A haze of essence rose up from their feet, blanketing them. But unlike normal essence, he felt nothing when it touched him, no warmth. The cloud soon hid them. They did leave some shallower patches around the eyes so he could see.\par
"Right.” Avery’s disembodied voice came through the cloud. "Let’s wreck this thing. Go team!"\par
He saw a fist come at him. At first he thought she was trying to punch him, then he realized it was a fist bump. She didn't put it down. She seemed to be waiting for him. Reluctantly, he bumped it.\par
"Say the thing," Avery insisted.\par
He started walking. The cloud didn’t follow. He sighed.\par
"… Go team."\par
"Hell yeah!” \par
Soon the tunnel opened up. He couldn't see much through the fake fog, just what was in front of him. His mini-map led the way, first down a winding stretch, and then out into open air. The ground shook the whole way. Boom… Boom… Boom… It sounded very, very heavy. He imagined it hit hard as hell too.\par
He smiled.\par
Geysers of putrid smoke poured up all over the cavern grounds. Thick streams of lava trickled down its walls, pooling on the grounds, seeping through the cracks back into the beating heart of the earth. The whole cavern was riddled with glowing red cracks. More formed each time the monster at its center took a step.\par
Brimstone Drake (Monster) \par
Level 57\par
It was the size of a small barn, with scales the color of molten rock. Its deep-red eyes burned like smoldering coals. Looking at it, you got an impression of immense density. Smoke trickled out from its nostrils. Its eyes drifted lazily. It seemed not to notice them. The illusion worked.\par
Behind it, shimmering with its hoard, a glut of essence stones—a mound of it stacked so high it was halfway to the ceiling. Scattered about it were all kinds of shiny things: trinkets, lockets, goblets, daggers, dented shields, dented helms… He couldn't make out all of it through the fog, but he could tell—there's a lot more gold and silver lurking in the back. What caught his eye, though, was the crowning jewel of the hoard: this red translucent crystal, burning so hot it seemed to warp the air. It was made a weird red glass. A fire burned inside of it, flickering vivid yellow, white, and red…\par
Somehow that thing called to him. It stirred something hot in his heart… \par
Later. First, the Drake. He gave it a once-over with Sage Mind.\par
Brimstone Drake (Monster) \par
Level 57\par
Key Skills:\par
Molten Breath (Active) [Common]\par
Unleashes a stream of tar and lava from its maw.\par
Obsidian Hide (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Its skin hardens like obsidian, significantly increasing defense against physical attacks. Grants the Drake imperviousness to low-level fires.\par
…\par
"It's Fire-breathing," he told her. "And its skin is pretty much impenetrable."\par
Are you just guessing, or…?"\par
"My signature skill," he said. "I can also tell its weaknesses."\par
“Ooh, do tell."\par
They lit a braid all along the Drake's body. The weaker it was, the redder it got. Its underbelly was just a pale red. Its joints a little redder. Its eyes even more. But the reddest—“\par
“The inside of its mouth. It’s weakest there by far.”\par
"Gotcha," muttered Avery. "So I'll bait it into opening its mouth, and…you try fitting your axe through?"\par
He nodded. \par
As though they'd planned it, they dashed off at the same time—in opposite directions. The fog followed Zane, covering him as he ran, but it was moving too fast, unnaturally fast. Anytime now the Drake would catch on—\par
A roar trembled the chamber. The Drake's head snapped to the mouth of the cavern. Where Avery had been standing a moment ago, another Drake was emerging, swooping out into the open, black tar dribbling from its massive, craggy mouth, smoke billowing from its nostrils. He could see a flush of bright orange down its wide-open mouth. Fire was coming.Stolen story; please report.\par
The fake Drake—Avery’s illusion—roared again, just as loud, a challenge.\par
It worked. The Brimstone Drake sat up straighter, posturing to match the fake Drake. Zane had his chain at the ready. He only had eyes for its mouth. The Brimstone Drake roared back—\par
Zane threw. His axe ripped through the air and slashed into the mouth of the Drake, biting into reams and reams of thick muscle, lodging deep in skull bone. The Drake's head jerked back, its roar choked off. But just when they tried to shove his axe on through and finish the job, the Drake’s massive jaws clamped down and crushed the axe in place. Then it whipped its head and the axe went flying. Blood spurted out its mouth. Its eyes flicked to Zane. It was furious.\par
Shit. \par
There wasn't enough space to get in deep where they wanted—he had to get the mouth wider.\par
Before the Brimstone Drake could do anything, the other Drake roared again. Somehow even louder, even more piercing, and this time the sound came with a burst of brilliant flame. \par
Then it started to charge, lumbering, picking up speed fast, dripping gobs of tar everywhere. Its Jaw unhinged wide, going straight for the Brimstone Drake's throat. It came so fast, so furiously, it was almost impossible not to look at it. It felt so real. Zane wasn’t even the one being charged, and he almost looked. \par
Tar spilling from the Brimstone Drake’s lips, smoke gurgling from its nostrils. It swerved around, moving to answer with a blast of its own—\par
This time Zane timed it. He could tell the thing had caught on. It was loading its Molten Breath in its throat. It was trying not to open its mouth until it had to. It knew what Zane wanted to do now. When it opened its mouth to rinse the fake Drake, it probably figured even if Zane tried again the sheer flow of tar pouring out its mouth would shove the Axe right out its mouth. \par
And it was right—except…\par
This time Zane threw the axe before it even opened its mouth. He watched the fake Drake’s charge, watched the real Drake’s body language. And timed it just right. That the moment the boss opened its mouth his Axe lodged clean into the roof of the mouth. \par
The Drake screeched, bit down. Its molten breath poured out.\par
But the axe stayed put.\par
Zane hadn't thrown that axe to kill it. He hadn’t thrown that axe to go deep. Zane had thrown it in a very particular orientation, for a very particular purpose. Vertically. He'd thrown it so it’d get stuck just behind the Drake's upper teeth, and when the Drake tried clamping down, all it did was cut itself with the axe’s other side. \par
Blood fountained everywhere. The Drake let out a monstrous cry of pain. It kept trying to close its mouth, it kept hurting itself, the axe was lodged tight. A neat little wedge. \par
Then Zane fed his other axe down its open throat. It choked. Its hateful red eyes bulged. Its serpent-like neck thrashed here and there, it trembled, it spasmed.\par
Then it fell over. And died.\par
Brimstone Drake has been slain!\par

He looked over at Avery. Avery looked back at him. They both seemed astounded.\par
Just like that?\par
They had surgically targeted its weakness. And then ambushed it. It made sense. Still, though…\par
That's it?\par
“Yes!” Avery dashed over to him. She seemed very excited. “Dude, that was awesome! High five!”\par
“What?” He said. “That was way too easy.” \par
Avery just blinked at him. “Huh?” \par
“You said the second floor was much harder than this?”\par
“… yeah?”\par
“Good,” he grunted. “We’ll see.” \par
She looked so baffled standing there with her hands still up. He felt a little bad. So he sighed, and high-fived her, and moved to inspect the hoard they just earned.\par
“Wait, you want it to be harder?” she called.\par
“…”\par
“There's something wrong with you, you know that?”\par
*** \par
The hoard looked just like he'd imagined a dragon's hoard would look, but instead of gold coins, they were glowing white crystals. Normal essence stones burned dimly, but these glowed like pale moons on a dark night. Apparently, they were ten times as strong. The only problem was carrying them—he'd supposed they'd have to leave most of it here and come back for it once this was a safe zone.\par
Avery was picking through the pile, cooing over random shiny trinkets. When he inspected them, he saw they were mostly useless: cursed amulets, pendants, dented helms, broken daggers. \par
“I knew it,” she said.\par
“What?” \par
“I had a good feeling the moment I saw you,” she said, grinning. “I knew we’d go well together. I’ve been in teams before. They can’t keep up. You’re different.” \par
It felt absurd to think, but they did arguably too well. That was only kind of fun. Two Signed on one team might be too much. That second floor… he’d better find a real challenge down there. \par
Then she gasped.\par
“It's a bag of holding!”\par
Bag of Holding (E)\par
Stores a pocket dimension within, allowing its owner to carry an inventory of objects without the burden of their space or weight. At E-grade, this treasure can store approximately 57 feet by 57 feet by 57 feet of space.\par
So a pocket inventory. Maybe they could make out with some of the stuff after all. Not all the stones, but a good chunk. And whatever trinkets here were worth taking. \par
“These are pretty common drops in D-ranked dungeons,” said Avery. “Must’ve been left behind by one of those adventurers. A lot of them have them. Hey—ever notice something strange? Some of these things—” She pointed at an F-grade rusted steel dagger—“Are way too old. I know for a fact there weren't this many parties stomping around the place before I got here."\par
Zane knew what she meant. That Cavern of Insight with the sword slashes… there was no way that was done by a human expert. At least… not someone like him. Not something from here.\par
“You think these are fake?” He said. “Dungeon generated?” \par
“Seems kind of odd to make them seem so real-seeming though, doesn’t it?” Avery chewed on her lip. "Nah. I bet these are real, just not from here. I bet it's like… the system has this giant inventory of all kinds of cool shit, and it just tosses some down when it makes a dungeon. And it includes stuff it got from dungeons too. So it recycles.” \par
She reached into the bag.\par
“There's stuff in here—”\par
She yanked something out. A scroll, like something straight out of the collection of an ancient Chinese emperor. Its ends were topped with gold. \par
Whispering Wind Steps (C) \par
Prequisites: At least 2 Major Laws of the Elemental Law of Wind\par
Teaches the Rare Skill: Whispering Wind Steps. This tome is a heritage treasure of Planet Thalen’s Green Clouds Faction. \par
C-Grade? Two Major Laws as the Prequisites?\par
“What the fuck?” said Avery. He was thinking the exact same thing. \par
“Planet Thalen?” Zane blinked. “There’s other planets?” \par
Avery looked at him funny. “Of course. That’s old news. This is C-Grade, dude! The Hell’s it doing in a dump like this?” \par
“Don’t know,” he said. “But neither of us can use it. You know any Wind Laws?” \par
She shook her head. “I wonder how much the Beacon shop would trade for it, though…” \par
They decided they’d figure out what to do with it later. He offered to cash it in with the Beacon, then split whatever they got, but she shook her head. \par
 \par
“Nah. I’m one of yours now, remember? Use it for the Faction. Wait…” She slapped her head. “Forgot to request it. Here—” \par
Avery Lively requests to join the Luminous Faction (E) \par
Accept? (Y/N) \par
He did. \par
Avery Lively (Creature) \par
Essence Level 50\par
Class: Spectral Seeker\par
Faction: Luminous Faction \par
“Alright!” She grinned her crooked grin. “Now you’re stuck with me.” She went back to scavenging. \par
He turned his sights to the treasure on the top of the stack, the treasure that’d caught his attention the instant he set foot in the room. That red translucent crystal with the fire burning deep within… up close, he could see those distortions around it weren’t heat waves. They looked like his fires. \par
Those were distortions of Law. \par
\par


\section{32. Mount Saint Helens (VII) }
\par
He scanned it with Identify.\par
Volcanic Heart (D)\par
The Volcanic Heart is forged under millennia of heat and pressure within the magma flows of a volcano. It has witnessed untold eruptions and carries their secrets within. Its fire holds the essence of Eruption. Holding this item grants the user an increased affinity to Fire Laws. \par
He felt Laws rolling off it, warming his soul. He felt a kinship with it. But strangely, it also felt like those sword lashes in the Cavern of Insight. He felt close to it. Just not close enough in his soul in a way that was difficult to describe. Just a feeling.\par
To comprehend a Law, he had to find it in the world, and also himself. He saw it here, preserved under glass. But he didn't know was what Eruption meant to him personally.\par
"Whoa…" Avery came over. "Is that a Law treasure? Yeah, that's rare as hell. That Drake was loaded."\par
"How do you use this?”\par
“You have to experience it. This one… yeah, Eruption. You have to experience eruption. You have to know it really deeply.”\par
“So I have to… erupt?” What did that even mean?\par
“You have to erupt. A lot." She nodded.\par
"Hmm," he said.\par
She had a weird look on her face.\par
"What?"\par
"I'm trying very hard," she said slowly, “Not to say an inappropriate joke.”\par
A pause. “Okay, okay. I’m good. Anyway, it’ll probably take a while to learn. You'll meditate on it, slip into a trance eventually, let it connect with your soul… something like that. I got a Shard of Balance once, and it took two straight days of meditating before I got a vision out of it. It's a bit of an out-of-body experience. When I came back, I could balance my whole body on a toe. Fun stuff! But it takes a while."\par
She tucked a lock of hair behind an ear. "You should probably do it after we finish off this dungeon," she said. “You'll be inside a volcano soon, so it'll probably get you some of the way there already. But more important, the second floor unblocked as soon as the first is cleared. Which means you bet your ass Stroud's already heading for it. We should get going.”\par
They stuffed the most useful treasures there in the Bag of Holding and left. Avery said to keep the Heart of the Volcano on him—even just having it near could help comprehension. So he zipped it in his shorts pocket. \par
\par
The rest they’d come back for later. \par
***\par
As it turned out, Avery was spot on.\par
She led him to the second floor entrance: a giant cave mouth carved into the slope of the mountain proper. It was so big you could fly a plane down it. So big every little gust of wind that went in was thrown back in echoes a hundredfold. Its walls were studded with torches flickering with ghostly essence light. Streams of lava dripped down the front, coiling down miles and miles from the mountain peak. You had to be careful not to get burned going in. This close to the mountain, the ground was riddled with lava flows. Tar bubbled everywhere.\par
Avery said that before the first floor was cleared, this place had been sealed by a blue wall. Now there was nothing stopping them from going down.\par
Nothing except the clump of white dots drawing close, and fast.\par
Stroud and his troops had had the same idea. Avery and Zane came in from the east side. They came in from the West. Neither seemed interested in stopping for the other.\par
They were about to collide.\par
Victor Stroud marched toward them. He was flanked by two rows of stone-faced men. They drew near at the cave entrance and stopped there, facing each other.\par
Stroud’s face was set in a deep grimace, like he was in physical pain. He looked a little nauseated.\par
For a moment, neither side said anything. Victor spoke first. His voice was clipped and harsh.\par
"You've grown fast,” he said to Zane. "In two days, you have reached Level 52… and you've cleared the Drake as well. You are to be… congratulated.”\par
He spoke the words through gritted teeth, like he had to pry them out of his mouth. He was saying the words, but they didn’t show in his face. His eyes still held Zane in contempt.\par
"You have...potential, Savage Sage," Stroud continued. "It must be admitted. With the right resources, the right support, and disciplined fighting men to do your bidding, you could be a great power in your own right."\par
Zane was getting whiplash. Hadn’t they tried to kill him just a day ago?\par
"The Soldier of God prizes men of potential. He believes it a shame to see such men wasted. He sent me a missive. You must forgive me for my… hastiness… yesterday. The Soldier has commanded I apologize."\par
It wasn’t much of an apology. It seemed to kill Stroud a little to say it. It did explain how he was acting. Zane supposed it said something about this Soldier.A case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.\par
"Savage Sage, I have an offer to make you. It is from the Soldier himself. The Luminous Faction may join the Iron Legion as a sub-faction. Your Faction will be granted near full autonomy. They will be treated well and given Iron Legion protection, and need only pay a small tribute. You will be gifted five high-grade Spirit Stones. Enough to raise you to Level 60. And… you will personally earn a place as one of the Soldier's Lieutenants—a high honor. Equal to my own rank.”\par
He spat out that last phrase.\par
“I see," said Zane evenly.\par
"This way," continued Stroud, “We gain a useful ally. And you, and your people, stand to gain as well. Everyone wins. There need not be any bloodshed."\par
“You are implying," said Zane, “That if I do not take your offer, there would be bloodshed."\par
Stroud frowned.\par
"The Soldier is intent on claiming the Pacific Northwest as his own," said Stroud. “The Soldier recognizes your talents. Yet… if you are not an ally, then you must be an enemy. And you will suffer the same fate as all the Legion's enemies."\par
Zane said nothing.\par
“This is the best offer we have given any Faction in the state," said Stroud.\par
More generous than Zane deserved, if Stroud’s face was anything to go by. “Consider it carefully. There will not be another."\par
Avery was looking at him with some alarm. "Hey, big fella," she said. "Um. You're not… actually considering this… right?"\par
"Ah. Yes,” said Stroud, blinking like he’d just remembered she was there. "This raises a final point.”\par
He pointed straight at Avery. “This woman has wreaked devastation on his territories and terrorized his people. She is a wanted criminal. As part of our deal, the Soldier requests your aid in her execution."\par
A tense silence fell. Avery bit her lip.\par
"I refuse."\par
Stroud's face darkened. "This is a condition of our offer."\par
“Then I refuse that too."\par
Stroud twitched. He stared in disbelief, as though he couldn’t believe Zane had the audacity. "Do you understand what it means to be an enemy of the Soldier, Savage Sage? Of those above Level 60, he has dozens. The Soldier himself is well over Level 70! This is not a battle you can hope to win! He has offered you exceedingly generous terms! You would throw them in his face?”\par
“He wants me to submit to him,” said Zane. “You call that generous? You don't threaten one of my own in front of me. I don’t trust you, nor do I trust your offer.”\par
He shrugged. "And I don't like you. You tried to kill me a day ago. Now you want to be my ally?”\par
A vein bulged in Stroud’s forehead. “You would be a fool to spurn us, Savage Sage!”\par
"So be it," said Zane calmly.\par
Stroud breathed out deeply. He’d gone dark red. “Know this! As an enemy, considering your strength, your Signature, and your rate of growth—you are the greatest threat we perceive in this region. You will have gone from a great friend to our greatest enemy. If you are determined to go down this route… the Legion will treat you as such.”\par
“So be it,” said Zane again.\par
Stroud glared at him. Then he turned to Avery.\par
"You then, Savant! This man is determined to make an enemy of the Soldier, but you need not. Help us subdue him. Leave the state. Then, the Soldier is prepared to grant you amnesty."\par
Zane was almost impressed by the sheer gall of the man. Cold-blooded as a snake, this one.\par
"Hmm," said Avery. She cocked her head. "Go fuck yourself?"\par
Stroud looked from one of them to the other, his face a mask of cold fury. "You will regret this. Both of you!”\par
He started marching off.\par
"Wait," said Zane suddenly. "Did you mean what you said? That you mean to conquer us?”\par
Stroud turned slowly. “That is so."\par
"So you've come and threatened my people, and declared me a threat to be exterminated. And you believe you can simply… walk away?" An amused smile was creeping up Zane's face.\par
Stroud looked like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “I chose not to fight you," he said through gritted teeth. "Because that might mean losing men. And losing men jeopardizes my chances of clearing this dungeon. But do not think for a second I fear you, you insolent brat.”\par
Electricity crackled around his eyes. For a second, they flashed lightning blue. "If it is a fight you want, you will have one!"\par
But it wasn't Zane who'd picked this fight. The moment Stroud had threatened Avery, threatened Zane's people to his face, he’d known this could end only one way. This strange, annoying girl was now his friend. So were the rest of the people of the Luminous Faction.\par
When Stroud threatened Zane he’d only been mildly annoyed. His life didn’t feel all that important. But somehow when they threatened his friends it pissed him off. He wasn’t sure why there was such a difference, but there it was.\par
Zane didn't look to Stroud. He looked to Stroud's men, looked each one dead in the eyes. "Before we begin, I'll give your leader the same offer he gave me. Give him up, and I'll spare you."\par
None of them hesitated. They drew their sole weapons, all at once.\par
So be it.\par
Victor Stroud (Creature)\par
Essence Level 56\par
Class: Lightning Lord\par
Laws: Minor Law of Discharge\par
Key Skills:\par
Stormbreaker (Active) [Common]\par
Strikes with the force and power of a lightning bolt, stunning the enemy and dealing massive damage. Electric power scales with level.\par
Stormguard (Passive) [Uncommon]\par
Envelopes the Lightning Lord in a constant field of electricity which significantly bolsters the speed and power of the Lord’s attacks, and repels the strikes of the Lord’s enemies.\par
Zane could work with that.\par
Stroud held out a hand, and lightning struck his palm. When the flash faded, there was a weapon—a 10-foot-long glaive. Its blade was one curved, viciously sharp chunk of blue steel; lightning crackled down its length. You could hear the buzzing from dozens of feet away.\par
Roaring a battle cry, Stroud charged. His underlings did too.\par
"I need you to hold Stroud," said Zane. His Axes burst into being. "I'll clear his underlings first." Avery nodded. "On it!"\par
A minor mirage burst into being around Stroud, trapping him. Zane imagined he was falling down some unseen dimension in that cocoon. He had maybe 10 seconds.\par
Inferno Cyclone!\par
His Axes shrieked out. In just two revolutions, the trees around them crumbled to nothing. The ground started to warp. Drifts of ash were dragged into the howling air currents. Stroud's men tried chucking their skills at him, tried charging him, but they all met that wall of fire and wind. They were all swallowed up. His axes spun a fourth, a fifth time. They raced through the ranks of men. Blood and fire stained the cyclone red. Screams erupted through the mess, but the winds drowned them out. Essence flashed. Limbs rolled. Heads rolled. Body halves flopped over one another, twitching.\par
Stroud broke out just in time to see the last of his men dissolve into essence and flow straight into Zane.\par
Stroud twitched. His eyes bulged. Angry veins stood out, purple on his neck, on his head. But he didn't lunge. Instead, he took a deep breath, and a trembling, furious coldness settled over his expression.\par
"You'll die for that!” he snarled.\par
His glaive flashed white, and he leapt. Zane swung up his axes to meet the man. Lightning met fire. A blue-white blast rocked the world, and they were both sent stumbling back, breathing hard.\par
Screaming, Stroud lunged again, and again they met—axe and glaive—and again they burst apart. Zane was starting to smile. Avery raised her hands, the air began to distort—\par
"Don't!" said Zane.\par
"What?"\par
"Stay out of it," he said. He was full-on grinning now. "This one's mine."\par


\section{33. Mount Saint Helens (VIII)}
\par
\par
Stroud came at Zane like a demon. He struck to kill. The glaive flashed for his throat, down for his belly, tried skewering him in the eyes, one strike crackling into another at a brutal pace. \par
But Zane could fight like that too. When the glaive shot up, he brought his Chains to block. The glaive came low, and he wrapped its handle as it passed, forcing Stroud to jerk it out before Zane wrenched it from his grasp. \par
Zane countered. He swept his in a furious arc as though to cleave Stroud clean in two. Axes met glaive, and blew apart, and came together again. Each clash was a blinding explosion.\par
He was surprised to find when they clashed head-on Stroud was the one who caved first. Zane was stronger! \par
After that Drake fight, Zane realized something. He’d been underestimating himself.\par
The higher Level he got, the more rare Skills he got, the more rare Classes he got… the greater the difference between men like Stroud and men like him. Even just jump from Chain Reaver to Infernal Mauler was massive.\par
This Lightning Lord class of Stroud's was likely an Uncommon class. Solid. Good, even. \par
But the difference between that and what Zane had, between Stroud's Titles and Skills and Zane’s own… It easily bridged the Level difference. \par
As he was now, Zane was confident common man at his Level—or even close to it—could stand with him. It took someone special. Someone like Avery. \par
Stroud was starting to realize it too. Zane ripped into him again and again. And each time the Axe blasted aside the glaive, each time Stroud had to leap back or bend, throw up a desperate skill to blast away his Axe. Zane was the one putting a pace on him now. He came faster and faster, ripped through Stroud's defenses with disrespectful ease. \par
Stroud's moves were getting herky-jerky. He was starting to stumble. His eyes got wide, sweat beaded down his brow. He was getting desperate. He had that one Skill in his back pocket: Stormbreaker. He must’ve been saving it for just the right time.\par
So Zane gave it the chance. He swung his Axes a little too wide, missed the mark, and went stumbling over himself. For a second, his entire backside was exposed. He felt the electric shift in the air, he felt Stroud lunging—\par
He ducked. Stroud flew over him. The glaive’s head was a star, crackling with lightning so bright it hurt to look at, but Stroud had lunged too hard. He was a victim of his own momentum. He only realized mid-lunge that Zane's Axes were swerving around behind him.\par
The Axe-heads dug deep into his thick back. Two fiery explosions rocked Stroud’s body. He screamed.\par
A spasm of lightning sent Zane's Axes flying, but the damage was done. Stroud stumbled over, teeth clenched, eyes wild. He looked like a cornered animal.\par
Next time he lunged, he fought like an animal too. No more careful, clean strikes. No defending. He didn't care if Zane caught him with another Axe blow. He just wanted Zane's head. He fought Zane the way a drowning man claws for air.\par
It kind of worked. He landed a couple of times, clean, two down Zane's chest, a few scrapes up his arms. Enough for—\par
Warning: Health under 50\%!\par
But not enough to beat him. Not even close.\par
Soon Stroud stumbled back a bloody mess, heaving in deep gulps of air. His eyes bulged wildly. “How?!” he croaked. “How are you doing this?!” \par
Zane grinned bloodily. And went for his head.\par
Stroud chucked his glaive like a spear. Zane blocked with his Chains. There was a blinding flash as lighting cracked uselessly against dark steel. \par
When it cleared, he saw Stroud's backside receding against the dull gray sky. The coward ran!\par
Zane chucked his Axes right after. But before they could catch him, he went splat. \par
 Just flattened against a stretch of sky. Zane blinked as the illusion peeled away, revealing the stark black face of the mountainside.\par
Then his Axes caught up, and finished off Stroud for good: one thudded into his back, the other into the back of his neck.\par
He looked to Avery, who gave him a sheepish grin. "Look, I know you said he was yours and all, but dude’s pretty fast. He was really going for it. Might’ve gotten away."\par
He was still breathing heavily, heaving in gulps of air. She considered him. "Well," she said, "you just kicked the hornet's nest. Now they'll really start coming for you."\par
"Let them," he said. He licked his lips. "Next time, I hope they bring someone stronger."\par
“… Dude, you're weird, you know that?”\par
*** \par
They started down the tunnel to the second floor. It was a massive and dimly lit, void of life. Just pure black, pockmarked rock going on and on. They must have walked for half an hour, maybe an hour. This went deep into the heart of the volcano. The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.\par
“Random thought,” said Avery. “I wonder what it's all for. Like…” she gestured around them, at the cavern, at the ghostly torches bolted to the walls, “All this. Can’t be natural, right? Someone made this—someone designed this."\par
"Maybe."\par
"But why? Don’t you ever think about it?"\par
"No."\par
A silence.\par
"It's just… there's a lot of weird stuff. I don't know, like, there's no non-combat classes. Isn't that weird? We have to rely on the Beacon store for everything. Food, shelter… and the only way we get stuff we need is by killing. Monsters, or each other. Like. There has to be a reason, right?” \par
“Hmm.”\par
“Aliens made this. I mean, this—" she waved around the C-grade manual—"says Planet Thalen. There’s definitely aliens, and they must’ve designed it this way. But they haven’t, like… made first contact? They just threw the System at us and said, ‘Here, have at it!’ Like they're just waiting for us to duke it out.”\par
“Eh.” Zane was pretty happy with how things were going. He saw no need to question it.\par
“Maybe it’s like… a training tool? Or maybe it’s like a prison for monsters, and it’s using us to kill them? …You don't care, do you?” said Avery, looking up at him. "You just want to hit things."\par
He shrugged. “Pretty much.”\par
She grinned, punching him playfully. “You big lump!”\par
He could tell she was still chewing on it as they went deeper and deeper. At some point, the torches stopped. The ground flattened out. There were little breakages in it, little veins of magma here and there. The farther they went, the more there were. Eventually there was no need for torchlight. The ground was like a tortoise shell. Light from magma buried in the cracks streamed up, giving the pitch-black walls a red sheen. Steam vents popped up here and there, hissing. The air smelled of burning.\par
“I think we're near the start,” said Avery.\par
They'd come across a crossroads. One tunnel led left, the other right. On the left side, the ground somehow got even blacker, the cracks between deep red, like dried blood. That route was smoky, murky. It smelled of brimstone. The mini-map read—Brimstone Region.\par
On the right path, lava spilled everywhere. Lava flowed down the walls, crisscrossed the chambers. There were rivers of it, sometimes open pools. You had to cross a lava minefield just to get across the chamber. That path led to the Molten Region.\par
Presumably, left was where the Brimstone Titan lived, right the Molten Phoenix.\par
Avery looked at him. "Flip a coin?"\par
He just went right, shrugging. She followed. Molten Region it was. \par
On the mini-map, the chambers down this route were much wider. They just opened up into these great dark halls of stones. The ceiling drooped with stalagmites which looked like giant ash icicles. You could probably fit a small mountain into the chamber—it had its own craggy landscape. Natural rock formations littered the place. Steam vents hissed here and there. And through it all, across it all, off the walls, down the paths flowed streams upon streams of gurgling lava.\par
This was not normal lava, he realized. It shone brighter. There was essence in this fueling its burn.\par
He knelt down to inspect a nearby stream. Then a burning hand shot out of it, and he jerked back. He blinked, took another step back as the monster climbed onto land. It looked like if a bonfire in human form. Two arms, two legs, no face, just fire.\par
Flame Wraith (Monster)\par
Level 46\par
It blitzed him. He hacked at it with his Axe, but it seemed not to care—it got cut in two, the halves became little flame wraiths of their own—a little less bright—and kept dashing at him.\par
He swept at it with his Chains. Nimbly they hopped over. Avery cried out. They crashed straight into him.\par
Warning: Health under 75\%\par
“…” \par
“Are you OK?”\par
"Pretty much," he said. \par
As they walked, they steered clear of the streams. A few more came lunging at him, but he chopped them quickly and brushed them off. They were tiny by the time they got to him, and barely put a dent in him.\par
A few came for Avery, and she shamelessly hid behind him and let him take care of them. “Can't you roll them off or something?" he said, exasperated. \par
"Yeah, but they still burn me a little. Same goes with lightning. Or any force, really. I redirect stuff, but I still kind of touch it. It stings!"\par
"It stings me too. A lot."\par
"Yeah, but there's more of you. You're a big boy. You can take it." She patted him encouragingly on the back.\par
“…”\par
So far, nothing truly concerning popped out at them. They were heading for the northwest corner of this chamber, it was marked a Treasure Area. At some point along the way, Avery got curious about one of the spires and climbed to the top to check it out. As it turned out, what she thought was a boulder at the top was actually a monster. A ‘Cinder Raven’ that looked just like a giant rock when its wings were furled. They still looked mostly like giant rocks when their wings unfurled, just angry, winged rocks with deep-set red eyes.\par
They chased her all the way down the spire.\par
“Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it!” she cried at him. He did. It was Level 49 and it scored a nasty wound down his middle with its rake of a beak. From then on, Avery covered them with a moving cloud of smog as they went. They saw flocks of Cinder Ravens roosting on the craggy peaks, but the smokescreen worked.\par
"You should learn an offensive skill," Zane told her. Running from these things seemed a little sad to him. She pulled her hoodie over her ears, all sheepish. “… Yeah…”\par
They were coming up upon the treasure area when Avery grabbed him and yanked him to a halt. “Shit!” Then she doubled the thickness of their smokescreen, so thick he could scarcely see the path ahead.\par
“What are you doing?”\par
“You'll see,” she said.\par
About ten strides later, the treasure area came fully into his mini-map’s viewing radius, and he did. \par
It was one huge splotch of red. So many stacked together he couldn’t pick out the individual Monsters. They came upon it slowly, cautiously. \par
The treasure area was a giant pool of light orange-yellow lava. Or, rather, the thing at the center of it, pouring into it—a giant waterfall of lava. Lava-fall? At first he thought what he was feeling was the heat of it—and there was a lot of that. But hotter, stronger… he felt the essence just gushing off that thick flow. It made a deep-throated rumble as it poured over. \par
A single path ran out to the center, right under the fall—where it poured into the lava lake. \par
 Crucible of the Volcano (D) \par
A lava-fall which runs from the heart of the Volcano, teeming with its purest, most potent essence. Beware: to experience its flow is also to feel its burn on both the body and the soul. The latter is far more difficult to endure than the former. The rare few who can stand its flow gain the hyper-condensed essence of the volcano itself.\par
‘The rare few who can stand its flow’? That read like a challenge to Zane. \par
He would’ve gone for it instantly if not for those mini-map dots. \par
If he had to guess… under the surface lay hundreds upon hundreds of Flame Wraiths. \par
Could be tricky. \par
\par


\section{34. Mount Saint Helens (IX)}
\par
\par
They stared at the bubbling lava pool.\par
“So…” said Avery, puffing out a cheek. “Same strat? I bait, you whack?”\par
“I’ll need some time to set up the Cyclone. Once they're sucked in it should line them up. Then…” He made a slashing gesture.\par
“Sounds good to me.” Avery squinted at him. “Hmm…”\par
“What are you doing?”\par
“Memorizing you,” she said. \par
She snapped her fingers, and another him burst into being right next to her. It looked just like him. Eerily so—down to the lines of the face. \par
…Was his face really so dour all the time? \par
“Neat, right?” said Avery. “Here, look!”\par
Fake Zane started walking around. Rather, lumbering around.\par
“I don't walk like that,” said Zane. He paused. “… Do I?”\par
Then fake Zane bent over and leapt into a handstand. He started walking around on his hands. Avery giggled.\par
“…”\par
Fake Zane got to his feet and made a goofy grin. He struck a bodybuilder pose. “Aww,” said Avery, “Isn't he cute? Who's my good boy?” She ruffled fake Zane's hair.\par
Then, still grinning, she looked at Zane's very unamused face. “Uh… right.” She cleared her throat. “Sorry. Let's get started?”\par
“Let's,” said Zane dryly.\par
She snapped again.\par
And fake Zane went sprinting toward the lake, screaming and hollering and flapping his arms like a man on fire. Which he might very well be soon. The Flame Wraiths instantly took notice. The edges of the lake started bubbling. When he got close, a horde of them leapt out and lunged for him, spewing sparks. He sprinted along the lava fall's perimeter, and wherever he went, Flame Wraiths shot out at him, grabbing for his ankles, his legs, but he always found some little acrobatic trick to get out of the way. He stuck out his tongue. He made stupid faces. It seemed to enrage them.\par
He kept running, and the whole lake started to tremble. Zane started twirling his Axe. By the time his wind was picking up, it looked like the whole lake was erupting at once. There were so many Wraiths pouring out it was shifting the balance of the magma. Magma sloshed, spilling over the banks. \par
Fake Zane kept running. He was three-quarters of the way round the lake, and the stampede behind him was getting monstrous. Zane couldn't even count how many there were—just a thick press of tiny flaming people. \par
“Here it comes!” said Avery.\par
His winds were so loud by now he almost didn’t hear her. The Wraiths flowed in, and the winds snatched them up one by one. They were thrown up in clumps, spinning higher and higher, and so many were pouring in now it actually grew unwieldy, hard to keep straight. Zane was flailing a little. He could hardly distinguish the Wraiths from his own fires. He had to start cutting them down, and fast, or it’d all fall apart.\par
The winds drew in close, lining them up, and the Axes started their nasty work. They raked one clean line straight up and down the rows, cleaving 20 or 30 at once, then doubled back and ripped through another clump, then another. It was shocking how many there were, even more, more than he could’ve imagined, all screeching bloody murder at him. Two more rakes, and he'd slashed most of them down to size.\par
The problem was in that time, a huge clump had managed to claw their way to him. He couldn't dodge. He could only grit his teeth as the first few came through and dive-bombed him.\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
Then another, then another, and his front side lit up in pain. \par
Warning: Health under 50\%!\par
Shit. There were too many more, maybe a half dozen, and they were too close to stop. He couldn't hold them like this. He had to— \par
Avery walked in front of him. She flowed right through the scything Cyclone currents, slipped between the edges of his Axes, so easily it was like she was walking through a still photograph. Everything just slipped off her. Her face was scrunched tight in concentration. And as the Wraiths came for him, she took them all, one by one, and flung them back deep into the raging winds.\par
His Axes took care of the rest.\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 52 -> 53\par
Skill Up!\par
Inferno Cyclone I -> II\par
He came out sweating and panting. He felt a little dizzy. Avery was in pretty much the same shape—her arms were bright red, the flesh had been burned off.\par
"You alright?” he said.\par
"I'm good! Just… a little tender."\par
He looked out at the lava falls pouring over a now-empty lake. “Want to try it first?”\par
"Hell no.” She grabbed her bag of holding and plopped herself down by the side of the pool. "I'm done getting burnt. Mind if I..?" She plucked out a handful of mid-grade essence stones. He shrugged, "Suit yourself."Unauthorized duplication: this tale has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\par
She closed her eyes and started healing, absorbing.\par
Which left him to try the lava-fall. He walked up the path, down the middle, came real close. It wasn't as loud as a heavy waterfall would’ve been. The flow was slower, but its sounds were much lower, reverberating, like they came from deep in the earth.\par
A lava-fall which runs from the heart of the Volcano, teeming with its purest, most potent essence. Beware: to experience its flow is also to feel its burn on both the body and the soul. The latter is far more difficult to endure than the former. The rare few who can stand its flow gain the hyper-condensed essence of the volcano itself.\par
Normal fires didn't burn him anymore. But the Laws running through this fire were higher than his own, at least major. Hmm.\par
He stuck out a hand, shoved it under the flow.\par
It scalded his flesh instantly. He felt a strong instinct to jerk away, like he just put his hand on a hot stove. When he removed it, he saw it hadn't been burned much at all. The skin was still there.\par
That burning feeling was in his mind. This lava scalded him twice at once, in flesh and in soul. He shoved his hand under the flow again and let it sit there, blinking at it. There it was again, that spike of heat, but the pain wasn't physical. All mental.\par
He observed the pain with an almost detached curiosity. After that first spike, it grew slowly, like it was bringing his mind to a boil, and held him there. It wasn't very comfortable. But it wasn't all that bad. \par
He took off his shirt, laid it out on the ground, and turned to sit down under the lava fall. He found Avery staring at him, wide-eyed.\par
"What?"\par
She blinked and jerked up. "Sorry! It's just… y’know…" she flapped a hand at him. “Abs.”\par
“…”\par
“What?” she said, blushing. “Stop judging me! What am I supposed to do, not look? How about I take off my shirt, and you try not staring?” \par
“…Let’s not.” \par
He sighed, turned, closed his eyes, and sat down into the rush. Instantly he felt it hammer him into the ground; he had to force his spine upright. All that dense molten steel pouring over him… He gritted his teeth. It did hurt a lot. His body and his soul. And yet…\par
He felt apart from it somehow. The pain was a feeling floating in his mind, just kind of… there. It grew steadily worse and then leveled off. It wasn't so bad. He kept sitting there, letting it wash over him. Even as it burned him, he felt its essence, dense as the flow itself, pouring all over his back, seeping through the skin.\par
Soon it was more interesting than it was painful. He'd reached a level of acute pain he'd never felt before. He lost himself to the sensation.\par
Soon,\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 53 -> 54\par
… That easy? He blinked. What had that been, like... three hours? \par
This was… broken. Far too broken. \par
He stood and waved to Avery. He had to share this. “Try it," he said. "It's free Levels."\par
"Really?"\par
"It won't damage you. Roll the fire off with your Laws. It’ll burn the soul, which hurts. But it's not so bad. It gave me a Level in three hours."\par
"Oh, wow."\par
She came over and frowned skeptically at it. “I don’t know…” \par
"Just try it."\par
So she did. The instant she sat down—"Fuck, fuck!”\par
"It's in your mind," he told her. "Yeah," she said through gritted teeth. "I know. FUCK!"\par
Ten minutes in, she shot to her feet. "Nope, I'm done."\par
He was just saying it's not so bad if you stick to it—when she pitched over on her face and vomited.\par
“…”\par
"I can feel when I'm about to black out, you big dummy. That sucked."\par
He was a little baffled. ‘Can’t you push through it?’\par
“It’s not even a willpower thing, it feels different,” she said. “Like a … soul power thing? Look, it doesn't work for me. It works for you because you're like a big hunk of rock! You don't feel things."\par
He frowned. He did feel things. But he didn’t bother correcting her.\par
“Anyway—I'm happy sticking to my essence stones. Thanks, though.” \par
He watched her go. Then—eh. He turned back and started sitting again.\par
A few hours later,\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 54 -> 55\par
And a few more...\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 55 -> 56\par
He didn't sleep. He grew obsessed with feeling himself fill up with that wonderfully dense essence. He was starting to like the pain. He was gaining Levels so fast it was dizzying.\par
In the end, he'd stayed there a full day. And in that time—\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 58 -> 59\par
Avery was content to wait for him. She didn't rush him. When he opened his eyes, she was still asleep. At least he thought it was her. She'd curled up into a ball and yanked the cords of her hoodie, so it was hard to tell.\par
Each time he Leveled up, the essence he needed ratcheted up a lot. That was five easy Levels, but he could sense it’d take maybe another week of sitting here to pour in another five.\par
Still… no wonder there’d been powerhouses in the 60s or 70s weeks ago. These higher-level dungeons were different.\par
He would have gladly kept sitting here, except somewhere midway through his fifth level, it dried up.\par
He blinked. Then he checked with identify.\par
Crucible of the Volcano is tapped out\par
Refill time: one month.\par
Aww.\par
…Somehow he got the feeling that wasn’t supposed to happen. The description made it sound like you were supposed to quit before the Volcano did. \par

He felt pumped up as he got to his feet, raring to go. Then he had a sudden thought, a thought that froze him still.\par
Avery was waking up, stretching, yawning. She blinked at him. "Jesus! Level 59?!” \par
"Was it too much?"\par
She stared on blankly.\par
"I think I did this in the wrong order," he explained. "I should’ve slain the bosses first."\par
"Why?"\par
"What if it's too easy now?"\par
“… I’m going to punch you.” \par
\par


\section{35. Molten Phoenix (I) }
\par
One day earlier\par
Seattle, WA\par
Iron Legion Headquarters\par
Marcus Blackwell, Signature Title: Soldier of God, convened his war council in his throne room. Its walls were a silver so deep they were almost black, curving up to high, vaulted ceilings ribbed with sharp steel beams. Floor-to-ceiling windows gazed out at a city darkened by storm clouds. The only other source of light was the ceiling: a stained glass window that let in bruised purple light.\par
He and his generals sat around a giant circular wood table. A map of Washington was laid out at its center. All of the north was shaded in gray, the color of the Legion. Most of the northeast was gray too. Tendrils of gray trickled steadily south.\par
This was how things were last week. The map would soon be a lot more colorful.\par
"Please, make yourselves comfortable," Marcus said, in his low, gravelly voice. He smiled broadly.\par
None of the four generals sitting around the table looked very comfortable. Then again, it was hard to be around a man like Marcus. Like taking your eyes off a starving tiger.\par
You wouldn't think so just looking at the man. In his public speeches he was all big smiles. He was Marcus the Great Protector, Marcus the Savior. The citizens of Seattle had heard it a hundred times before by now. In a world of monsters and dungeons, you needed a man like Marcus.\par
He even looked the part. He'd been big before the Change, but now he'd grown to a towering seven feet, thick with muscle, all square-jawed with a winning smile. He had Captain America looks on a huge Hulk body. He was Seattle’s perfect superhero.\par
That was how the world saw him—at least, the world under his rule. Marcus certainly saw himself like that. He projected that. But General Sullivan had known him since well before the Change. All the generals here had. So they were always a little uneasy.\par
"General Clay," said Marcus. "Kindly begin your report."\par
Clay licked his lips. He was a little rat of a man. Sullivan had never liked him, but he had a good eye for catching his enemies by surprise. Whatever you said about Marcus, he knew how to make use of people.\par
"The eastern campaign goes swimmingly," whispered Clay. He giggled. "We’re on the verge of victory. We've chased the Dawn Guard halfway down the state—oh, how they scurry! We have them at Mount Rainier. I have sicc’ed four lieutenants on them. They're under heavy siege. We’ll crush them this week, maybe tomorrow! I would bring you their heads as proof, sir, but … pity.”\par
“Very good.”\par
“Ah—and by this time, Lieutenant Stroud will taken that Savage Sage fellow into the fold. They ought to be enough to finish off Mt. St. Hellens. The east and the south are as good as ours!”\par
"Excellent," said Marcus. He had the strange way of smiling—the muscles of his face would make all the correct movements, but somehow it always seemed a little off. The eyes, Sullivan thought, just a little too intense to be real. Two pitiless black orbs boring into your soul when they looked at you.\par
They looked at Sullivan now, and Sullivan flinched. "General Sullivan," he said. “What do you have to report? Good news, I hope?"\par
Sullivan swallowed. But there was no getting away from it. The only thing the Soldier hated more than failures were liars. “We're deadlocked, sir, a few hundred miles into Canada,” he said gruffly. "The Harbor Masters are being difficult… it's the terrain. We're having trouble breaking the hold near Whistler. It’s—…"\par
Sullivan trailed off. Marcus was still staring at him. He wasn't smiling anymore, just staring.\par
Sullivan started to sweat. But he said quickly, "We'll break through before the month's end. I swear it, Sir. Just… a little more time."\par
Marcus was silent.\par
“I see,” he said at last. His voice was utterly flat. A pit dropped in Sullivan’s stomach. Before he could say more, though, there came a knock at the huge steel doors.\par
"Sir?" came a voice, high-pitched—young, trembling a little. "I have news—it's very important!"\par
"Oh?” said Marcus, and the moment passed. His voice warmed. The muscles in his face warped, contracted into a smile. “Come in."\par
The door cracked open, and a new recruit stepped through. Fresh uniform, hardly even broken in yet.\par
Every general around the table tensed.\par
It meant none of the usual messengers would deliver the message. Only a fresh face, someone who had never met Marcus—who only knew him second-hand—dared do it.\par
It said something about the message.\par
The messenger was just a boy, maybe 17 or 18, freckled, grinning this gap-toothed grin. He scurried up like he was coming to meet Santa.\par
“Sir, I’m Jacob, sir. Jacob Swalwell, private Jacob Swalwell. I just wanted to say, you're my hero, sir. I saw you going into the apartments alone, and clearing it when no one else would. My gramps lived there, sir, he had Alzheimer’s—you saved him!”This narrative has been purloined without the author's approval. Report any appearances on Amazon.\par
Marcus smiled. "Thank you, Jacob. My greatest hope is to inspire fine young men like you. Now, what’s this message you have for me?"\par
"Oh!" Jacob seemed to remember he’d come as a messenger, not a fanboy. "Err… it's Lieutenant Stroud, Sir, in Mount Saint Helens. His life crystal… it..."\par
He pulled it out. An active life crystal linked to its pair on someone's body would glow blue.\par
A broken one was dark. It meant its pair had stopped responding. It meant the person who wore it was dead.\par
Silence.\par
Marcus's face went utterly blank.\par
"Sir…?"\par
"Show me," he said slowly.\par
The boy sat the life crystal on the center of the table, and a projection rose over them all. The last scene the life crystal had sent over—the last scene the wearer saw.\par
Two people. One, a messy-haired girl in a hoodie. The generals flinched when they saw her. Marcus's jaw clenched, but his face didn't change.\par
Then there was a dark-haired man bathed in blood, two chains drooping at his sides, axes fixed to their ends. If Marcus was the hero of a story, this man could’ve been the villain.\par
They heard Stroud make his offer. They heard what this man said in response.\par
Then they watched him take Stroud apart. The last thing the crystal picked up—“Next time, I hope they bring someone stronger.”\par
A chill went down Sullivan’s spine.\par
The scene went dark.\par
"Uh, sir?" said Jacob. "You look a little—"\par
Marcus’s fist hit him so hard his skull caved in. Sullivan had heard people get hit brutally hard before—there was a cacophony of cracks as things broke: first their nose, then their orbital, then their jaw. Marcus hit the boy so hard there was just one huge shattering, like the crack of a bull whip. Every bone in his face broke at once.\par
He should’ve died instantly. But as his body went down Marcus buried another fist in his gut, then another, and blood burst out, splattering all over the room, splattering his fists, splattering his face. He screamed, bashing over and over and over again until the boy was far gone, turned to light, to nothing, and all he did was make new dents on the steel ground. New dents to go alongside the dozens of old ones littering the floor, running up the walls.\par
He turned to face the rest of them, and everyone went stock-still. "Clay," he snarled. "Take your men, all of them, the whole fucking eastern campaign—I want you south! I want you to greet that smug little bastard as he comes out of that fucking dungeon. I want him torn limb from fucking limb!”\par
Clay, the utter idiot, hesitated. “… Sir, all four divisions? Isn’t that a little overkill—”\par
Marcus started advancing on him and Clay fell off his seat, stammering, "Of course, of course! Immediately, sir, this very instant! I'll go personally. I’ll see it done, sir, I swear it!”\par
***\par
Zane was getting a little worried as they marched up to the boss chamber. The resistance they met was getting sad. A few good shots melted the Flame Wraiths that came at him, and the Cinder Ravens couldn't even get in a good peck at him now.\par
Maybe he had overdone it. He was practically one-shotting these things. That Phoenix better put up a real fight.\par
As they got close, Avery threw up her smokescreen. They were walking up a tunnel between chambers. The mini-map showed that the one ahead was the biggest chamber yet. It was speckled over with red dots. The biggest dot lay at its center.\par
"Ready?" said Avery, but he was already marching on through.\par
The tunnel opened up into a coal canyon—they stood at the canyon bottom. The top was too dim to be seen. The canyon walls were all coal. Lava streamed down their sides. Giant coal rock formations studded the landscape, towering dozens of feet high. Patches of smoke drifted about. The theme of the place was black, streaked red.\par
They looked up, saw a shadow drifting across. It was the biggest bird he'd ever seen like an eagle but made of the colors of fire, bright reds and yellows pouring into each other. Its tail feathers were long and beautiful, and constantly burning, leaving wisps of fire as it passed. It was a magnificent thing, artfully made.\par
Molten Phoenix (Monster)\par
Essence Level 65\par
Laws: \par
Minor Law of Eruption (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Minor Law of of Fiery Rebirth (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Key Skills:\par
Pyroclastic Screech (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Unleashes a high-pitched screech that disorients and damages enemies in a wide radius. The sound waves carry a wave of intense heat, dealing additional fire damage.\par
Wings of Fire (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Each beat of a Phoenix’s wings is a natural disaster. Chaining beat after beat, the Phoenix summons a hurricane of fire.\par
Phoenix Rebirth (Passive) [Rare]\par
Upon defeat, the Molten Phoenix bursts into flames and is reborn from its ashes. Each rebirth consumes essence from its Phoenix Core.\par
And all those other red dots had to be Cinder Ravens. Hundreds of them, some stacked on top of one another, spread across the tops of those rock formations.\par
"What's the plan?" said Avery.\par
"It's only Level 65," said Zane.\par
"Yeah, and?"\par
"Let me try it on my own. Don't interfere."\par
She looked at him like he was stupid. "You're stupid," she said.\par
"I know." He shrugged. "Let me be stupid once in a while. It's more fun."\par
"…Fine," she sighed. "But if you're literally about to die, I will pull you out.”\par
He nodded. "Drop the smoke."\par
Then he waded straight in.\par
He'd hardly taken ten steps when the tops of all those rock formations started to move, started to shift, unfurl. Hundreds of cruel red eyes narrowed on him.\par
He looked up, and saw the cruelest, biggest, reddest of them all had found him too—the Phoenix, perched on the highest tower of rock, staring down at him like a god.\par
Lair lock!\par
The Molten Phoenix has locked its lair\par
It screeched so loud it hurt.\par
Then all its minions leapt off their perches and dive-bombed him at once. He took out his Axes and spun with them. They came from all directions, diving top to bottom, making a natural funnel. Convenient. As he spun, he caught them one by one, and the blades started on their nasty work.\par
But he was still a little too slow. He saw a Level 53 diving fast at him, saw another Level 51 coming from the other side—too strong for his early winds to catch. They came in screeching and tore two huge bloody gashes down his side. Another followed in the tracks, then another—\par
Warning! Health under 75\%!\par
But as they tried swooping in for a second go, they found they couldn't.\par
The Axes got to a fifth, sixth, seventh spin, and now the wind was going so fast you could hear it howling down the length of the canyon, swirling around the rock towers, making them tremble. It plucked birds straight out of the sky and yanked them into a flaming death spiral. He laughed as his Axes raced up and down the cyclone, carving through rock, splitting Monster after Monster in clean halves. A few more squirmed their way through, got a few claw rakes on him, a few nasty pecks down his midsection, enough to scrape a hole in his belly, gushing blood. But that was all. He hardly felt it.\par
In seconds he’d already wiped out nearly three-quarters of them—just like that.\par
Christ. Maybe he was overleveled.\par
The Phoenix screeched a challenge.\par
It started beating its mighty wings.\par


\section{36. Molten Phoenix (II) }
\par
\par
It beat its wings and hot summer gales rushed down the canyon. The winds spun into each other, faster and faster, catching fire, until a little burning tornado sped down the canyon floor—and lost itself, petering out a hundred different ways, smoking to nothing. \par
The Phoenix beat its wings again, and another tornado took shape. Then again, and again, and again, and each beat birthed a new disaster. The volcanoes swirled around each other;  their gale-force winds tugged at each other, pulling each other in until they merged in violent flashes, one after another, growing bigger and bigger, a burning pyre of furious air. It towered up higher than any of the rocks, towered so high it spread halfway across the vast ceiling of the lair.\par
But Zane didn't sit idle. His attack was a lot alike. While the Phoenix spewed out as tornadoes he kept kept spinning his Axes, and his own Cyclone never stopped building. It grew scalding, incandescent with white flame, a broad wide piercingly bright saucer set against the Phoenix’s shrieking deep-red tower.\par
The two spun toward each other, slowly at first, then faster and faster as they drew near. The Phoenix screeched at Zane, spewing fire. Zane grinned back.\par
White fire met red fire.\par
And the red won. There was a brutal blast of heat, of air, and his Cyclone staggered, spun back, almost spun out of control. The sheer force of the clash—the sheer violence of it—crashed through the Cyclone winds and dashed itself on Zane's body. He felt like a fly swatted away. This wasn't burning he was used to—something huge and instantaneous, expiring all at once. A blast that racked his body.\par
He choked. He spat blood.\par
These were the Phoenix's Laws. The Laws of Combustion. The fire Laws that governed the incredible powers that lay dormant in Mount Saint Helens.\par
Warning: Health under 50\%!\par
Savage Body activated\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
At the same time, though, the tornado caught fire.\par
The red met the white, and the white spread over, started torching the red, started cannibalizing the red. Fire caught fire.\par
Combustion was fiercest at the moment of impact. But after? Well, Zane had two fire Laws, and the Phoenix only had one.\par
Slowly the Cyclone fought its way back. Zane stopped listening to his ears. There was nothing to hear—or rather, there was too much to hear. It was white noise voice cranked to maximum volume, painful and meaningless.\par
The edges of the tornado were almost all-white now, and Zane started pressing, waiting forward, grinning, baring teeth. The Phoenix fought harder, beat harder, and more and more tornadoes shot forth.\par
There was nothing Zane could do but take them. He couldn't stop the explosions.\par
Warning! Health under 25\%!\par
All his Skills so far were very offensive, nothing defensive, nothing that could help here. Maybe that was just how his mind was oriented—maybe the skills suited the person? Not all Warriors had his Titan's Fist—\par
Another blast rocked him head to toe and he stopped thinking about it. He threw himself, all of himself, into his Cyclone. Eagerly, joyfully, he set himself on fire.\par
A blast rocked him again. And again. And again—\par
He was starting to feel it, something profound. He was starting to grin. Yes, there it was—that little crack, that place where the universe took off its mask and showed its true face. He was coming to it!\par
Warning! Critical health!\par
Savage body activated\par
Strength increased 50\%\par
Speed increased 50\%\par
Vitality increased 50\%\par
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Avery leap to her feet.\par
"Stay out of it!" he shouted. And he grinned bloodily. "I have it!"\par
She must’ve read his lips—she stilled.\par
And he did have it. He could feel it. He was so close—no!\par
The tornado was trembling. The crack in the Universe was vanishing. Just a little more, just a few more explosions, and he could tear it open. He could see the Truth of it, the capital-T Truth, he could feel it, literally, burning within—\par
But the Phoenix couldn't take much more. It was burning out. His Cyclone was only growing, and now its tornado spun erratically, loosening, the head tilting end to end. Its fires flickered like a candle in a harsh wind.\par
Then, all at once, the tornado went out.\par
And the Cyclone broke through and struck the Phoenix full force. It screeched.\par
All his essence, built up revolution on revolution on revolution, poured into that one boss's body. All at once.\par
It exploded. Combustion.\par
Ash. This tale has been pilfered from Royal Road. If found on Amazon, kindly file a report.\par
It was over. Like that. \par
He blinked. Then he frowned, frustrated. The crack vanished in the air. He grasped after it, caught nothing. The Phoenix dissolved; its essence flowed into him. It wasn't enough for a Level. Just barely not enough. \par
He knew exactly how close he was, too—he could see almost all of Combustion's inner workings now, the way it acted in the universe. All you needed to do was capture it, peer through that crack—and find it in himself. Act it out himself, turn knowledge to action, make it his own, and he would have it. \par
Few things got him as excited as fighting. He’d discovered learning these Laws was a close second. A distant third, Leveling. After that… he wasn't sure. He tried cocaine once and it was alright, he supposed. It had nothing on fighting though.\par
Now all his excitement had nowhere to go.\par
Why did that Phoenix have to die so easily? He was so close to a level, so close to a Law...\par
"Zane!" cried Avery. "Look!"\par
A small glowing marble lay where the Phoenix had been, the color of molten rock. Its hues swirled slowly under its shiny surface.\par
Right. It was a Phoenix—it had that respawn skill, didn't it? \par
The core caught fire. It started burning brighter and brighter, growing bigger—\par
"You have to destroy the core!” called Avery, “Before it rises again!"\par
He thought about it. He smiled. \par
Then he started walking back to her. \par
"What are you doing? Go whack it, you big lump!"\par
"Hand me the Bag of Holding," he said. "I'll need some essence stones."\par
"What?"\par
“Can you cloak me while I heal? Should be half an hour, maybe. Then I'm good.”\par
"Zane, what the hell are you—"\par
“You play video games?”\par
“A little?” \par
“Have you heard about this thing called farming?”\par
"… Oh my God." She buried her face in her palms. \par
Time for round two.\par
*** \par
Cyclone raged against tornado and forced it back. The Phoenix could only watch as its greatest weapon was slowly shredded apart. And Zane looked into the center of it, into the heart of it. Little explosions rocked him over and over. He sought out the Truth.\par
He found it. He—\par
Warning! Health under 25\%!\par
Just a few seconds later, the Phoenix gave its final dying screech and blew out.\par
Its essence came pouring into him.\par
Level Up!  \par
Essence Level 59 -> 60\par
Hey, nice.\par
He had it now. He understood Combustion. But he was still missing a piece. He saw the shape of it in the world, but he still had to combust himself. Somehow. \par
He thought about it as the Phoenix slowly respawned.\par
He went at it again, this time he tried to put more umph into his Cyclone. He got closer, he felt, but when the Phoenix sputtered out he was still on the edge of something great. Not there. He tried again.\par
He got his Cyclone to a blinding peak this time. He shredded the Phoenix before it even got him under 50\% health. Still, though... somehow, just a little bit off.\par
Skill Up!  \par
Inferno Cyclone II -> III\par
Neat consolation prize, at least. \par
He tested his Cyclone now, did a couple of spins as he waited for the Phoenix to respawn. It only took him two spins to get where it took five last time. And at its peak, it was a lot more devastating. It threatened to bring the chamber down. This thing… each Skill-Up made it a hell of a lot stronger. \par
He killed the Phoenix again. This time it was almost trivial. And again. And he got another Level out of it, but he still hovered on the edge of the Law. He was starting to go a little mad.\par
Somehow his Cyclone didn't feel right. It was a slow thing, building into a juggernaut. Yes. He was going about this all wrong. Combustions didn't build. Combustions struck in a single instant. Boom.\par
He was using the wrong tool. Maybe... Inferno Lash? He blinked at his Axes. These were just Axe form, right? Could he still... He willed the Axe heads away. The Chains reverted. They were as they had been before the class switch, just thicker, longer, and far heavier.\par
Okay. Let’s try again. \par
This time, when the Phoenix spat her tornado at him, he blasted it with a Lash. Fire exploded on fire; they blasted each other out. Yes—he felt it! He came in closer, Lashing one after another after another. When the Phoenix was struggling to keep up, at a touch, instantly, all at once—\par
His Lash whipped through the fires. For a second, all he could see were worlds of intense reds and whites. A single glorious flash.\par
Law Comprehended! \par
Minor Law of Combustion (Elemental Laws of Fire)\par
He was so excited he almost let out a cheer. Which he'd done maybe once or twice in his life. It shocked him. He felt something burn hot against the lining of his pant pocket, reached in, and yanked out a crystal.\par
Heart of the Volcano\par
The crystal he'd gotten from the Drake's hoard, the one with the fires in the middle burning with Eruption. Avery had said just having it on him would help him grasp Fire Laws. Suddenly things made sense—he had a feeling this had sped it up a lot. Before, with Ignition and Undying Flame, he'd had those things within. They simply lay dormant.\par
It was different with Combustion. He had to start from scratch. This treasure had given him a head start.\par
In sum, he farmed the Phoenix for twelve hours and three levels before its core went dark and gave out. \par
*** \par
"You're in a good mood," said Avery.\par
Zane grunted. He supposed he was.\par
"I mean, your face looks about the same as usual," she continued, grinning, "but I can just tell."\par
They were backtracking, heading for the fork at the start of the second floor. They were off to explore the other side—the Brimstone Golem’s region.\par
After that fight he’d come across a pleasant realization. There wasn't such a thing as too easy. He didn't need to hold himself back from leveling or getting stronger. He had to be on the edge of something, but that something didn’t need to be death all the time. If he wanted to make a challenge, he could just handicap himself. Fight with base Chains instead of Axes, for instance. Even if this Brimstone Golem couldn't stand with him, he could use it like a training tool. He could make things fun.\par
On this side of the fork, there was much less lava, much more coal, and its namesake brimstone. The lava snaked through the ground in thousands of little cracks but seldom shot up over the surface.\par
The Monsters here were not interesting to Zane. These things called Shardlings, spiky fiends like jagged rocks glued together, but he swept them away with ease. Same thing with coal golems—a little bigger, like boulders glued, and little volcanoes shot out the tops of their heads, spilling lava. They looked cool but were just too weak. They weren't worth his time. Where was this boss? He was itching to try it out. \par
On the way, they found a treasure area. He didn't even bother checking it before he walked in—he just saw a bunch of red dots, swept his Chain down the room, and they all winked out.\par
"This is weird,” said Avery. “It's the most relaxed I've ever been in a D-rank dungeon."\par
She frowned at him. "Man… I wish I had a Master Ball, so I could catch you and stuff you in my pocket. Then I could just bring you around whenever I go dungeon diving. Life would be so much easier.” \par
Sometimes Avery said things that went in one ear, scrambled his brain, and fell out the other ear without leaving any meaning behind. “Uh,” he said.\par
“Zane, use Smash!”\par
“…”\par
They were getting close to the treasure area. He felt the heat of it beating on his face. The air grew dense. It felt hard to breathe…\par
\par


\section{37. Volcanic Core}
\par
\par
Cavern of Insight: Volcanic Core (D)\par
A secluded chamber with walls infused with glowing embers, ideal for comprehending the Universal Law of Fire. Only those kin to Fire may enter.\par
Requirements: 1 Minor Law of the Universal Law of Fire\par
The air sweltered with heat, sweltered with Law. Zane felt the rolling out of the chamber in thick waves. Laws did not feel like one another. That other cavern of insight was crisp and quick. These Laws lingered in the air, unwinding slowly, like the air above a blacktop on a hot summer's day.\par
After that last Law Zane found he hadn’t had his fill. He wanted more—he couldn’t get enough. He was panting a little, maybe from the heat. \par
“Well drat," Avery said. “Can't go in. What am I supposed to do?"\par
He shrugged. "Wait?"\par
She made a face. "I'll take a nap," she said. She sat down against the cave wall, drew up the cords of her hoodie, and curled into a ball. A rock shimmered into being where she used to be, and she was gone.\par
Eagerly he made for the Cavern.\par
The Cavern was a pressure cooker, fueled by the heat of the volcano. He'd only taken a step inside and already he couldn't see straight. The air in here was warped all over. When he breathed it, and he felt it scorching his lungs, drying out his throat. He looked down at his leg and saw it twisting, shimmering.\par
He took another step and grunted. It was hard not to go to his knees. The heavy air beat down on his back, and the heaviness flooded his arms, his ears, his head. It was getting into his thoughts too—making them come sluggish and lazy. He blinked, bit down, felt a sharp, clear jolt of pain, tasted salt and steel. This place was like those lava-falls, he sensed. A test.\par
He had to make it to the center. There the pressure was greatest, but the Law was greatest there too, shimmering so bright it was almost corporeal. He forced himself to take another step and another, dragging his feet across the chamber. There was a seat there, a lily pad of molten rock. He sat down, and hissed.\par
It was so painful hot he was surprised his skin wasn't melting off his body. He got out his crystal, the Heart of the Volcano, and clasped it tight in his fist. Then he closed his eyes, breathed out, and started to meditate.\par
He was never very good at sitting still and clearing his mind. He liked being in motion. He liked the feeling of physical connection. Meditation always felt like death to him, felt like the grayness. When his doctor suggested it, he'd fallen off within a week. The meds always worked so much better.\par
But this felt different. It wasn't passive at all. Every second he had to wrestle against that oppressive heat, the heat trying to crush him into nothing, trying to melt him not only physically but at the level of the soul, at the level of thought. Every second he sought out that crystal in his palm, reached out with his mind, grasping, asking it to reach back and pull him through. He was was stretched out between here and there, and all the while the heat crushed down. He let it marinate, brow furrowed, jaw set. It was a weirdly pleasurable kind of pain.\par
He could have sat there an hour, or six, or twelve—time lost meaning here. Slowly he started to drift away from his body. He wasn't a person. He was a soul in a body feeling sensations play across the skin, the back, the arms. The boundaries of the body faded away. Only feeling was left. After a while even that too felt distant, unreal.\par
The crystal in his hand felt more real. The more he reached out to it, the hotter it grew, like he was stoking its flame with his mind. He poured in more, kept up that grasping—all he'd done was sit here, yet it was still somehow exhausting. \par
Slowly he slipped away…\par
Everything felt a little hazy, like he was revisiting a poorly preserved memory. Was this that Law vision Avery had been talking about? Meditate long enough, and the Law treasure drew you in, she’d said.\par
Only… where was he? Everything was dark and blurry. The vision resolved a little. Still black, but prickled with white. He seemed to be floating in space. A great void yawned around him. The specks were stars. \par
His vision shifted away. In front of him was a massive red sun. He was so close to it it blotted out half his vision, seething with a corona of bloody light. Tongues of flame licked up and down its surface. It all felt surreal. Somehow he wasn't shocked. He felt calm. The heat of it felt like a gentle summer breeze on his wrinkled skin.\par
…Wrinkled?\par
He glanced down. His arms were wrapped in silken gray sleeves, embroidered with a strange crest: a bird carrying an elephant in its claws.\par
His body began to move, slowly, surely, flowing the way Zane had seen some of those old men doing Tai Chi at the park. The hands made signs.\par
A spark flickered into being. Just one, between the gnarled old hands.This narrative has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. If you see it on Amazon, please report it.\par
Then another.\par
It joined the first, and together they made a small flame, burning on nothing. Another, and another—\par
The air between the old man's hands was another field of stars, suddenly full of sparks, and they all rushed in, rushed to join that little flame. The field replenished as soon as it emptied. The flame got brighter, got thicker, took solid form. Zane felt calm, controlled, as he watched it.\par
No—these weren't Zane's feelings. These were the old man's.\par
What the hell was happening?\par
Sparks drew in faster and faster. The flame became a roiling ball of pure white light. It started to shake. It wanted to break loose—there was just too much energy.\par
But the old man's will clamped down. He forced it to stay. He forced it to cave in on itself, thickening, brightening, heating up, and only now did Zane realize that each little spark was hotter than any flame he'd ever seen. Each little spark was laden with Laws so dense, so vast, he couldn’t even perceive them at first. Not until the old man’s attention shifted briefly over them, and he saw the breathtaking infinity hidden in that little spark.\par
The oddest thought came to Zane. He'd fostered a cat once, a tabby. He used to watch Breaking Bad reruns with it. It stared so intently at the television screen, though it obviously didn't know what was going on. One of the greatest pieces of human cinema flashed in its face, and all the cat saw was meaningless noise. He felt in that moment like that cat. He was reeling.\par
The moment passed. He tried to catch up. A thousand sparks spawned a second, and died the next, swallowed by the burgeoning flame. You couldn't even call it a flame anymore, or a fireball—they didn't do it justice.\par
This old man held a star between his hands.\par
And that star hated him.\par
It hated being so small. It wanted to blow out, to swallow the world, but the old man didn't let it. His will forced it in place.\par
What did it mean to erupt?\par
It meant to turn up the heat, more and more. And when the fire couldn't take it anymore, to turn it up still, to throw spark after spark in, and to hold it there, in a state intolerable to nature. It meant to create an intense tension, an intense pressure, and with that came a want, a desperate, passionate yearning to be free.\par
Eruption, then, was simple; he felt it. At its essence it was to clamp down. And then, only when the pressure grew unbearable—\par
Let go. All at once. \par
But not carelessly—no. An eruption was an explosion bent to the will, destruction given direction. It went where you wanted it to go.\par
The old man extended a hand, gestured at the red giant floating before them.\par
One white line cut across space at the speed of light. The sheer power there… Zane couldn't begin to imagine it. It boggled the mind. He was starting to feel a little freaked out, which was saying something.\par
Then the star exploded.\par
The scene whited out. He was sweating so badly his hair was matted to his head. He couldn't think.\par
What the fuck?\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Eruption (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
What the fuck?\par
He sat there in a daze for a long while.\par
Had that been real? Had that old man just…\par
What?!\par
What Level was he? A thousand? More? And those Laws… \par
He shook his head. He couldn't hold on to it anymore, just the impression of it. It felt like he'd woken from a dream. All the specifics were fading from him. The only clear impression he was left with was awe. Utter awe.\par
And then, when that ebbed…\par
A burning want.\par
You could get that strong?!\par
He felt like a man standing at the base of some huge mountain whose peak went beyond the cloud layer. He couldn't see it, but…\par
Fuck. Fuck! \par
He wanted to learn that power. \par
No. He wanted more than that—he wanted to be just as strong as that man. But it wasn’t just that either. \par
In that instant he desperately wanted to fight that man. Just to see what it felt like. He was grinning wildly just thinking about it. He was trying to imagine what a fight would look like at that level… He couldn't.\par
He just knew, deep in his heart, it would be beautiful. \par
It was all a dream for now. It felt like one. So distant, so unattainable, those little point thinking on it much. He slowly drifted back down to earth.\par
He just got a new Law. They all seemed to fit together suddenly—there was a natural flow to them: Ignition, Combustion, Eruption, Undying Flame… what did they all add up to?\par
Some Major Law. He had all he needed. But finding a way to condense them… what could they make? Avery's major Law was ‘Harmonic Balance’—a synthesis of her minor Laws. Maybe his was Major Law of the… Flame Lifecycle?\par
He frowned. This wasn't a guessing game. The name was just a label. Whatever it was, it would come as a phenomenon, a feeling. He needed to experience it. And to do that, he somehow needed to hold all four Minor Laws in his mind at once…\par
God.\par
He kept drifting back to the old man with the sun in his hands. It was suddenly incredibly hard to concentrate on the Major Law. \par
He spent another two hours sitting there trying to focus. It wasn't happening. He managed to get his mind off the old man, but he was shot. Some other day, he decided. He stood.\par
Avery wasn't there, so he waited by the entrance. About an hour later she came back, looking cranky. The top of her hoodie was singed black, lightly smoking.\par
"What happened?" he said.\par
"I got bored," she said. "And… okay, maybe I was a little jealous of all those Levels you got at those lava falls. So I found this patch of lava, and… look, I don't want to talk about it. Why do you look so stoned?"\par
“…”\par
They went off to fight the final boss. The Brimstone Golem.\par
\par


\section{38. The Battle of Mount Saint Helens (I) }
\par
Where the Molten Phoenix's lair was a vast expanse, the Brimstone Golem's was a cramped bedrock cell. Its walls were craggy and bleak. The ground was shattered, run over with cracks. Wisps of smoke curled out, lit red by a magma glow.\par
It looked like a prison for a demon.\par
The boss itself lay dormant at its center, a pile of rocks scribed over with glowing purple runes like some unholy shrine. Smoke drifted out from its joints. Zane checked it out as they got close.\par
Brimstone Golem (Monster)\par
Essence Level 63\par
Fist of Stone (Active) [Rare]\par
Channels the essence of the earth through massive stone-like fists. When it strikes, the impact radiates seismic waves capable of shattering the ground and causing significant area damage. Power scales with Level.\par
Brimstone Body (Passive) [Uncommon]\par
Fortifies the body with a layer of molten brimstone, granting great resistance to physical and elemental damage. Also grants immunity to fire-based attacks and enhances regeneration capabilities, especially in environments rich in fire or earth.\par
The Golem’s weaknesses were the joints.\par
He felt a stab of disappointment. That’s it?\par
“What's the plan?" said Avery.\par
"I'm going to punch it," he said.\par
"You'll what now?”\par
He was already striding into the lair. "Don't interfere."\par
It rose to meet him, red eyes flickering on, and bellowed.\par
He supposed it was time to test his theory—that he could make any fight fun if he handicapped himself enough. Fuck it.\par
He put up his fists. Let’s go.\par
The Golem raised fists of its own, three times the size of Zane's, probably a hell of a lot heavier too. They burst into blinding streams of crackling flame.\par
Then it charged him.\par
He charged it back. In fights his mind always ran on tactics—how to sneak this shot through, how to get that skill to land where he wanted, how to trick the enemy. He shut that part of his brain up, grinned, and just threw.\par
His fist crunched against its face. His hand erupted in pain, but he was pretty sure it hadn't broken. He was pleased to see he’d blasted off a chunk where its nose had been.\par
Then it ripped him in the belly, and all the air went out of him. Its other hook slapped off the head, turned him nearly all the way around. He stumbled away. It marched after him, and he licked his bloodied lips. Okay. I see you.\par
This time, it came straight for his head, swung like a batter, and he ducked, smashing an elbow into its chin. It staggered back, and he ripped it once, twice to its midsection, blasting square holes in the black stone. It let out a metallic screech. It reached out to grab him, and he cracked it in the face. It stumbled over itself; he pivoted, ripped it up the middle, pivoted again, and served it an uppercut that nearly took its head off.\par
At almost the same time, something struck the side of his head. He went down. He heard Avery yell something. The world spun before his bleary eyes; he felt very wobbly, unsteady, and he stumbled back, trying to get his bearings as the boss lumbered toward him. Somehow it must’ve whacked him when he wasn’t looking.\par
Warning! Health under 75\%\par
He hadn't even seen what hit him—it had to be that Skill. He loved it. This thing was putting up a fight! He lunged for it again, cracked it once, twice, thrice, felt its fist crunch into his ribs, spun with it, and his elbow took off the last of its mouth. It blasted him up the nose and broke it instantly—he heard it crack in three places. He slugged it back and shot off a chunk of its arm. He couldn't tell what its health was, but he figured they were pretty even.\par
They sloughed on in this brutal back and forth. It struck and broke him, and he struck and broke it back. Back and forth and back until—\par
Warning! Health under 50\%\par
This might go down to the wire.\par
To his annoyance, though, the golem seemed more durable than he was. When it broke his arm, he couldn't punch anymore. When he broke its arm, it kept clobbering like usual. It seemed unfair. The fight started to turn.\par
He slugged it. Then he was on the ground again, spitting out blood, spitting out teeth, a huge white noise roar in his ears. He groaned. It must’ve snuck that Skill through again.\par
Warning! Health under 25\%\par
He scrambled up, and it clocked him in the eye so hard he nearly went down again.\par
“I swear to fucking God, Zane—” Avery was saying.The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.\par
He grinned. She was right. Enough playing around. He'd had his fun. They were getting to the point where there was a chance he might lose this thing, which would be an incredibly stupid way to go. He figured this was a good line to draw.\par
When it came at him again, he had an idea. He wound his fist all the way back.\par
It swung for him. He dodged, turned, and brushed off an old trick he hadn't used in ages.\par
A blinding crescent swept through the air.\par
Titan's Fist!\par
He caught it near the chin—or where its chin had been before he'd blasted it off. The point where its head met its neck. All the force of his essence, all the force of his body, poured into that point.\par
The golem's head blasted off, hit the ceiling, cracked back against the ground, and bounced once, twice, thrice, four times, before rolling at last to a halt.\par
The body fell limp to its knees.\par
The Brimstone Golem has been slain!\par
Dungeon: Mount Saint Helens (D) has been cleared\par
Avery looked nonplussed as he walked back.\par
"I don't believe it," she said. "You went fistfighting with a literal chunk of rock. And won."\par
“Mm.”\par
“That’s the most you thing I’ve ever heard.”\par
***\par
He took some time to heal before they left. A couple of hours, soaking in essence, and he was pretty much patched up. They started making their way up the long, winding trek to daylight.\par
After a long climb, they broke out into the open again. The sunlight was a revelation. Avery hummed cheerfully.\par
"So tell me about this settlement of yours,” she said. "I want to know what my new home’s like."\par
He wasn't sure where to start. "It's called the Luminous Faction. It's led by Reina—she's a very competent lady. She runs the place. I’m just…there." He paused. She was the one who made the hierarchy and took care of the day-to-day. He was a little fuzzy on how to describe it all, to be honest. "There's lots of people there. Maybe a thousand by now? We've got a solid army, lots of Level 20s, a few 30s. There's lots of… forest."\par
He realized he was doing a horrible job actually describing the place. "… You'll see when you get there."\par
"I meant like—are there beds? You know, running water and stuff?"\par
"… yes. We're not animals."\par
"Oh good! I was worried. No offense. I thought you were the leader at first, so I kind of imagined it was a bunch of cavemen hitting each other with sticks." She grinned at him.\par
He decided to ignore that. "You can join the scouting corps if you like. Or the warriors."\par
"Woah, woah! Hold on there. I'm not doing any of that. I just want a place to stay—I'll do my own thing, help out here and there, y’know?"\par
They were passing through a grove of ash trees, walking through a barren valley.\par
"I'm bad with authority," she said, wrinkling her nose. "I—wait."\par
She stilled. "Something feels weird."\par
"What—"\par
"Shhh!"\par
He stood there, looking at her, watching her face change. At first, she seemed baffled. Then her eyes widened, and her mouth dropped open a little. And the color started draining out of her face.\par
"Oh," she whispered. "Oh no."\par
"What?"\par
"Oh, that's... That's a lot. How hadn't I heard them?! Oh—they were waiting, they had to be. They knew."\par
One moment there was nothing.\par
Then his mini-map was ringed with white dots.\par
Dots pouring in fast—there must have been hundreds.\par
He turned and saw them cresting the hills behind him. He turned again, and there they were, all round. "It's Marcus, has to be," she said. Her voice was getting shaky. "That's a division's worth!"\par
Instantly, Zane drew his axes. "Stay close," he said. Just as they started pouring down the hill, he threw up a Cyclone—first revolution—\par
He hissed, stumbling back. It was like he'd been struck by a lightning bolt, straight in his heart. For a second he couldn't think. The Skill was broken—the axes flopped away.\par
He looked up and saw the person who shot him. A lanky, sharp-eyed, hawk-nosed man clad in an iron gray uniform. He held a huge blue bow strung up with a flickering white string. It buzzed with electricity.\par
Jared Bennett (Creature)\par
Essence Level 67\par
Class: Sniper Sentinel\par
The archer smirked at him. Already the man was drawing a second arrow.\par
Zane almost said ‘get behind me’ but the enemy was there too. They had them surrounded. Just like that. They were mostly in the Level 40s. Small, but with this many of them…\par
And at their fore, five men sauntered up, all clad in brutal gray. The archer was one of them. Another was a thickly bearded, middle-aged man as big as Zane was. A greatsword as big as he was lay slung over his shoulder.\par
Conor Harrison (Creature)\par
Essence Level 61\par
Class: War Blade\par
There was a squat, bald, broad-shouldered one, shield in one hand, cudgel in another.\par
Jack Briggs (Creature)\par
Essence Level 55\par
Class: Earthen Guardian\par
A red-headed man with black gloves and cruel, mirthful eyes.\par
Tony Foster (Creature)\par
Essence Level 64\par
Class: Divine Emissary\par
Then the man at the front, the smallest of them with the biggest pin. He reminded Zane of a sewer rat.\par
Gregory Clay (Creature)\par
Essence Level 71\par
Class: Nightwalker\par
Clay cackled. “Savage Sage! Zane Walker! Fancy meeting you here. We were just looking for you. You've been a very bad boy.”\par
He licked his lips. “You've made my boss very, very angry. What was that you said? ‘I hope they bring someone stronger next time?’”\par
How had they heard that?\par
“Well?!” Clay swept his arms across the hundreds of soldiers pinning them in. “What do you think? Strong enough for you?”\par
He laughed a wheezing laugh. Nobody else did.\par
Zane tried to reckon the odds. He was strong now, true, but how strong? A Level 55, a 61, a 64, a 67, and the 71… like three Brimstone Golems, and a creature far stronger than that Phoenix boss… all coordinated as a team.\par
And they were surrounded by grunts. There was nowhere to go.\par
Not good.\par
It seemed Avery had come to the same conclusion. She was staring at him, wide-eyed. "We have to get out of here," she said. "We—hrrng!" She fell to the ground, spasming.\par
That archer had shot her so fast neither of them could react. That arrow… it was laden with Minor Laws, Laws of Lightning.\par
Avery was still shaking, seemingly on the verge of blacking out.\par
“I was speaking,” said Clay, lips pursed. “Didn't your parents teach you manners?”\par
“I,” breathed Zane. He was trembling. “Am going to kill you.” He didn’t say it to Clay. He said it to the archer.\par
“What a coincidence!” said Clay, grinning deep-yellow teeth. “I'd very much like to do the same to you. You should know, by the way—” He ripped open buttons near his chest and showed a glowing yellow crystal there. “The boss is watching. So let's put on a good show for him, eh? You've really pissed him off! He doesn't just want you dead. He wants to see you squeal.”\par
Strangely hearing that calmed Zane down. He was still furious, but not because of what Clay said—he couldn’t care less less how much they needled him. He was furious they dared touch Avery. He’d been on the verge of lunging after them. Then Clay opened his mouth, and Zane realized that was exactly what they wanted.\par
His blood was hot with rage; his mind was cold with rage. He had to think. That archer was drawing another arrow. He had to clear out all these grunts, had to whittle down the pack, but he had no time to set up his greatest weapon. And worse, it was Avery lying here, almost catatonic. If he went after them… what would happen to her?\par
…Had they caught him?\par
\par


\section{39. The Battle of Mount Saint Helens (II)}
\par
There was only one thing to try. The last thing Avery told him—"Get out of here." But where? He was stuck in a valley, and everywhere he looked there were soldiers.\par
He was trapped.\par
"Smile, you're on camera!” said Clay. He bared a nasty, gap-toothed grin. “Anything last words?”\par
The strong ones—the Lieutenants, the General—were mostly to the front and to his left. Behind him the lines were thinner. And a good thing too.\par
Behind him was the only place he could hide. The second floor.\par
There, maybe there were corridors where he could hold them. Choke points. At least he could hide Avery somewhere safe. If they swamped him here, he was done.\par
Even if he ignored the rest of the grunts, just fighting those Lieutenants and the General all at once… Even just fighting them one by one was dicey. But if they worked like any semblance of a team…\par
He was fucked.\par
There was no other way. The only question was, could he make it back to the cave before they crushed him? He wished he had a defensive skill. No time for regrets. He had a shitty second-best option. It would have to do.\par
All these thoughts flashed through his mind in a second.\par
Clay let out a drawn-out sigh. “How disappointing. Well then, let's get on with it!"\par
The archer drew his bow. The swordsman unslung his greatsword, and the barbarian hefted his cudgel. Clay pointed a quivering finger at Zane, and his lips curved up in a cruel grin.\par
"Kill him!"\par
At the same moment, Zane summoned his Chains. He switched them back, Chain form instantly—easier to wrap—turned and lunged for Avery's fallen body. He felt a hail of essence coming at him. He didn't bother dodging. The only thing that mattered to him right now was making sure she was safe. He picked her up and shielded her.\par
At the same time, he threw up his Chains. It didn't matter where—just over him, to take what shots they could.\par
Still, the wave that got through drove him to his knees. He wheezed. It felt like he had been struck by a massive scalding hammer.\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
He stood and started wrapping his Chains around him. They coiled over him like twin snakes, covering as much as they could—he wanted as little skin exposed as possible. He felt them shaking as more Skills crashed against them. His Chains wrapped his neck, his head. A barrage of shots still sneaked through, stinging all over, but it would have to do.\par
He turned and ran for it.\par
Avery whispered something. He couldn't hear her over the din. "You're safe," he told her. "I've got you."\par
He ran for all he was worth.\par
He lunged up the side of the valley and bowled straight through the thick of the enemy lines. They tried to hold, tried to stop him, but wrapped as he was in Chains, he was monstrously heavy. His momentum was incredible, undeniable. The ones who tried to get in the way were sent flying at a touch. Some he trampled underfoot.\par
He put in a dozen solid strides. He could see the cave mouth looming in the distance—\par
He hissed, felt something rip through the back of his knee, felt the ligaments there tear. An electricity spasm of his body, almost made him fall over.\par
Warning: Health under 50\%!\par
"Fuck," he hissed. It was that archer.\par
He kept running, limping a little on the leg now. He tried shifting his Chains to cover it, but he'd hardly gotten 10 more strides before another shot ripped him through the knee.\par
Fuck! The others were splashing shots at him, but that man found the holes where they couldn’t.\par
Zane felt his leg slowly start to give out. He was limping heavily now. Any shot that snuck through, battering his back, tearing at his arms, his legs, was a little extra weight dragging him to the ground.\par
The second floor cavern was so close—just a few dozen strides away…\par
Warning: Health under 25\%!\par
He couldn't fail here. He wouldn’t consider it. It pissed him off in a lot of ways. First—Avery would die, and that was not acceptable. And second—it was pathetic. Running with his tail between his legs? He refused to go out like this.\par
But first, he had to make it to the cave. And he did, stumbling, breathing heavy. By the time he got to the stairs, he was falling more than running—he fell through the cave mouth and just started tumbling down the stairs, faster and faster like a boulder picking up speed. He bounced; he ricocheted; there was no controlling it.Unauthorized use of content: if you find this story on Amazon, report the violation.\par
Eventually, he landed in a sordid halt, splattering against the cavern wall. When he yanked himself out, there was a new crater where he'd been.\par
Avery staggered out from him.\par
“You alright?” he breathed.\par
She nodded. They heard shouts pouring in from high above. The enemy would be here soon. Very soon.\par
"We can't go on like this," said Avery, shivering.\par
"We will.”\par
"No, I mean—we can't just keep running. They'll trap us! We need to fight back. We need to get your Cyclone going, it’s the only way we stand a chance!"\par
He couldn't agree more. But even at max power, he wasn't sure his Cyclone could handle an army that big, that strong. If only he’d gotten that Major Law… but there was no time for regret now.\par
They saw faces pop up through the murk, red and eager and twisted, frighteningly close. An electric arrow whizzed by. He chucked up a Chain and deflected it by pure chance. They picked a random tunnel and dashed through.\par
"There's no time," he said. "I need time to set up my Cyclone, but they'll be here in seconds."\par
"I'll give you time!” she insisted. “I’ll hold them."\par
"How?"\par
"Here—this tunnel! It’ll be a bottleneck. See that cavern?” She pointed to the tunnels’ end, a jagged bright opening rushing at them fast. “There's space there for you to set up. I'll hold them here."\par
She had the same idea he had earlier. Only… could she hold them? She was Level 55—her, against the whole army? And she’d just gotten shot down, too… she was stilly wobbly on her feet. She must’ve seen the doubt in his face.\par
"Trust me!” she said, so fiercely he was taken aback. “We have to do this, or we're both dead.”\par
He hesitated. Then nodded, despite it all. She was right. There was no other way. “I trust you.”\par
"How long do you need?"\par
“Fifteen seconds." Fifteen was cutting it close, but he couldn't ask for more.\par
The cavern loomed up ahead, and Avery nodded to him. "Go!"\par
She was frail, unsteady, trembling. She was pale; she looked even smaller than she usually did. But there was a fierce resolve in her bright green eyes.\par
He ran through the tunnel and instantly started his Cyclone. His axes spun. A gale whipped to life.\par
She stayed behind at the tunnel's mouth. She breathed out. The air shimmered before her. On the other end, the army burst through.\par
"Bring it!" she cried.\par
***\par
His heart felt like it was about to beat out of his chest. 1… 2… It all slowed to a crawl. Zane could only watch, urging his axes on, as a torrent of essence poured through the tunnel and struck her. There was so much light it was a struggle not to look away. Avery screamed.\par
But she held it there. She covered it with her palms, and somehow, with a huge effort, managed to turn it, swerve it back on the enemy. All that light went bouncing back as though off a mirror. He heard screams echo down the tunnel.\par
She stood there, panting. Her small hands were charred black.\par
3… 4...\par
A flash of lightning shot down the tunnel.\par
But this time she was ready for it. It bounced off her, went careening into the wall. "Nice try,” she spat.\par
The shots poured in faster, brighter. She caught a stream of essence-light on the tip of her finger, balanced it there, turned, spun, and sent it shunting back through. Fire raged at her, and she met it head-on, scattering it into the tunnel walls. She sent a blast of air scattering down the other way. A raging whitewater river flooded her, and she reversed its flow.\par
She was wobbling so hard he was worried she'd black out any moment, but somehow she held her ground. Where was she getting the strength?\par
5… 6… 7…\par
His Cyclone was picking up steam, starting to rage.\par
The Legion was catching on. The ranks broke open, and the Lieutenants came crashing through. The swordsman and the barbarian dashed for her, side by side, the archer close behind.\par
Shit.\par
They were all in the 60s. He nearly went to help. Then she caught his eye.\par
“You stay there, Zane Walker, I swear to God—!” she screamed.\par
9… 10…\par
Then they were upon her.\par
The greatsword flashed icy blue. An avatar of light sprung out of it, blowing up to twice its size. Roaring, the swordsman slashed.\par
Avery caught the blade.\par
She cried out when she did. Her hands bled. But she’d still caught it. She turned it, shunted it away, sent the swordsman stumbling after it.\par
Then the cudgel almost brained her, but she caught that too, somehow, flowed with it, spun it around, and all that force jerked back up the cudgel. The barbarian was blasted back—like he was the one who’d gotten hit.\par
An electric arrow whistled for her throat. Avery batted it out of the air.\par
How was she doing that?\par
She was bleeding, clearly beyond exhausted, but her jaw was clenched tight.\par
11… 12… 13…\par
They came at her again. She slipped the sword in a dance-step, laid a hand on the swordsman, and all his momentum went backwards. He went flying, bellowing. The cudgel came at her from the other side, steaming with metal Laws, and she caught it—on the tip of her fingers.\par
Zane was as shocked as the barbarian was. All around Avery, the ground burst with cracks—it was like she'd made herself a perfect conduit for force. That blow was grounded.\par
“Fuck off!” she growled. And she sent him hurtling away.\par
It hit him then how she was doing this. The answer was simple.\par
She was doing this—throwing herself beyond her limits—because she promised him she would.\par
He needed her. So she answered the call.\par
She kept herself upright, kept herself moving, by sheer force of will. Because she had to. Because he was counting on her.\par
Some folk shrank when all the odds were stacked against them. But a rare few, a special few, rose to meet the challenge.\par
Zane realized with a shock she was a kindred spirit.\par
She was jokey and fun-loving and said silly, dumb things. That was all a façade. Avery Lively was a Signed, and that was no accident. Under the surface… this happy-go-lucky girl was a monster in her own right.\par
They kept hitting her. And she just would not go down.\par
She saw everything coming. And so long as she did, it was like nothing could touch her. Her eyes were wide, glowed eerie bright.\par
Just a little more…! Zane’s Cyclone had gone so loud the room was starting to shake. But all eyes were on Avery. She was stumbling drunkenly all over herself; her hands were mangled. Every time the cudgel struck her, every time the blade cleaved at her, he thought they’d squish her to nothing. She was so small in the face of them, but they couldn’t put her down. Zane realized then he was watching something extraordinary, a shocking feat of will—a single underLeveled girl staring down an army, and somehow, impossibly, winning—\par
Avery froze.\par
She blinked, looked down.\par
There was a knife sticking out of her chest. A huge black knife, smoking with shadows. Zane’s heart stopped.\par
“Oh,” she whispered. Her eyes rolled back. And she crumpled.\par
The knife owner stepped out of the shadows at her feet. A grinning, rat-faced man.\par
“Oops!” said Clay. He licked his lips. “How sad. She was doing so well, too, the poor thing. Ah, well—”\par
He saw the look on Zane's face, and he froze. “Err—“\par
Zane howled.\par
His Cyclone lit up brighter than it ever had, brighter than he would’ve thought possible. Just as the Legion hordes poured through the open tunnel.\par
He felt something crack. In him, and out. A crack in the face of the world.\par
And the air began to bend.\par


\section{40. The Battle of Mount Saint Helens (III) }
\par
He'd never known such rage.\par
Ignition.\par
Combustion.\par
Eruption.\par
Undying Flame.\par
Zane howled, and he felt them all at once. Something within him caught fire. And he saw the truth of the world—the feeling that was the core of all fires. A crack ran through his mind, and as he peered through it, he saw the essence of a flame. He knew its hateful heart. He knew its powers of destruction.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Major Law of Scorched Wrath (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
The Legion poured into the cavern, still gleeful, still oblivious, still utterly unaware of what they were running into.\par
Zane's Cyclone changed colors.\par
That behemoth of flame, burning so white it looked like staring at the sun, went blacker than night. And a new fire broke into the world, a fire risen as though from the depths of hell. Zane's fury made real in monstrous form.\par
The barbarian Lieutenant waded in just as it changed, his massive steel cudgel swinging. Metal laws crusted his skin. He wore a greedy, ugly smile.\par
Then the flames struck him, and he screamed.\par
Each black fleck burned a cattle brand on his skin. He stared at his arms and legs in disbelief—why wasn't his Laws protecting him? Then the fire got in his face, and Zane heard its furious roar as it took hold. The barbarian screamed, bent over, clutching at his eyes, trying to get it out. All he did was wipe away melting skin.\par
Zane's Axe flashed at his face. Somehow the man managed to throw up a cudgel, a feeble try at blocking. The two weapons met. There was an explosion of fire—not any explosion. This explosion flashed darkness, not light.\par
And Zane's Axe cleaved the cudgel in two. Both halves blasted off in opposite directions; he saw the steel crumble to ash mid-air. That weapon was dust before it hit the ground. The Axe didn't even slow.\par
It went through the barbarian's neck like there was nothing there.\par
The head went flying. Shock flickered across the man's face. The next moment it was gone, smoking away, the flesh, the skin, the bone, all crumbling black. The water in the eyes evaporated. The hair was made smoke. Ashes scattered into the storm.\par
The rest of the man's body slumped after, crumbling too. The fire was a hate that knew no end. It devoured until you were nothing. And even then, it danced on the ashes.\par
A line of grunts came running behind him, saw what happened to their leader, tried desperately slowing, turning away—too late. The winds tore them off their feet, sent them flying, screaming into the bloody grinder. Once the flares on those Cyclone winds caught hold of them, they were helpless. One turn in that hellish merry-go-round and the Axes barely had to work. They were nothing, and nothing, and nothing. Bodies dissolved to ash, and ash made swirling essence—it all came pouring into Zane, a river of brilliant light.\par
He roared.\par
Only then did the rest of them realize they'd made a terrible mistake.\par
The back line of grunts was scrambling away, scrambling to the tunnel mouth, shoving over each other to get through, shouting in mindless panic. There were so many crammed so tight they clogged it up. The Lieutenants tried to back out too, but they were too close. It was too late. The Cyclone dragged them in kicking and screaming. The Archer stuck his bow into the ground, stumbling, trying to hold, but the winds yanked him out and tore him away. The swordsman held firm, feet planted for all of a second. Then he went over, tumbling head-over-heels. The Level 71 General had thrown up a shield of warped shadows but even that trembled, flickering, barely holding. None of them could get out.\par
They were trapped in here with him.\par
He was so furious when he saw a small body hurtling toward him he almost burned it too. Then he realized it was Avery, limp, unconscious. He shunted her far behind, out of reach.\par
And he went to work on the rest of them.\par
The Archer first, tumbling toward him, flailing, catching nothing. The Axes were too merciful for this one. Instead, Zane sucked him into the inner layers of the Cyclone, where the fire burned thickest. He watched as the man thrashed and screamed, watched the fear in his face turn to horror, then droop as skin and muscle melted off of the bone.\par
All the while, Zane held him there, looked him dead in the eyes as he thrashed, saw the animal fear in them; he saw them watering in pain, in horror, drank it all in until the eyes dulled and saw nothing, and burned away until the body crumbled to dust.\par
And Zane fulfilled his promise to the man.\par
The swordsman was heavier and braver. He managed to find his footing. Even as the fires tore through his limbs, he roared a battle cry and ran at Zane. Usually Zane would throw the Axe at the neck or the joints, an easy weakness. But the sheer brute raw strength of his Axes meant that man's whole body was a weakness. The Axe found him at a shoulder, carved a brutal line down to the hip, and exited there. He looked surprised as his bottom half dropped out from under him. He opened his mouth, tried roaring something. Then the flames got in his throat and he choked. The rest of him went up in smoke.\par
Then there was the Divine Emissary, the Last Lieutenant struggling at the edge of the Cyclone, still trying to make for the tunnel. Trying to get away. He caught Zane's eyes, and he panicked. He was babbling, screaming something, pleading for mercy, maybe. Zane sent an Axe after him. It left no corpse as it came back.Stolen novel; please report.\par
And like that, he stood in a cavern of ashes. The soldiers were made nothing, the Lieutenants made nothing.\par
Zane was still seething with rage, heaving with it.\par
But though his feelings still burned bright, his body was starting to fail on him. He was running out of essence. But the job wasn't done.\par
There was still one to go.\par
He turned to the last man standing, the General.\par
The man cut a sorry figure. Half his body smoldered with burns. His skin was waxy, slightly melted. Black holes pitted his body. He hid under a shadowy shield, which was serving him about as well as an umbrella in a hurricane. He licked his cracked, dry lips nervously. He mouthed something Zane couldn't hear. He screamed it again. Nothing. The man wore a trembling, oily smile—like a boy with his hand in the cookie jar, feigning remorse. Like he thought he could still talk his way out of this.\par
Zane brought both Axes down on his head.\par
But the moment before it hit, the General vanished. His body dissolved in shadow.\par
And it reappeared right in Zane's face. Gone was that remorseful smile. Instead he wore a smug, triumphant grin.\par
Then a dark knife slid into Zane's chest, and he felt an awful energy tear through him. He choked.\par
But Zane grabbed the wrist as it went in.\par
Warning: Critical health!\par
Savage body activated!\par
Strength increased 50\%\par
Vitality increased 50\%\par
Speed increased 50\%\par
The last of his essence rushed through his hands, into that wrist, up the General's body. And his face went from smug to horrified in an instant.\par
The little rat-faced man thrashed and kicked and yelled. He tried yanking out the knife, but Zane held him firm. Another knife materialized in the man's free hand. He thrust at Zane's throat lightning-quick, and Zane barely caught it. Then the General was well and truly stuck.\par
All Zane's hate poured into him.\par
The fire burned the General inside out. At first, it was like nothing was happening—like the General was squealing for no reason, spasming for no reason, twitching, eyelids fluttering, for no reason. Zane wished in that moment he had telepathy so he could peer in and see just how much the man was suffering, and savor it truly.\par
At last the man stilled. His skin crumbled away, showing the hollowed-out husk beneath. Like wildfire eating through a dead tree, leaving only the trunk behind. The General crumbled to dust. To nothing.\par
And Zane sank to his knees. He blinked down at his chest. Where the blade struck, a black rot ran deep—straight into his heart. Darkness fringed his vision; an immense weakness took hold of his limbs. His eyes started rolling back. He was dead.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 63 -> 64\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 64 -> 65\par
The Cyclone faded away. There was a strange silence—it sounded like a graveyard, not a battlefield.\par
Zane opened his mouth and let out a choked scream. A scream of agony and triumph all at once. He wasn't joyful like he usually was after fights. But burning those men alive…\par
That satisfied him in a way he'd never felt before.\par
He'd gotten his vengeance.\par
He knelt there, head tilted to the sky, as though to heaven. He knelt there and basked.\par
Then he froze. He remembered. Avery!\par
He turned and searched her out—her body was still unmoving, splayed against a rock column. He dashed to her and shook her. Her face was pale, her lips blue. Her arm felt far too cold.\par
Why hadn’t she leveled from all essence? Shouldn’t she have gotten some too?\par
She had to be living. She was still here. There was still a chance. There, by her side--the bag of holding. He rifled through it but found nothing to heal her.\par
The corruption had swallowed up her chest. She was breathing so shallowly it was like she wasn't breathing at all. That blackness was up to the base of her neck now. It was spreading visibly. It would soon be at her throat, her head… He had to get her to a Healer! But where? There just wasn't time—\par
Wait. Safe Zones granted a regeneration buff to their Faction members!\par
He sprinted through the tunnel, up the steps, lunging for the center of the mini-map. So help him God if he met any straggler legion soldiers on the way—but he didn't. Once they saw their leaders go down, it seemed they all fled.\par
The Beacon lay near an essence spring. He claimed it for the Luminous Faction, then sprinted back down. By the time he got there, he found the spread had slowed to a crawl.\par
But it was still crawling on.\par
Fuck.\par
The Beacon wasn't strong enough. He needed a real Healer.\par
He grabbed Avery and ran for it.\par
***\par
He ran for half a day straight, never stopping. He dashed past safe zone after safe zone, all empty. After what felt like dozens of tries, he finally came upon a settled zone—' Starlit Glade', a sparsely wooded zone scattered with ancient, thin, tall trees curled up with faintly glowing vines. Their town square was a crescent of wood huts. He burst up the middle of it, and the dozen or so people there all froze, staring at him. Mostly twenties, a few older folk, all dressed in plain cloth, all baffled-looking.\par
"…Sir Zane?" someone gasped.\par
"I need a Healer!" He roared. All at once they scrambled to obey.\par
The town Healer was a squat, middle-aged lady named Evelyn Hart, who seemed quite frazzled to be in his presence; she kept shaking and stumbling over her words. The lady was only in the low Level 20s—she hadn't even gotten her second class yet. All she could do for Avery was send in a constant stream of healing. She kept apologizing as she did.\par
They needed someone stronger to get rid of the corruption for good. And the best Healer they had was still Reina. "I could send a message back to base camp, sir," said Evelyn. "But Miss Reina—I'm not meant to call her, sir, she's very busy. It might be a while—"\par
"Do it," said Zane. "Tell her Zane needs her, now. She'll come."\par
An hour later, Reina arrived, flushed and gasping, like she'd sprinted all the way here in one go. Zane had been pouring resources into her lately. She was up to Level 38.\par
"I came as soon as I got the message," she said. "Where is she?"\par
Zane took her to the Healer's cabin, where Evelyn was still struggling to keep Avery breathing. The rot was nearly all the way up her neck now. Then Reina got to work.\par
She threw up a Blessing that instantly boosted Avery out of critical territory. The main Faction beacon was still E-grade; it hadn't unlocked the higher-level shops, the ones that had healing treasures. But Reina still had salves and bandages she could pair with her buffs. And she'd called help. Soon after she came and stabilized Avery for good, Healers came pouring in from all the nearby neighborhoods.\par
They just had to get Avery conscious again. Then she could draw in essence from stones on her own and heal herself.\par
Zane never left Avery's bedside as they worked. When Reina asked who she was, all he said was, "A friend." She could tell he wasn't in the mood to say more.\par
Now it seemed Avery would be alright, he had some space to think about the last few hours.\par
That was the most fear he'd felt in a long, long time. Maybe ever. And he'd been held there that whole run back… he hated that feeling. It was like he'd discovered some crucial chink in his armor he never knew he had.\par
Friends. He'd always been aloof with people. He'd had 'friends you gamed with,' 'friends you spoke to in class, once in a while,' 'friends' he might've known for years. Compared to this, they weren't friends at all. He felt for the first time he had true friends, friends you could die for.\par
And they exposed him to negative feelings at an intensity that he did not enjoy, fear and rage like he'd never known. He'd only ever felt rage at a 3, maybe a 4 at most. Then suddenly he'd leaped to a 9, a 10. It shocked him. Hurt him, and he shrugged it off pretty easily. Hurt his friends, and he seemed to react like how most people treat attacks on themselves. It was… troublesome. Worrying.\par
It had only been this way with family before. And Sophie, once. He hadn’t felt this way in years.\par
He didn't regret being friends with Avery. Yet he realized from now on that he should be very careful who he chose as a friend. He decided he'd keep a small circle. He was friendly with folk like Cale, but he was not a true friend. Before today, Zane had only counted Reina.\par
Now there was Avery.\par


\section{41. Little Things}
\par
Zane was sitting against the cabin wall, thinking about his new Major Law, when Avery woke.\par
He heard her groan, and he was on his feet in an instant. She rubbed her eyes, blinking, squinting against the light.\par
"What happened?" she croaked. "I feel like shit."\par
"You're awake." Relief flooded him.\par
"Yeah, what about it? Oh! That asshat got me, didn't he?"\par
She patted her chest. The wound had long closed. “Huh. I’m fine now. Neat. Wait... were you waiting for me at my bedside?”\par
She grinned. “Aww, that's so sweet.”\par
Standing on the other side of the sickbed, Reina made a weird gagging sound.\par
"You look worried sick," Avery said to him.\par
He was astounded. How was she so calm?\par
"You almost died."\par
"It happens," she said, waving dismissively. "This is like… the third time?"\par
"This is serious."\par
She blinked, then scratched her head sheepishly. "Yeah, well… I'm alive, aren't I? I feel alright. I'm just happy I'm still kicking. Things worked out, right?”\par
They did. He supposed it wasn't as harrowing for her. She was unconscious for most of it.\par
"Hi!” said Avery. She'd just noticed Reina. She blinked big green curious eyes at her. "Who are you? Are you okay? You look kind of constipated.” \par
Reina's face twitched. "… Reina. It's a pleasure." She extended her hand, and Avery shook it. “Reina! Zane's told me all about you."\par
"Has he? Strange. He hasn't told me anything about you," said Reina, almost coldly. He frowned. She was being weird again.\par
“That's because we just met—wait." Avery looked at him, then at Reina, and then at him again. "Ohhhhhhh. I see what's going on here."\par
"What?" said Reina. "What?" said Zane at the same time.\par
"He's cute, don't get me wrong. But don't worry, he's not my type," said Avery, patting Reina's hand. "He's too big for me. You go climb that tree, sister."\par
Zane almost fell over. What?!\par
At the same time—"What?!" said Reina, reddening. "I—I don't understand what you're saying."\par
"Wait," said Avery. She looked at him, then at Reina. "Oh. Ohhhhh. He doesn't know! … Well, he didn't know… uh… oops? Sorry."\par
She patted Reina's hand again and hopped out of bed, yawning. "I'm hungry. Anyone got a bagel?"\par
Zane still hadn't recovered from that tree line. He looked at Reina, baffled. For her part, Reina wouldn't meet his eyes. She looked like she was ready to dissolve into a puddle.\par
… Was she… surely not… right?\par
"Anyway," said Zane, suddenly uncomfortable. He scrambled for something else to talk about. "It's good you're well. Reina?"\par
Reina flinched.\par
"Any news since I've been gone?"\par
It took Reina a moment to collect herself. She took a deep breath. Her face was still bright red. “Uh,” she said, which was a word she usually never said. “Right. Yes. A lot. Just what did you do at Mount Saint Helens? I've been hearing some… things. Ludicrous things."\par
"They're probably true," said Avery.\par
"Yes, well. In the past few hours half the Factions in the state have contacted us, asking to sub-Faction!"\par
***\par
There were the River Drifters, the Silent Pines, the Yakima Echoes, the Neon Blade, the Thorn Binders, the Spokane Miners Faction, and a dozen more smaller Factions littered around East and South Washington. A fair number were displaced refugee Factions needing a new home after the Legion drove them out.\par
But most of them weren't. Most of them sent messages like this:\par
Hey Luminous Faction,\par
This is Cassidy Neal. I was a riverboat captain on the Columbia before all this System stuff went down. I lead a Faction called the River Drifters. We're mostly water Mages. Congrats on your victory at Mount Saint Helens, man! If you told me one guy could take down a whole Iron Legion Division, I wouldn't have believed it. You're something special.This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
How had they heard so fast?\par
Those Legion folks've really been stepping on our toes lately, making these crazy claims on the riverfront. They'll probably annex us in the month if this goes on. Frankly, me and my guys have no desire to be part of that psycho Marcus's regime.\par
We've heard Luminous Faction has a history of freeing Factions. You treat your people well. We River Drifters would love to join you if you'll have us.\par
"The Knights of Cascadia were forced out yesterday too," Reina said. "Tom sent a message—the Legion's swarming the Cascades. I told him they could come here. We've got enough empty space."\par
"Can we absorb everyone who wants to come?" said Zane. Though he was really asking, Can you handle it?\par
Reina nodded firmly.\par
"Good," he said. He sighed. There was no going back—either the Legion went down or the Luminous Faction did. They’d need all the help they could get.\par
***\par
There was a slight awkwardness between him and Reina now. They both went on as though Avery hadn't said anything, like if they didn’t address it it might go away on its own. Though Reina's face had been pink for two hours straight. Avery herself went off doing… he wasn't sure. She'd just made a mess and vanished.\par
Reina's log cabin lay near the center of town. There, they strategized.\par
First he told her about the essence geysers in Mount Saint Helens. They needed to get on that as soon as possible. Get most of their warriors up to the Level 30s, maybe the 40s. He wasn't sure how fast the Legion would come for them. If they were bringing their whole army… he figured they had at most two weeks, likely less. With how much essence those geysers gave, even a night would do wonders.\par
If D-rank dungeons had treasures this good, what about C-rank? What about dungeons that spawned in dense cities, where hundreds of fighters could go in at once, and reap its Treasure Area rewards?\par
No wonder so many Factions got so strong so fast. The Beacon map showed the Legion had conquered their own C-ranked dungeon in Seattle. They were far ahead. And the Luminous Faction had very little time to play catch-up…\par
***\par
Reina did her best, though. By evening, everyone who'd been building, or patrolling, or tending to Treasure Areas had been diverted into strict combat roles, divvied into divisions of Rangers, healers, scouts, infantry, heavy infantry, and so on. When he caught them at dinnertime, they were drilling in the Highlands plains.\par
Word about him had gotten out too. If they were in awe of him before, it was getting silly now. Nobody came up to him anymore. He felt like a zoo animal, only to be observed at a safe distance. Everyone kept averting their eyes when they looked at him, as if they were staring at the sun. Men dipped their heads like a knee-jerk reaction. Women got flustered, looked away.\par
He kind of liked it. Nobody bothered him as he went about camp. It was nice.\par
***\par
There were so many little things he had to do before the fighting began.\par
First thing, he used his new mid-grade essence stones to upgrade the Beacon to D-rank.\par
That unlocked a wealth of benefits. For one, specialized training zones that you could site anywhere you liked. Pay for them, and the System would spawn them then and there.\par
Mage Dojo: Mage Dojos are sanctums saturated with elemental essence. They help mages practice and refine their essence control. Each Sanctum is attuned to a specific element, like fire, water, dark, or poison, providing an immersive environment for honing elemental magic. Grants a boost to Mage Skill training.\par
Ranger Dojo: Ranger Dojos are groves enchanted to mimic a plethora of wild terrains. They make perfect environments for Rangers to practice tracking, stealth, and archery. Grants a boost to Ranger Skill training.\par
Warrior Dojo: Warrior Dojos are arenas which give warriors a place to practice melee combat and tactics. They include sparring stations and Skill-resistant combat dummies. Grants a boost to Warrior Skill training.\par
Rogue Dojo: Rogue Dojos are obstacle courses designed for classes that rely on agility and acrobatics, these fields include complex obstacle courses with moving parts. Perfect for practicing parkour, evasion, and stealth maneuvers. Grants a boost to Rogue skill training.\par
Healer Dojo: Healer Dojos are serene havens which bolster concentration and mindfulness, ideal for priests and healers to practice healing spells. Grants a boost to Priest skill training.\par
You could even purchase—\par
Caverns of Insight: Meditation caverns attuned to specific Laws where cultivators can meditate and gain insight into the Universe.\par
Though they were expensive as hell.\par
The Beacon Store was also upgraded. It now offered dishes that promised permanent but small boosts to specific stats. Spirit Rockfish for Vitality, Lion's Heart for Strength, and so on. There were also minor treasures now, like cloaks that gave weak camouflage or compasses that pointed to the nearest Treasure Area. Few were worth the price.\par
He handed over his Bag of Holding, with all its mid-grade essence stones, to Reina. He trusted her to spend them wisely.\par
***\par
That evening, the most important benefit of the D-rank Beacon popped up: the larger messaging range.\par
Dear Luminous Faction,\par
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Lane Sullivan. I lead the Harbourmasters, the wardens of Vancouver and the Northern Cascades.\par
We've been at war with the Iron Legion for weeks now. This is a friendly warning: they are pulling their troops back across the American border. They will likely pull their forces on the eastern front as well. We believe they are consolidating a full army and preparing a frontal assault. Our best intelligence suggests you have a week before it strikes.\par
It would be calamitous for all of us if the Legion conquered Washington State. It is in our best interests to work together. The Harbourmasters will harass them to the north. We’ll delay their progress as best we can.\par
Before today we were on the verge of ceding our territory and evacuating. But what you have done at Mount Saint Helens gives us hope, Savage Sage.\par
We wish you the best of luck.\par
Just an hour later, he got a similar message from a lady who led a Faction called the Kootenai Rangers. They'd been defending Kootenai National Forest, using guerrilla tactics to ward off swarms of Iron Legion soldiers. They promised similar support—that they'd press the Legion to the east.\par
Neither Faction seemed to want to commit to sending troops over to wage full-on war.\par
In that, the Luminous Faction was on its own.\par
***\par
Things moved shockingly fast. The next morning, Zane was preparing to run another of his errands. He had his Law Fruit in his pocket. He meant to go check out that Sharpness Cavern of Insight to see if he could glean anything useful for his Axe.\par
Before he set off, the first of the refugee Factions arrived.\par
\par


\section{42. Poisoned Pawn}
\par
Reina asked him to stand beside her as the first batch of sub-Factions rolled in. She said he didn't need to do anything—just stand there.\par
By now things were pretty much back to normal between them. Whatever feelings Reina had, she'd suppressed them. She was all business today—Reina the Faction leader. It was a relief to him.  He liked Reina well enough, but a relationship was the last thing he needed right now.\par
\par
Reina pursed her lips, considering him. "Try to look... actually, this is good. Just look like yourself."\par
"Like what?"\par
"You know, big... strong. They'll feel safe just looking at you."\par
She flushed a little and looked away. He shrugged, pretending not to notice. "...Sure."\par
After a while standing there side by side, he felt he had to say something. To close the book. "You're a good friend, Reina."\par
A silence. Then she just nodded. "I know," she said sadly.\par
***\par
The River Drifters, the band of water mages, traipsed into camp. They were a ragtag group, all dirty and haggard, dressed in torn rags and strips of muddy cloth. They were led by Cassidy Neal, the man who'd sent Zane that Beacon message yesterday.\par
Cassidy was a tan, sandy-haired man with a nervous but genuine smile. As Reina walked him through the terms they had for joining, he couldn't seem to focus. He kept staring at Zane. All of them did. Zane had that monkey-in-zoo feeling again.\par
He realized it didn't really matter what Reina was saying. It wasn't about the terms. She was right; all they wanted was to feel safe. And she was showing him off because of it.\par
They seemed to relax just looking at him. He wasn't sure how he felt about it.\par
After Reina was done talking, he gave his usual speech. If they joined, they'd have to be self-sufficient. Unless there was an existential threat, they shouldn't expect him to get involved.\par
"But…" he shrugged. "Right now there is an existential threat. So I'll fight for you, if you'll fight for me. Deal?"\par
They signed on enthusiastically.\par
Faction: River Drifters would like to become a Sub-Faction of the Luminous Faction. Do you accept?\par
He did.\par
More sub-Factions trickled in. A lot of them were like the River Drifters: haggard but not broken. They wanted to fight. They just needed some hope.\par
***\par
There was another kind of Faction, though, that was even worse off. The Bushwackers, for instance, had been wandering the forests for weeks. They'd lost half their members running from the Legion.\par
They were pretty weepy when they came. Some of them took a look at the bustling town square, with its smoking chimneys and strong walls, and fell to their knees. When Reina offered them sanctuary, they burst into tears. They thanked her, and him, profusely. Mostly him. He stood there awkwardly as they did—some took a while.\par
They, and a few other Factions, were clearly not ready for a fight. Reina said she'd figure out support roles for them.\par
***\par
Then there were Factions like the Neon Blade—a bunch of teenage skaters and graffiti artists who'd been up in Olympia, hanging out when the Change began. They cleared their own dungeon and were happily living there until Stroud's unit drove them out. They'd been running for weeks.\par
Their leader, a tomboyish girl named Kat in a ripped-up white tee, took one look at him and said, "You're the dude who beat Stroud?"\par
He nodded. She looked him up and down, and shrugged. "Alright, we're in. Let's give those bastards hell."\par
They were full-on defiant, ready to take it to the Legion. Reina had the easiest time integrating them.\par
***\par
To every sub-Faction, Zane made it clear that Reina was in charge. If they had a problem with that, they could take it up with him.\par
No one took it up with him.\par
***\par
He went to check up on Avery before he left for the Cavern of Insight. Cale was still in charge of most 'community management' things at home base—holding town halls, hearing out grievances, planning events, that kind of thing. It included housing assignments. When Zane asked and Cale got through his usual two or three minutes of pleasantries, he said that he had indeed given a short, messy-haired girl in a hoodie a house. She'd requested somewhere hard to find—a treehouse deep in the Emerald Forest. Zane didn't find her there when he checked.This narrative has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. If you see it on Amazon, please report it.\par
He did find her on the way back. Leaned against a random tree trunk, just napping, not a care in the world. He should've figured. Napping was probably her favorite pastime. She said much of her Law insight came through dreaming, and he wasn't sure whether she was kidding or not. She treated her hoodie like a portable sleeping bag. She could sleep pretty much anywhere.\par
He didn't disturb her. He just left.\par
She tried to present herself as cheery as ever, but he could tell she was pissed she got caught. Her two main weaknesses were getting hit when she wasn't ready, and having no offense whatsoever. When they'd spoken at dinner last night, she'd sworn to shore herself up.\par
Time for him to do so too.\par
He'd go study those Laws of Sharpness. By what Avery told them, he had some serious ground to make up if he wanted to catch the Soldier of God in seven day's time.\par
***\par
Marcus Blackwell, The Soldier of God, World Rank \#44 by Level according to his C-ranked Beacon, sat on his throne and waited, grinding his teeth.\par
A dungeon boss used to sit on this throne—a 10-foot-tall Nether Golem. Marcus had cut out its undead heart with his own sword. The rest of the room had been hollowed out and redecorated, but he kept the black-iron throne. It suited him well.\par
He had a single point of light cut out of the ceiling so that a shaft of sunlight would fall on him, and only him, at all times of the day.\par
Of late a great many things troubled him. One was that Savage Sage, down in southern Washington, who'd so humiliated him Marcus had beaten one of his Generals half to death in his rage.\par
But Zane Walker was a blip on his map in the grand scheme. No serious threat. A gnat who'd be crushed before the month was out. Their power levels could not be compared.\par
The man taking his time loitering outside Marcus's throne room was a serious threat.\par
Just when Marcus was about to march out and drag the man in himself, the doors cracked open. Elias Ventor, World Rank \#24, strolled smoothly in, humming, smiling a slimy smile. As though he hadn't just made the most powerful man in the Pacific Northwest wait fifteen minutes at his pleasure.\par
Everything about him rubbed Marcus wrong. He was slim, short, sharp-featured, dressed in sleek silk robes. He wore clear glasses with no lenses. His hair was smooth with far too much product, but his eyes were what stood out about him. When you looked in them you got the sense there was no one there. Not even when he smiled.\par
Elias Ventor (Creature)\par
Signature Title: Void Seer\par
Essence Level: 84\par
Faction: Silicon Coven\par
Class: Warlock\par
"Why hello, Marcus! So sorry I'm late. How are you?"\par
Elias was utterly relaxed as he strolled in. He had the audacity to hum a tune.\par
Instantly Marcus despised him.\par
"I'm well. Thank you," said Marcus. He smiled broadly. "Elias Ventor... I've heard of you. Since before the Change, as a matter of fact."\par
"You have? Why," said Elias brightly. "You'll make me blush!"\par
"You founded that hedge fund. Ventor Nieman." \par
"Well, venture capital firm," Elias corrected. "But do go on."\par
"Tell me. Is it true that you scammed your startups out of hundreds of millions of dollars? That you stole the bulk of their profits with your predatory contracts?" said Marcus. He looked the man dead in the eyes, still smiling.\par
Elias didn't seem caught off-guard in the slightest. He didn't even look embarrassed. If anything he looked smug. "Those were baseless claims made by jealous business partners, I'm afraid. All those contracts were consensual. Perhaps they should've read the fine print."\par
Marcus was not convinced. "Now you head the San Francisco Faction. And you're Level 84. It seems the cat always lands on his feet." \par
Elias shrugged. "What can I say? I can tell where the wind's about to blow, so to speak. It's what's made me a good investor, you see."\par
His eyes glinted. "It's what makes me want to invest in you, Marcus. Of everyone in this region, you have the most potential by far. Your Skills are the most advanced. Your Laws far outstrip the competition! You're quite the remarkable man. I have a feeling we'd make great partners."\par
Marcus snorted. "I see. So you'd invest in me, just as you 'invested' in your startups. Do I seem a fool to you, Seer?"\par
"Please. You make it sound as though I lied to them! Everything was in the contract. If they didn't like the terms, perhaps they should've been more careful. But something tells me you're a careful man."\par
He smiled an oily little smile. "Will you hear me out, at least?"\par
Marcus stared him down. Elias seemed to take that as agreement.\par
The man whipped a Bag of Holding out of nowhere, as though by sleight of hand, and out came two gurgling golden vials. He waggled them about.\par
"C-grade Essence Vials," said Elias. "Extracted from a C-ranked Dungeon. Worth five Levels where you are, I imagine. Here—take them! A gift from me to you."\par
"A gift, is it? No strings attached?" Marcus could've laughed. What a little clown of a man.\par
"You wound me! No strings at all, truly," Elias set them down on the floor. "Do with them as you like. I come in good faith."\par
Marcus didn't believe that for a second.\par
Elias spread his hands. He paused. "Though… there is more where that came from. If you'd like to pursue… a closer relationship…"\par
He pulled another Bag of Holding out of thin air and dumped out its contents.\par
A gorgeous set of polished ruby armor clattered out. Helm, breastplate, greaves—the whole set head-to-toe, intricately carved. It was rare to find just one armor plate in a dungeon, much less a set.\par
Then he inspected him, and his eyes widened.\par
"Yes," said Elias, smirking. "C-grade. The Dragonscale Set, the rarest drop of a C-ranked dungeon chest! Its price… you could buy half the state with it, I imagine. With this equipped you'll be untouchable on the West Coast! Forget the Pacific Northwest. All of Canada is yours for the taking!"\par
He paused. "And all I ask is a very small share in your future. I'll have no control over you, to be sure. You'll do as you please. I merely want a one-percent stake in your future essence earnings. That's all. Quite a generous deal, if I may say so."\par
He snapped his fingers, and a black quill dropped in his fingers. "So! What do you say, Soldier of God?"\par
Marcus stared at him.\par
Then he barked a laugh and stood. Stood and walked over and towered over this little Warlock, and smiled. He leaned down so they came face-to-face.\par
"What makes you think," he breathed. "I need your help?"\par
Marcus did not respect this Elias Ventor. Not in the slightest. He chafed at the man's condescension--like he was some great patron offering to help poor needy Marcus. This was no real man. This was a little man, a man who traded off wealth and words, a slippery rat of a man. Marcus was tempted to grab him by the throat and strangle him then and there. We'll see if your tricks protect you then!\par
He restrained himself. Barely.\par
Elias sighed. "Ah, yes. I figured that'd be your answer. Well! In case you ever change your mind… and something tells me in the coming weeks, you very well might…"\par
He snapped his fingers, and a calling card fell in his open palm. He winked as he pressed it to Marcus's chest. "Do let me know."\par


\section{43. Laws of Sharpness (I) }
\par
Apparently the Law Fruit he'd found in that dungeon chest wasn't the only one.\par
Before he left, Reina presented him with a sack of them. There were five more the warriors had picked up clearing nearby F- and E- ranked dungeons. They've saved them just for him—or rather, Reina had ordered them saved for him. She felt he would make the best use of them.\par
When she handed them over, she told him, a little defensively, she only did this because it was the logical thing to do. As the strongest, he should have them.\par
When he set up his Faction, he'd never expected to get anything out of it. It was an off-the-cuff thing he gave little thought to. So this was a neat surprise.\par
***\par
After that, Zane went off to the Cavern of Insight. Things changed fast around here. He remembered thick forests here, with gnarled vines draped over the paths ready to trip him up. Instead his way went pretty smoothly. The ground had all been cleared, making for clean roads. When he passed the F-ranked Snaring Thickets dungeon, which used to be unwalkable, he found beaten paths leading to a quaint little town. Reina had installed a Ranger Grove here, a wooden dome laced with thick vines, and the bulk of the townsfolk were hard at work training inside. Readying for war.\par
A little while later, he made it to the abandoned warehouse. Similar story here. The warehouse had been converted into a warrior training ground. He heard clashing and roaring. Flashes of essence pour out the main entrance.\par
The Cavern of Insight was much like he'd remembered. No one had touched it since he'd last come—the same winding path in, the same slashes on the walls, the same dais where he imagined some great expert once sat.\par
He let out a breath. From what Avery told him about how Laws worked, he imagined this would be a lot tougher than learning his Fire Laws. For one, his Class was already attuned to Fire, as was his Soul Weapon. Sharpness was something new, something he'd just brought in.\par
He got out a Law Fruit and wolfed it down in four bites.\par
His head started to tingle. A sweet warmth spread his temple, soaked deep, past the stuff of the physical, like it was warming a part of his soul.\par
He wondered if they stacked. He took a bite of another one. That same sweet warmth soaked him again, just as strong. Huh.\par
Then he downed the rest of the Fruits.\par
His head swimming, he took a circle around the room, inspecting each of the slashes. They were even more profound than he'd remembered—now he'd glimpsed that eruption vision, that old man destroying the star, he could spot when there were depths of Law hidden beneath the surface. Depths he couldn't begin to perceive.\par
It was like that here. These Laws were nothing like whatever the old man had wielded—they were orders of magnitude less powerful—but they were still far beyond him. As Zane inspected the slashes, the Laws he grazed were minor. He felt like he was staring at icebergs—the Laws he saw were the tiniest extrusions, bobbing above the surface.\par
He could see them—sort of, lingering out there. But he couldn't feel what it meant to cut. Not truly. That was the hard part.\par
He didn't need his eyes open to see them. He could sense them at the level of the soul, hovering all around him. So, he sat down at the center of the chamber, closed his eyes, crossed his legs, and opened himself up to feeling.\par
Just as he'd done with the Heart of the Volcano, when he tried to comprehend eruption. He let himself go, let the constraints of the flesh melt away… It wasn't simple, nor easy. He'd feel an itch, a scratch, a twinge of random pain, a soft gust of wind tickling his arms, and he'd be yanked back.\par
But he kept trying. And eventually…\par
He let his mind dissolve into the universe. It felt a lot like falling asleep.\par
He woke as someone else, somewhere else. He was caught in a tattered, faded memory, all soft at the edges, blurry, but its feelings were still so intense they felt real. He was panting, running—not on ground but air. He glanced down. His shoes ran up to mid-calf, slips of embroidered silver, glowing fiercely.The tale has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\par
He ran on nothing. Nothing but air. He couldn't control it—but he could run along the current. And these were fierce currents indeed, storm currents lashed with rain, howling as they spread across the surface of a black-blue ocean, frothing with white foam.\par
His boots let him run on the winds. They hummed with wind Laws. But they were fading fast, sputtering out.\par
A stretch of black clouds hung over him, heaving with rain, groaning with thunder. His eyes were trained on the stormy sea below, watching, twitching as he ran.\par
His heart thudded in his chest. He didn't dare lose focus—not for a second.\par
Just below him, the sea began to seethe. He yelped, kicked off the air, and his boots sent him sprawling down a nearby current—just as the ocean erupted and a giant head broke the surface like a blue whale broaching, but so much bigger than a blue whale, and its mouth leered wide to show endless rows of white teeth set against a black mouth—a night sky of swirling teeth.\par
Dragon-turtle (Creature)\par
Essence Level 482\par
Holy shit!\par
More of it came out of the water, and Zane saw the turtle part of it—a great dark-gray shell that could have been an island studded with thousands of barnacles.\par
It came halfway up between the sea and the sky before it fell. The man summoned his sword, this slim blade, sleek but devastatingly sharp, and slashed.\par
A line of light whistled past, struck the dragon-turtle, and shattered to little pieces.\par
The man cursed and kept running.\par
He couldn't run much longer; his boots were giving out, his essence was giving out, his body was flagging.\par
"Has the Deep-Sea Emperor no honor?" he screamed. "To ambush a rival Chosen in such cowardly fashion?"\par
The dragon-turtle snorted, spewing brine, and fell away.\par
Now he was all desperation. Ahead, on a smudgy map—cliffs rising out of the sea. Was that a cave burrowed in the stone?\par
It was! He nearly couldn't make it out—the darkness of the cliff blended almost perfectly with the darkness of the sky. But it was there. He dashed toward it, hoping against hope, even as the sea started bubbling beneath him again.\par
Gritting his teeth, he burned out the boots for one last mad thrust. He shot like a cannon, even as the ocean erupted around him. He went tumbling through, smashing over and over on stone, and came to a sprawling, gasping, ragged halt.\par
He heard the Dragon-turtle's furious howl. Then he was thrown off his feet. He felt the whole cavern shake, the whole cliff tremble as the massive creature threw itself against it.\par
But it held.\par
For a while the man lay there, trembling, gasping. He patted for his Bag of Holding but found nothing. He hung his head.\par
He walked down the cave path, searching for a way out. None—dead end. The only thing there was a small cavern.\par
It was the very cavern Zane sat in in the real world.\par
Only its walls were blank. In the vision, the man sat at its center and waited. The dragon-turtle did not go away—he could see it on the mini-map, lurking, waiting. It didn't need to get at him; it just needed to hold him. The Deep-Sea Emperor knew where he was. When it came, he was doomed.\par
This went on for quite some time.\par
Zane wondered with slight annoyance what the owner of this vision was playing at. He lay there, trembling, head down, swamped with sadness, with hopelessness.\par
"Is this truly how it ends?" said the man. "To think! The Sage of the Crimson Edge, Chosen genius of ten thousand years—trapped and killed by an unruly local hegemon! Of a D-ranked Planet, no less!"\par
An indignant fury rose, mixing with the man's helplessness.\par
It was as though he was waiting for this 'Deep-Sea Emperor' to come end him. Why wasn't he moving? Doing something?\par
An hour later, the man did. He came to the wall and pressed a trembling finger. Then slowly, carefully, he drew a line straight down, etching a scratch into the wall.\par
Zane felt the will—concentrated on a single point, a point infinitesimally small, trembling on the tip of that finger. When it drew forth, the wall had no choice but to give.\par
Zane felt a prickling of excitement. The sensation of cutting poured through him, and he soaked it in. He tried to memorize every little contour of that cut, tried as best he could to edge every little move into the grooves of his mind—\par
The cut ended.\par
The man barely got an inch in before his essence sputtered out. The man sighed and hung his head. He baffled Zane. Surely he must see he couldn't afford to mope?\par
The man did. It took him nearly ten minutes to work up to drawing a second line. Then a third a few minutes later. Finally the man was working up to a rhythm. Over and over Zane let those Laws of cutting flow through him, permeating his mind. He sat with those feelings as though in a warm bath. They started seeping under the skin…\par
By the time the man had gotten all the way around, he was getting excited. Zane was too. They were both on the verge of something—a breakthrough.\par
The man drew his last slash and shuddered.\par
The universe rushed into his mind.\par
Zane caught none of it.\par
Like staring at static noise on a television. But when it passed, the man was on his knees, trembling.\par
"Yes," he whispered. "Yes, yes, yes!"\par
He strode toward the cavern mouth, head high. It was lit up yellow now; the storm had passed and sunlight poured into the world. He saw the dragon-turtle rear up as he came close, eager to get at him. Its massive head broke the surface.\par
The man slashed.\par
One pure-white line crossed the air and touched that Level 482 Dragon-Turtle's neck. And passed clean through.\par
The head slid off the body and crashed like a meteor into the ocean.\par
The vision ended.\par
Zane sat there, soaked through with sweat.\par
Laws Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Razor's Edge\par


\section{44. Laws of Sharpness (II) }
\par
That swordsman went from not even scratching the dragon-turtle's hide to beheading the thing.\par
That jump… it wasn’t the jump from Minor to Major. Whatever that man comprehended was at least a Tier above.\par
The higher you went, the bigger the jumps got, Zane guessed. How fun would it be to play with a Law like that?\par
For now, though…\par
Minor Law of Razor Edge. It governed the physical quality of sharpness—what made something sharp. The fine points of the world. When he gathered those Laws on his finger, held it up to the light, he knew it was sharper than any knife he’d ever owned.\par
There's no way to know for sure without testing it. He walked outside and squinted up at the sky. Still daylight, mid-afternoon if he had to guess. He made for the nearest tree and ran a finger along its trunk.\par
It cut clean through the bark, no splintering, no crackling. Just a pure, simple severing. He hardly applied any force—he just touched, and the bark gave way.\par
Fascinating. He got out his axe and touched that to the tree now. No Laws, no fire—just set the raw edge of the blade to it. Nothing happened. When he pressed even slightly, the bark gave way easily, crackling and splintering. But it wasn't like his finger.\par
When he touched the bark with his finger, it crumbled like there was nothing there—just air. And the bark didn't flex, didn't crack, like the cut was so clean the wood didn't know it’d been cut.\par
He tried putting his finger on the bark again, and it sank right in. He got a few inches in before the tree started to resist. When he pulled the finger back, it was sticky with sap.\par
He frowned at it. Then he tried coating the edge of his axe with that Razor Edge Law, and set that against the tree.\par
He swung it through and back again. It was eerie. He didn't even register he’d touched something. There was no evidence the tree had been cut at all until he prodded it and the whole thing wobbled, came tumbling over, and thudded into the ground, limb-like branches flailing.\par
So that was interesting, but it was just a tree. He was realizing he was well past the point where doing things to trees gave him much useful information.\par
Instead, he took out his axe head and just dropped it. He put a thin layer of Razor's Edge on it and let it fall.\par
It hit the ground and sank through. And kept going and going and going… it must have dropped six or seven feet into the ground before it came to a halt.\par
He tried it again with no Law, and it only got a few inches in. Half its head still stuck out of the dirt. He nodded. Neat.\par
Still, he got the feeling he could only really appreciate it once he used it in battle.\par
He looked around. Obviously, there were no Monsters nearby. All the F- and E- ranks dungeons for hundreds of miles around have been cleared long ago. Even if you found Monsters there, it would be like cutting a tree.\par
He supposed he’d just have to wait.\par
It was still daylight, and he still felt that warm Law Fruit feeling bubbling in his mind. There was maybe half of it left?\par
He went back into his cavern, sat down, and tried meditating again. With luck, he could squeeze another Law out of this.\par
He settled down. It was easier this time to dissolve, to let himself fall into memory…\par
It turned out to be the same one, repeated. Maybe it was the only one stored in this Cavern of Insight.\par
This time, it was easier to distinguish between himself and the swordsman. He was still limited to what the swordsman saw and heard and felt, but he could focus elsewhere in the scene. While the swordsman scoured the raging waters, Zane noticed the man's clothes, caught glimpses of a crest embroidered at the wrists. A lot like what that old man he'd seen in the Heart of the Volcano. But the swordsman's crest was a cloud.\par
Did it mean different Factions?\par
The dragon-turtle was as breathtaking as the first time Zane saw it. It felt like staring down a mountain face. How could a single sword strike cut through that thing's neck? Whatever power that swordsman had gained, it flew way over Zane’s head. \par
The swordsman dashed into the cliffs again. Outside was a swirling stormy world, but inside it was exactly the same as what Zane saw. How did this cave get lifted from there to here? Was it the same cave, or was it a copy?\par
The swordsman was kneeling and moping again. “Is this truly how it ends?” whispered the man. “To think! The Sage of the Crimson Edge, chosen genius of ten thousand years—cornered, and assassinated, by an unruly local hegemon! Of a D-ranked Planet, no less!”\par
He spat out the word D-ranked. So he was from some better planet, then. \par
Who exactly was this? Again, Zane had no sense of scale—'genius of 10,000 years' meant very little to him. He got the strange sense he was looking at someone important. Eh.This story has been stolen from Royal Road. If you read it on Amazon, please report it\par
The man got to his sword work. Line after line came up on the walls, but this time Zane filtered the sensations. The mountains focused on the sharpness of the point, but that wasn't all he felt. There was also the way his fingers moved, smoothly, cleanly in one stroke. It didn't start at the fingertip. It flowed from the arm, down the hips, starting from the feet, rising up the body. In a way, the finger made the slash; in another way, the arm did; in another way, the whole body did. They were all instruments of each other, flowing seamlessly in beautiful clean lines. As though guided on some unseen path, a path of Law.\par
If this man added a sword, that sword would be just another instrument. It was no different than the fingertip, nor the elbow, in principle.\par
Zane focused on how it flowed back and forth, smooth, one unbroken arc…\par
And when the man went out to face that dragon-turtle again, Zane put all his attention on how that slash carved up the skin. Like a crescent moon, so perfectly smooth… There was a sense of precision there, of exactness, of perfect geometries…\par
The scene faded.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Precision Slicing\par
Odd how there was no bracket next to this one signaling its Elemental Law—did it not belong to any particular one?\par
He breathed out. He felt weary, yet his head was also perfectly clear. The Law Fruit had run its course, and he felt empty. He tried closing his eyes and dissolving into a third trance, but this time it felt sluggish, like he was trying to claw his way in. He couldn't let go. You can't make yourself dream. He could tell he was done for the day—without special circumstances like treasures, his comprehension was much too slow. If he wanted more, he figured he’d have to see about getting more Law treasures. \par
He stood and traced a few experimental arcs, curious… When he applied the Law of Precision Striking, he could make his finger move like he was tracing a stencil. It poured all his force exactly where it needed to go. Quick, efficient, clean strokes.\par
And it wasn't just physical mastery. He sensed the universe had a part to play. Had he made the same move without this Law, his body might move perfectly, but depending on the material, the texture, the hardness, the cut might come out awkward and strange.\par
As he came up to the craggy cave wall and scratched out a line, it went perfectly smooth, no bumps.\par
Again—neat stuff. More testing needed… Later. In battle, sometime. \par
He stood and made for the cave entrance. Moonlight spilled over the mouth, pooling on the craggy floor. \par
It was about time he made his way home.\par
*** \par
When he got back, he found the base camp was overrun with tents. There were so many they sprawled into neighboring Safe Zones—it was starting to look like a proper army. They sat in their own little circles, one for each division, eating dinner around their own little fires. For tonight, Reina had forked out the essence stones. She gave everyone a real feast—people munched on huge legs of beef and racks of mutton, all soaked through with essence. They laughed, told stories; as Zane passed he gathered most were sharing how they’d all gotten here. A few sang old pop songs. \par
There was a warmth in their faces now, a joy Zane hardly seen on any of them even just this morning. But they'd gone from homeless and shattered and alone to part of some massive movement, a movement they could see sprawling out across the hills with their own eyes. They had a community now. They had hope. \par
As Zane passed, a few eagle-eyed folk pointed him out and raised toasts to him, cheered him. He nodded. He still wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. Bow? Smile and wave? It wasn't really him.\par
Reina met him as soon as he got to the town square. “We have a bit of a problem,” she said.\par
***\par
The problem sat on the outskirts of the main square.\par
Ethan Lineker \par
Essence Level 58 \par
Faction: Dawn Guard \par
Class: Blood Berserker\par
He must have been in his late 30s, a bearded, rough-looking man. He wasn’t as tall as Zane but he was wider, thicker, built like a grizzly bear, and he was draped in a cloak that could’ve been bear fur too.\par
And behind him were hundreds of men and women sat around their own little fires, all in furs like him. Their Levels were surprisingly high—in the 30s and 40s, about as strong as the Luminous Faction’s strongest. Barring Zane, of course.\par
They looked to him with a mixture of hope and wariness.\par
Ethan Lineker seemed neither aggressive nor scared as Zane walked up. Just pensive.\par
“Reina tells me you want to join,” said Zane. “But she says you have a condition.”\par
“That’s right,” rasped Ethan. He stood, and looked at Zane with calm gray eyes. “The name’s Ethan. I lead the Dawn Guard. You’re the one they call Savage Sage.”\par
Zane nodded.\par
“Well,” said Ethan. “First, I should thank you. We were camped out in the Upper Cascades when that Legion General hit us. Drove us all the way down to Mt. Rainier. We used to be four hundred strong. By then they’d whittled us to under two hundred. Probably would’ve finished us if they weren’t diverted. To kill you, actually.”\par
Zane shrugged. “Sure.”\par
“I hear they bit off more than they could chew,” Ethan continued. He crossed his burly arms. “They say you’re the real deal. Now—don’t get me wrong. I don’t mean disrespect. But…” He jerked his head at his Faction. “I’m not trusting my folks to you off just that. You understand. I’ll need to see it for myself.”\par
“What, then?”\par
“A duel,” he said simply. “Friendly duel. First to 25\%. You and me. You win, I’ll swear full allegiance to you, no question. All my fighters, all my people, are yours.”\par
Zane thought about it. He supposed it was reasonable. “Alright. Tomorrow, at dawn?”\par
“At dawn,” said Ethan. They shook firmly on it.\par
*** \par
Later that night, Reina dropped by his tent as he sat there, meditating on his new Laws.\par
Time passed oddly quickly whenever he did. He could slip into a flow state and not drag himself out for hours. But he blinked, got up, and opened the door for her when she knocked.\par
“Everyone knows by now,” she said. “Most of our new sub-Factions have never seen you fight. They’re curious… you’ll have an audience.”\par
It didn’t matter to him. \par
“I’ll win,” he said. \par
“I know you will,” said Reina instantly. “I believe in you, you know that. But some of them… they’re settling, but…” \par
Reina looked out over the rolling Highland hills dotted with little fires, stretching into the Emerald Forest and beyond. “Some of them are still nervous, deep-down. They’re scared, Zane. They need to see how strong you are. It’s like Ethan said, they need to see it to believe. They need a show of force.” \par
“Hmm.” \par
He’d been thinking of it as a fun chance to practice his new Laws. He could hardly do that if he wiped the man out of the arena…\par
But maybe there was a way to do both.\par
\par


\section{45. The Duel }
\par
At dawn it as as though the whole Faction had gathered to watch Zane fight. He was reminded, weirdly, of a college football game. Last night Reina had spread the news. Everyone knew it would take place in the Valley of the Crystalback Behemoth. All across the wide lip of the valley crowded hundreds upon hundreds of people from all sorts of sub-Factions. Maybe thousands. Some had made the journey from Safe Zones hours over. There was an air of breathless excitement. \par
As Zane made his way down to the valley floor, somewhat mystified by it all, a great cheer went up for him, bubbling around the Valley's edge. There were lots of folks shouting his name, cheering him on, folks he was fairly certain he'd never met before.\par
He caught a flash of something huge and pink waving in the crowd—it was his face, blown up ten feet tall. A girl in a hoodie waved it enthusiastically. "Go Zane!" cheered Avery. She grinned and waved at him. "Woooo!"\par
He met Ethan at the center of the valley. Reina was waiting for them. \par
Zane looked Ethan dead in the eyes. The man’s brows were furrowed. He seemed tense, but he held Zane's gaze firmly. They both took the crystals, tied them around their wrists, and made for opposite sides of the valley.\par
Reina met his eyes and nodded. She seemed more nervous than he did. But she gave him a stern nod as she walked away. Once they’d all taken their spots, she called out—\par
“Fighters ready?”\par
Ethan made a fist. Zane did too.\par
“Begin!”\par
***\par
There was a presence to this Savage Sage, Ethan thought. Part of it was physical, sure—he had the kind of look that drew double-takes. But it was also the way he presented himself, his expression. There must’ve been thousands of people shouting their lungs off up there. His reputation, his Faction, was riding on him. And the man looked calm, almost bored, like he felt no pressure at all. He seemed more curious than anything.\par
Ethan couldn’t tell if he was confident or foolish. \par
Ethan let out a humph. He put up his fists. His gauntlets, his Spirit Weapons, wrapped his hands. Ethan might be Level 58—something of a leap from Zane's own, sure. But there was something Zane didn't know.\par
Ethan was a one-on-one specialist. When General Clay’s Lieutenants tried to take him down face to face, they couldn't. He'd been battering that swordsman, had driven the man to his knees—they'd all had to gang up on him, push him back. It might have just been his pride talking, but if he didn't have to drop back to protect his folk, he figured he could have taken them all down with him.\par
He could tell Zane was looking down on him. If Ethan was honest, it pissed him off a little. But he didn't show it.\par
Instead, he narrowed his eyes.\par
Look down on me if you like. He’d pay for it soon enough. \par
This Zane might be strong… but one man, taking down a whole Iron Legion division? \par
Something felt fishy to Ethan. It was why he’d requested the duel. We’ll see if you can back up your reputation, Savage Sage. \par
“Begin!”\par
Instantly, Ethan activated Blood Fury.\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
But then—\par
Strength increased by 15\%\par
Speed increased by 15\%\par
It had been a stroke of blind luck getting the skill. As far as he could tell, it was one of the best Rare skills around. Cut some health, but what it meant was he was instantly fighting like a man seven or eight Levels higher.\par
It was enough to turn a fight upside-down.\par
The boost would last a minute at most. He had to make it count—he’d finish this fast. He dashed straight for Zane, eating up the ground between them in three massive bounds.\par
Zane stood his ground. Ethan wasn't slowing down. There was only one way this could end—they collided.\par
They hit each other at almost the same time. Ethan landed first—he dug his fist straight into Zane’s thick gut, and was pleased to draw a grunt. Then he pulled out the first of his weapons. Minor Law of Life Stealing!\par
And a chunk of the damage he'd dealt flowed straight back into him.\par
Then Zane’s fist struck his face.\par
It was the oddest thing—Zane’s hands were massive. He'd expected it to feel like getting struck by a battering ram. Instead, it felt like an axe had chopped deep into his face. The sudden flare of pain made him hiss, stumble back. An arc of blood spurted out.\par
They circled each other, both wary. Then Ethan lunged again and they exchanged blows—blow for blow. Ethan decked him up high, the hard steel of his gauntlets crunching against the man's cheekbones, and felt a fist gouge into his gut. They struck again and again. Back and forth they went.\par
Ethan was shocked at how evenly matched they were, even with his boost. He hopped back, dragging in a rattling breath. He was bleeding all over the place. The other man hardly looked fazed, but light bruising was showing on his face.\par
Ethan pressed in again, but this time his fists found air. Zane had dodged, clocked him up the face again, and he hissed as another slash gouged into his cheek, making a bloody X.\par
He lunged again and this time managed to land a clean shot to the body. But Zane’s reply nearly took an eye out—it would have if he hadn't jerked his head out of the way at the last minute. He was struck by how cleanly the man moved. He was huge, but his body moved like a dancer's, in big smooth lines.The tale has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\par
They clashed again, and it was getting clear the big man was getting the better of the exchanges. The crowd was eating it up.\par
Ethan's Minor Law meant they were still pretty neck and neck. If this kept up… it was looking like Ethan would lose. \par
It didn't matter. Ethan gritted his teeth. He just had to get the man down near 50\%.\par
Once Ethan was close enough to pull out his greatest weapon, this would all be over.\par
Zane was strong. Maybe stronger than Ethan, his final weapon aside. But if Ethan was honest… he was disappointed. Zane was barely beating a guy like him—how could this Zane possibly stand against the Soldier of God?\par
Ethan was starting to think he made a mistake agreeing to serve him if he lost.\par
Good thing he wouldn't lose. The more he fought, the more sure of it he felt.\par
***\par
So that's how you wrap the Razor's Edge around your knuckles. Zane nodded. \par
Sometimes these Laws felt like buying new cars. You had to test drive them to feel comfortable using them. It turned out Razor's Edge paired pretty easily with Precision Slicing—one was the what, the other was the how.\par
Ethan kept rushing in, and Zane kept hitting him. Not too hard, just enough to be comfortably winning. He wanted to get in a few dozen live shots with his new Laws, at least. The other guy got a few lumps in, but Zane didn't mind. He was learning a lot. Field tests were the way to go. It was pretty fun, actually.\par
Then he saw Reina's face. She'd gone all pink; her chest was heaving. …She seemed mad. \par
*** \par
Reina was furious.\par
What was he doing?!\par
She knew he could end that man. Couldn't he see? Everyone was watching him! She needed him to show them what she saw.\par
Why was he letting that lumbering bear of a man hit him?\par
Every time Zane took a hit, her heart sank. He didn't look concerned at all. He looked like he was taking a stroll in the park. Why did she bother being so worried for him when he wasn't worried himself?\par
Sometimes he made her feel like she was going insane.\par
The dumb hunk looked at her and blinked, baffled. \par
She wanted to scream at him.\par
***\par
Ethan staggered back, panting hard. A stream of blood dripped down his brow; he wiped it away with a hand. “Good fight,” he said.\par
“Yeah.” Zane nodded. He was having a good time. He wasn't panting, but he had to give the man credit—he was pretty solid, and he fought viciously. He was standing his ground. He'd gotten Zane close to 50\% health.\par
Then Ethan smiled. His demeanor suddenly changed. He straightened up. "I must admit, though… I’ve been holding back."\par
"Have you?"\par
“You fought well,” was all Ethan said in response. \par
Then he closed his fists, and his gauntlets started to shine a bloody red light. The air around them began to tremble. Crimson light gushed from his eyes, and the smile widened. A strange, otherworldly aura came over him; the ends of his lanky hair began to shiver and float, tinged red. Essence poured into his fists faster and faster, until those gauntlets shone like small red suns.\par
Oh, neat. It was probably something like Zane's Titan's Fist, just made for a gauntlet. He wondered how it—\par
Ethan was a blur of red light. Blink and you would’ve missed him. One instant he was ten feet away, charging up the strike. The next, he was right in Zane's face, fist cocked back, ready to blast him into oblivion. And there was some fight-ending power in that fist. If that landed, Zane really might lose.\par
Only… it seemed Ethan's fist couldn't move.\par
 The man's face went from triumphant to baffled. He stared at his hand. Then he fell over, gasping, and all that force exploded into the ground. The roar was deafening; up came a plume of smoke. But when it cleared… everyone saw the culprit.\par
Ethan's gauntleted fist lay at the bottom of a smoking crater. And around it, wrapping it tight, was a thick black chain topped with an Axe head. It chained him to the ground. Ethan tried yanking it out. He couldn't. He looked shocked at how heavy it was.\par
“What the fuck?” he grunted, eyes wide.\par
Then Zane strolled up to him. “Yeah,” he said blandly. “I was holding back too.”\par
He took his other chain and thrust it into the air. The Axe made one bright, lazy circle after another. Its edge caught on fire.\par
Ignition, Combustion, Eruption, Undying Flame, Laws stacked one atop of each other, topping the edge of that shining blade, and a Major Law exerted its pressure on the world.\par
Gasps rippled down the crowd. Ethan choked.\par
Then Zane stacked on another Law. The Minor Law of Razor’s Edge. And another, the Minor Law of Precision Slicing.\par
All six Laws flared proud atop that shining beacon of light. No one could tear their eyes from it. They could all feel it, the sheer power flowing off it, warping the air.\par
Ethan tried squirming out. But the Chains snaked around his legs, his arms, his torso—this Strength-specialist Warrior sub-class could hardly manage a few wriggles. \par
Zane brought it down to earth and clasped the base of it in one hand. He knelt down and positioned that blade, big as a car door, right over Ethan’s sweating head. It was hard to tell how much of the redness came from his face, and how much came from Zane’s Axe.\par
“So,” he said. “Do you yield?”\par
“…Yes,” breathed the man.\par
“Cool.”\par
Zane extinguished the blade, tossed it aside, de-summoned the Chains. Then he held out a hand to help the man up. Dazed, Ethan took it. “You fought well,” said Zane.\par
The crowd erupted. People fell over themselves cheering. People were running down the edges of the valley, coming to mob him.\par
“Jesus Christ,” said Ethan, wiping his face. He chuckled. “You were playing with me that whole time? You bastard. How much power was that?” \par
Zane thought. “…Thirty percent?”\par
“Jesus Christ,” said Ethan again. He shook his head. “You’re something else.” \par
He looked back at his sub-Faction, stationed on the other end of the valley.\par
They knelt as one. He did too.\par
The Dawn Guard would like to become a sub-Faction of the Luminous Faction\par
Accept? \par
Then Zane found himself mobbed by a very enthusiastic crowd he frankly had no clue what to do with.\par
It took him a while to extricate himself.\par
***\par
When at last he managed it, Reina came marching up to him.\par
“Hey,” he said. “I—”\par
She slapped him. “You ass!”\par
“…I won,” he said, baffled.\par
“Did you have to play with me like that?” She looked relieved and angry at once. “You worried me sick!” \par
“…Oh.”\par
“I—” Reina let out a frustrated growl and looked away. “It’s… It’s my own stupid fault. I don’t know why I care. You did well.”\par
She marched off.\par
Avery came over soon after, sucking on a lollipop she’d gotten from who knew where. Zane was pretty sure the Beacon shop didn’t sell those.\par
“Nice job!”\par
“Thanks.”\par
“Did you like my banner?"\par
He smiled a little. “Sure.” \par
“I was thinking we could—” Avery blinked. Then frowned. \par
“Wait…who’s that?” \par
She wasn’t looking anywhere in particular—her eyes were unfocused, staring at her mini-map. He looked at his too. \par
At its edge, moving closer, was a white dot with an S in the middle.\par
\par


\section{46. The Deal}
\par
Zane and Avery set out to meet the Signed. The Signed was walking through the lair of the Keeper of the Forest—a barren wasteland. The only place in the Safe Zone that hadn't been settled.\par
It turned out to be a thin man, slickly dressed, with blonde hair combed back in tight curls. He smiled as he sauntered through the forest. He'd been taking his time waiting for them.\par
"Morning!" he said cheerfully. "Some party you've got going on there. Congrats on the victory, by the way. Nicely done."\par
Elias Ventor  (Creature)\par
Signature Title: Void Seer  \par
Essence Level: 84  \par
Faction: Silicon Coven  \par
Class: Warlock\par
Zane and Avery both froze. The man seemed not to notice. “The name's Elias,” he said, putting his hands up in surrender, smiling. “I know what you're thinking—I'm a trespasser. I'm high Level. Look, I just want to talk. I come in peace.” \par
“What are you doing in my territory?” said Zane softly. \par
“I’ve been taking a tour up the West Coast. You know, sightseeing, making new friends, scouting certain people of note. People who’ve caught my eye.” \par
“And Zane's one of them?” said Avery.\par
“Oh, yes,” Elias's eyes twinkled, not in an innocent, grandfatherly way. He seemed like a wolf that’d just caught a scent. “Zane’s very interesting. I should say—before I was Elias Ventor, Void Seer, I was Elias Ventor, famed investor. You may have heard of me.” \par
They stared blankly at him. \par
He gave a hapless little grin and carried on. “Point is, I’m very good at spotting potential in people. People like you, Zane.” \par
“I see,” said Zane.\par
“…What about me?” said Avery. She looked a little miffed.\par
“Ah… I'm not as familiar,” said Elias, smiling apologetically. “I'm sure you have great potential, Miss Lively. It's only that, of all those I've heard of in the Pacific Northwest—Zane, you stand out as the greatest. By far.”\par
That sounded… off to Zane. Something about the way this man talked, the way he smiled... It was all very slick. \par
"Hold on a minute. Now, look," said Avery, "Zane's my guy and all. But… you looked at the Soldier and him, and thought—this is the guy? By far? No offense." She said that last bit to Zane. Zane shrugged. “None taken.” He’d been wondering the same thing.\par
“Oh, of course!” said Elias, smiling wider. “Potential measures what you can be. You have to look at where you began. Zane, you got the shit end of the draw. You were stuck in the middle of nowhere, alone, in an E- and F- rank wasteland! Why, the Soldier—he and his armies had access to C-rank dungeons since week four. The Treasure Areas there practically fed him Levels. A night there’s like clearing dozens of E-rank dungeons. You ever seen Iron Man? Tony Stark in the cave, with the scraps…? Great movie. Never mind.” \par
The man had done his research.\par
“Look at me, for instance,” Elias continued. “I was in a skyscraper when the Change happened. My first dungeon was an F- rank. Cleared it with hundreds of my employees at my side. Then we found an E-rank filled with essence saunas—these massive saunas of…well… essence. We were all in the 30s before the first week was out. Snowballed from there.” \par
Hundreds? Zane had never seriously entertained the thought of bringing massive parties in. Probably because they’d take the fun out of it. If the goal was only quick dungeon-clearing, it made sense. \par
“Hell, if you dropped me where you are?” Elias shrugged. “I'd barely be scraping the 40s! You hardly have a D-ranked dungeon to your name—not one C-rank. And for your team, nobody of note except for Miss Lively here—a great asset, I’m sure. But nothing like the firepower we’re used to in the big cities. Which is all to say… yes, Zane. I find you very, very interesting.” \par
“I see,” said Zane.\par
"It's not just your Level. It's your Laws. Now, Signed have a much higher comprehension rate than commoners, but even for a Signed—six Minor Laws and one Major, that fast? Rare. Very rare.” This narrative has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. If you see it on Amazon, please report it.\par
“I have eight,” said Avery, hands on her hips. She still seemed miffed she’d been left out. \par
“Do you, now?” Elias blinked. And then that oily smile came up again. “Well then! Perhaps I can make you an offer too.”\par
“What offer?” \par
“I saw your fight from afar,” said the man. “I figure this might be of use to you.”\par
He tapped his Bag of Holding, and out came a smooth grey brick. Its surface was lightly reflective. It looked expensive.\par
“Here.” He tossed it, and Zane caught it on instinct.\par
Fuxi’s Whetstone (C) \par
 \par
Imbued with Laws of Sharpness and Durability alike, this treasure allows the user to practice the Major Law of Sharpness across physical and essence surfaces, speeding Comprehension greatly. This Major Law is integral to both the Elemental Laws of Wind and Steel.\par
 \par
…It was exactly what Zane needed. \par
“It's a gift!” said Elias. “Go on, take it. I have lots more in here.” He slapped his bag of holding. “Speaking of…”\par
Out came a vial of bubbling white essence, stoppered with a cork. “For you, Miss Lively. Where you're at, this should be worth… oh… six or seven Levels? Four delvers died getting that vial, you know. Do use it well.” He tossed it at her, too, and she snatched it out of the air, squinting at it.\par
“Huh,” she said. “…Looks legit.” She seemed surprised. “What's the catch?”\par
“Must there be a catch?” said Elias, sighing. “Very well! Say the catch is your friendship, if you must. Here, a final gift then—Marcus will land on the shores of Olympia in less than three days.”\par
Zane jerked up. “We’ve heard different.” \par
“Then you’ve heard old news. He's rushing this. He's very, very angry. He's massing his armies in Seattle. He just needs the big cruiser they've got to return from its trip up north. Then they’ll load in all their men, sail down the Sound in the night, catch you off guard, and wipe you off the face of the earth. That's the plan, at least.” \par
Both Zane and Avery were looking suspiciously at him now. He held up his palms.\par
“Look, believe me or don’t! You have ways of checking, surely. Allies in nearby Safe Zones? Send out some feelers, gather some intel. I think you'll be surprised. I’ve got no dog in this race—just thought I'd let you know, friend to friend.”\par
“Friend, huh,” said Zane. \par
“Of course,” Elias continued. “Though… there's more where those gifts came from…”\par
He reached into another robe pocket, pulled out another bag of holding, and tapped it. Out came another vial—this one twice as big as the last, and its contents glowed an eerie purple.\par
“Now this,” he said fondly, “This is a little treasure I'm frankly loath to give up. B-grade Essence Elixir. I've cleared just one B-ranked dungeon, and nearly died doing it! This was one of the treasures in its dungeon chest. If you take this, it'll boost you, oh, I don't know… ten Levels? If I take this, I'll be two or three Levels higher. Enough to clear top 15 in the World Rankings!” \par
He waggled it in Zane's face. “Take this, study that treasure well, and all your Iron Legion worries go away. You’ll wipe them off the map. Like that.” He snapped his fingers. “Though…”\par
He paused. That oily smile came back. “This… I'm afraid I can't just give out for free.”\par
“What do you want?” said Zane, cocking a brow.\par
“Oh, just a 4\% stake in your future essence earnings. A very small, non-controlling share. An excellent deal, if I do say so myself, even if there were not a life-threatening threat looming at your doorstep… and there is, isn't there? Coming in less than three days’ time… I don’t know. If I were you, I’d want as much help as I could get.” \par
He whipped a black feather quill out of nowhere. “So what do you say?”\par
Zane frowned at him. “You want me to sign something?”\par
“Just a soul contract. To make things official. You understand.” \par
Zane and Avery exchanged a look.\par
“Let us talk about this,” he said.\par
“Sure, sure. I'll go stand by that tree over there.” Elias walked away, humming.\par
Then, at almost the exact same time, they said to one another, “I don't trust him.”\par
“I don't know,” said Avery. “He dresses well, but he talks like my sleazy uncle. I don't like it. The ‘soul contract’ stuff...” She wrinkled her nose. “Smells rotten to me.”\par
“Agreed,” he said.\par
Only—if the offer was real—it could make a difference. He wasn't sure how strong the soldier was, but from what Avery described, there was still some gulf between Zane and the man. If it took Zane and Avery to match him, could Reina really hold off all the rest of his divisions?\par
Zane got the feeling, though, that if he signed a contract with this man, he'd be agreeing to a lot more than he meant to.\par
“I don't believe a word he says. We don't need him,” Avery said. She slapped him on the back. “You got this, big fella.”\par
He shrugged. So, it was decided.\par
When Elias came back, they set down all the things he'd given them. “You can take your gifts,” said Avery, primly. “We decline your offer.”\par
Zane was a little tense. There was always the possibility that the man got violent—though, this close to enemy turf, with multiple Signed against him… Still, he had almost twenty Levels on Zane. That was serious.\par
But Elias seemed to take no offense. He just smiled. “I figured. Well, I'll drop by in a week or so… I have a feeling you’ll be more receptive to me then. Do keep the gifts! I was serious when I said they were a gesture of goodwill. I have a feeling you'll make good use of them.”\par
He bowed and made to leave.\par
“Wait,” Avery piped up. “Where’d you get all these treasures?”\par
Elias just smiled. “Some kind people gifted them to me. See you soon.”\par
Waving, he left.\par
\par


\section{47. The Calm Before the Storm }
\par
When Zane told Reina what had happened, she was shaken someone managed to get so close without tripping any of their alarms. But there was no time to worry about it now. \par
Just hours later, Reina asked the Harbourmasters in Vancouver, and they confirmed it. The Legion was pulling their galleons from up north, sailing them back to the Sound.\par
Elias was right.\par
Instantly Reina called an emergency meeting of the sub-faction heads, and started planning for war. They’d meet the galleons as they landed on the beaches. To catch them off guard instead of the other way around. A scent of jittery nervousness hung over the camp. Now the warriors were all out in the field, honing their maneuvers, coordinating their lines, making last-minute adjustments. The Rangers were out doing the same—stood in ragged lines, loosing volley after volley at empty patches of dirt. The Rogues dashed in after, picking at imaginary enemies. The Healers swooped in to support. War prep had reached its final stages.\par
It was that way for Zane, too. The best thing he could do now was to gather as many Laws and Levels as he could in the very little time he had left. \par
He could sense the fear, the hope with which everyone was looking at him. He saw Annie, the little girl he’d saved way back when, in a batch of elderly and young ones, the only non-fighters—all headed to barricade in Mount Saint Helens. They were all counting on him. The other fighters were all counting on him. Against forces that dwarfed their own, against a Signed with nearly ten Levels on him, and who knew what else…\par
He got to work.\par
First, Avery gave the elixir Elias had gifted her to him. She said Levels were less important than Laws for her. "Besides—you'll be the one taking lumps. We want you as big as you can get. You can pay me back after we beat up Marcus and take all his stuff.” She winked. \par
Zane took the vial and inspected it.\par
Vial of Essence (C)\par
A vial of pure distilled high-grade essence. Sure to grant great boosts up until the Foundation stage bottleneck\par
That last bit meant little to Zane, but it didn't sound suspicious. This had all the markings of a real treasure. Had that Void Seer been telling the truth? Were these just gifts?\par
The Vial and the Whetstone were his only ways to make any meaningful progress before the battle started. There was a chance this Elias was working for the Soldier... it didn't make much sense. Elias was the higher-Leveled one. And from what Reina’d gathered, he ran his own Faction down in SF—it seemed odd he’d be playing errand-boy. And why would he leak the Soldier's real plans?\par
It wasn't as though the Soldier needed any help crushing Zane and his Faction. Avery figured Marcus was very confident already, maybe overconfident. It was one of the few things they had on him.\par
Zane weighed the odds. He talked it over with Reina. In the end he decided to use the treasures. In a way, Elias was right—he could use all the boosts he could get. He uncorked the vial and drank it all in three smooth gulps.\par
It tasted sweet in the mouth and went down easily, like a warm shake. He felt it tingling in his head, spreading down his arms and legs in a thick rush, until his whole body tingled with the warmth. It just kept pouring in, warming him, heating him until beads of sweat started forming on his temple. He started to redden—it was a lot, all at once—\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 65 -> 66\par
The sweating had spread down his body, too. He felt a little like a crab in a boiling pot. There was so much essence; he was cooking in it. When he opened his mouth, dewy streams of it leaked out.\par
He sat there, brows furrowed, letting his body draw it in... the minutes trickled by. \par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 66 -> 67\par
Then the feverish feeling started to ebb. He wiped cold sweat from his brow and breathed out. Slowly, his body was cooling. Essence no longer ran rampant in him. The last of it still lingered, swirling around, but it was seeping in slowly but surely...\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 67 -> 68\par
He sat there a good half hour longer, just absorbing, but it wasn't nearly enough for another Level. Shaking his head, he stood. He poured all the stat points he had just gotten into Vitality.\par
When he checked, it looked like:\par
Zane Walker\par
Essence Level 68\par
Signature Title: Savage Sage\par
Class: Infernal Mauler\par
\par
Vitality: 62.83\par
Regeneration: 21.1\par
Strength: 73.37\par
Dexterity: 29.4\par
Speed: 23.8\par
\par
This was likely what he'd be working with going into battle.\par
From how huge that essence influx was, he was surprised it wasn't more. He would’ve thought he'd hit 70 with how fast he gained at the start. But each Level truly was a higher mountain.\par
At this rate, it would take about as much essence to go from level 0 to 50 as it was from 99 to 100, Zane guessed.\par
***\par
Zane marched back to his Cavern of Insight. The best thing he could do now was grind his Laws. He took out Fuxi’s Whetstone and sat down with it at the Cavern's center. He set that huge silver block down before him and studied it.If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
When he touched it, tried to connect with it, he could instantly tell this wasn't like the Heart of the Volcano. Nor was it like this Cavern of Insight. There was no ‘Law vision’ hiding in this thing—he felt no depths to it; it was exactly what it presented as. It was profound in a much more mundane way. A training dummy.\par
He set it down and slashed it with the Law of Razor's Edge.\par
It left a deep groove in the stone. Then the cut melted away, like the stone was healing itself, and it was whole again. He blinked at it.\par
In that cut, he felt his Law of Sharpness resonating against the Sharpness in the stone—like two musical notes in harmony. Only the Laws in the stone were richer, more complete.\par
He cut again, and he felt it more clearly. Yes. There was a void between what he knew and what the stone knew.\par
This was incredibly useful in a way that wasn’t obvious until he tried it. It defined the shape of what he had to learn. He saw now his Law of Precision Slicing, and his Law of Razor's Edge, made up about half of what there was to know.\par
Without this he might’ve spent days groping around in the dark. \par
He breathed out. Two Laws to go, then. Two days to learn them, until they'd have to start marching.\par
He could sense the Major Law hovering there, just out of sight of his mind's eye... He had to get to it. He ran the odds.\par
If he and Avery took on the Soldier of God, that left Reina to fight the rest of Marcus's divisions. Even if she caught them off guard, even with the help of all their new Sub-Factions, she was outmatched. They were done.\par
If, on the other hand, Zane could hold a Soldier of God by himself… that freed Avery to wreak havoc on the rest of Marcus's army. If she and the rest of the Luminous Faction could deny them a clean landing, beat them back... They had a chance.\par
Zane was looking forward to dueling Marcus. The thought got his blood boiling, brought a smile to his face. Only...\par
The Level difference between he and the Soldier of God was still at least five or six. And the Soldier was also a Signed. Avery tried to act blasé whenever she spoke of him, but Zane could tell the man scared her, deep down. From what Zane gathered, he was a hell of a fighter.\par
When Zane asked Avery for her honest opinion on whether or not Zane was a match for him, she hesitated. And then said, even now... Zane would have a rough time. \par
Zane was good, sure. But Zane wasn't on the level of someone ranked Top 50 in the world. Yet.\par
The only way he could make this a good fight? He needed that second Major Law, probably… Time was ticking.\par
***\par
Again and again, Zane slashed at the Whetstone. He threw in a Razor's Edge, he threw in Precision Striking, and then both at once. He saw them heal like old wounds and slashed again. He could feel what he needed—something just next to it, but oddly out of reach…he wasn't thinking about it right. He slashed and he slashed. He just wasn't feeling it.\par
He wasn't sure how long he sat there, slashing, frowning. It was hard to tell time once he got deep in a Law trance.\par
What was he missing? He wasn't going to find it just sitting here. Sighing, a little frustrated, he stood and walked outside, and took a breath of the chill, crisp night air. … Was it night already? Damn.\par
He breathed out again and saw his breath frosting, drawing a misty veil over the twinkling stars…\par
If he didn't get this, it would spell the end for his faction; it would put Raina and Avery in danger. Failure was not acceptable.\par
After their duel, Ethan, grizzled leader of the Dawn Guard, had asked him if he didn't feel pressure. "You sure don't look like it," the man had said, chuckling. But Zane did feel pressure. He felt the weight of the audience on him in that fight—only somehow it made him calmer, more clear-thinking. It was an invigorating pressure. It focused him. He felt it now, and smiled a little.\par
Then he marched back into the Cavern and sat down, looking at the Whetstone with fresh eyes. He slashed, slashed again. The world faded to white lines, drawn over and over… \par
No.\par
Not a line, a dot. He saw it in the stone—he saw what he had to feel, what he had to do. All this time, he was trying to cut through. But he was looking at the wrong dimension.\par
He had to pierce through.\par
Just the thought felt like a firework going off in his mind, setting fire to his nerve endings. A tingling rush spread through him; he gathered his Laws on his finger and simply poked. \par
It parted before his touch. Depth, not breadth. \par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Piercing\par
He grinned. Nice. \par
He stood, took a lap, walked outside, gave himself all of ten minutes to soak in the bliss of the achievement. \par
Then he sat back down and got to work. \par
There was one more Law to go, and again he could tell he wasn't going to get to it by thinking like he had about any of the others. It was different in kind.\par
He traced a few lines, a few pokes on the surface of the stone, but they all felt wrong. This Law… he had a feeling it wasn't so physical.   \par
Now he had almost all the pieces of the puzzle; it was much easier to identify the shape of the last chunk. \par
It was a matter of essence. What had the description said?\par
…this treasure allows the user to practice the Major Law of Sharpness across physical and essence surfaces, speeding Comprehension greatly.\par
'Essence surfaces'—that was it. His Sharpness had to be able to cut essence just as it cut physical things—slice through spells, shields, and strikes alike.\par
He squinted at the Whetstone. Then he tried poking around it, experimenting with it. It turned out he just had to channel essence through it for about half a minute—then it started glowing. \par
A second, ethereal Whetstone rose above the first, formed of pure essence.\par
Zane drew a finger through it. Nothing. It felt like touching a wall. He bounced right off. Then another, and another, but his Laws had no effect.\par
He was looking at it wrong. He closed his eyes. This time, he saw the Whetstone in the space of his mind. And he saw the shape of the cut he had to make. This time, as he reached out, he did so with the soul and the finger in tandem. When he cut, he cut two spaces at once.\par
And he felt it tear pleasantly under his fingertips.\par
Law Comprehended! \par
Minor Law of Ethereal Slicing \par
He let out a chuckle. \par
He had the full set. The Major Law of Sharpness was in his grasp. \par
When he went outside, he was shocked again at how much time had passed—it was well past midday of the next day. He barely felt he'd done anything. \par
Which meant he had just a handful of hours to snag that Major Law before he had to head back. \par
He threw himself at it with fervor. \par
For hours, he stared down at that Whetstone; for hours, he slashed and prodded, tried squeezing it altogether, juggling it every which way, pouring out the stuff of his soul until he was left gasping, lying there, soaked in his own sweat. \par
It wouldn't come. \par
Something about this major Law, the synthesis… it didn't feel like something he could grasp just sitting here.\par
The last time he grasped that Major Law, his mind had been like a crucible of emotion. A place of pure, intense hatred, in which all his Laws could fuse. He doubted he'd need something that strong this time. But still… \par
When he went outside once more, the sun was setting. Time had run out. \par
For this Law, he felt he needed another kind of whetstone. \par
He let out a long, shuddering breath. And smiled. He'd done his best.\par
It was time to for battle. \par
\par


\section{48. The Battle of Olympia Beach (I) }
\par
An hour before they left, Zane and Avery had a final training session.\par
It happened like this—\par
Reina had just briefed him on the plan. He stood there waiting for her to gather the rest of the army. Then Avery came out of nowhere and punched him on the shoulder.\par
"Yo yo yo.”\par
"Hello."\par
"I've been napping. What’ve you been up to?"\par
"Studying Laws."\par
"You make any progress?"\par
Zane shrugged. "I have two more than I did at the start of the day."\par
"You have what now?”\par
Zane repeated himself.\par
"Wait," said Avery, frowning. "So you have eight Laws?"\par
"That's right."\par
"What the fuck. That's how many I have!" She made a face. “Levels are one thing, but how are you getting Laws faster than me? Aren't you meant to be like... Rawrr..."\par
She did a flex, and he winced. "You said you wouldn't do that."\par
"... Sorry," she said, grinning sheepishly. "Well, guess what, buddy. I've got some new tricks up my sleeve too. Want to see ‘em? Fight me, you won't."\par
“…Sure."\par
***\par
Avery brought him out into the middle of a wide, empty field. They had to go quite a long ways to get out of the way of drilling troops.\par
When they did, Avery snapped her fingers. The world went black. They stood on nothing, an empty void swirled around them, dotted with stars.\par
"Looks like a pocket mirage, right?" said Avery. "Think again! This one's a field mirage—brand-spanking-new, Level III. I had to condense a Major Law of Light to get this bad boy. Turns out some Skill Levels have Law prerequisites. Who knew?"\par
"What's the difference?" said Zane.\par
"I can make them much bigger," she said. She snapped her fingers, and they stood in a desert. Pyramids popped up in the distance. Hot winds gusted over them, swirling with sand. He saw a sphinx, shaggy-maned, rippling with gold feathers, swoop overhead. It roared. "We could drop an army here, and all they'd see is desert.”\par
Zane blinked. "Neat."\par
"And you can't break out of this by hitting it either. Can't touch it directly. It's superimposed on reality," said Avery. "The only way to get out of it is by running out of its range. And I could set this bad boy to go for a square mile."\par
She puffed out a cheek. "Granted—I could probably only hold that for like… ten minutes? But still! Pretty cool, right?"\par
Zane nodded. "Mind if I try something?"\par
"Sure."\par
He got out an Axe and coated his new Law of Ethereal Slicing on the edge.\par
Then, carefully, he set it against the mirage. It was made of little modes of light essence so subtle, so small, there was no way you could catch it unless you were really looking for it, up close.\par
"Hey, I told you,” said Avery. “You can't break through it by just—"\par
Zane let the Axe loose. It drew a wide arc from sand dune to the sky. After it passed, it left a gaping crack. The rolling hills of the outside world poured in. Through the crack, you could hear Warriors drilling in the distance, the flick-flick-flicking of bow shots.\par
Avery stared at him. Her cheek twitched a little.\par
"Well," she said. "You weren't supposed to be able to break through it like that. What the fuck."\par
"It's my new Law," said Zane. "Ethereal Slicing. Cuts through essence." It was his first field test. He was pleased to see it worked.\par
Avery dropped the illusion, looking put out.\par
"You suck, you know that?"\par
"Thanks."\par
***\par
Reina called everyone back from all the nearby Safe Zones. She'd been rotating as many units as she could through Mount Saint Helens's essence geysers—she'd gotten a good chunk of them up to the 30s. Some were even in the 40s, including her.\par
Before they left, she came up to him. "How are you?"\par
"I'll get the job done," he told her. The plan Reina had pitched him was a good one. She had an eye for strategy.\par
But it all rested on him—it was built around him. If he screwed up at three or four separate points, they were done. Thousands were counting on him. Including her. It invigorated him.\par
"I know you will," she said, and she meant it—he could tell by the look on her face. He was always a little surprised how much faith she had in him. "You never let me down. I meant—how are you feeling?"\par
“Ready."\par
She nodded, letting out a tight breath. "Okay. Then... let's do this."\par
***\par
Before the hour was up the Highland Plains were spilling over with Warriors, just a sea of bobbing heads, mostly in the 20s and 30s, a few in the 40s. Thousands of people of dozens of sub-Factions.If you encounter this tale on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
And Reina and Zane stood at the head of them all.\par
Mostly, the faces he saw were determined, resolute. Some buzzed with either nervousness or excitement, he couldn’t tell. A few seemed straight-up frightened. Zane figured that was to be expected.\par
With as little time as she had, Reina had done a miracle with this ragtag army. There was no time to drill any sophisticated tactics into them. But they got most of the basics down, which was all you could ask for in three days.\par
Reina cleared her throat.\par
“Most of you had only just found your new homes when Marcus Blackwell drove you from them. So you marched here, to us. You came to us tired and bedraggled and lost. But here you found people willing to fight for you. To fight with you. People like you—people who weren’t ready to just lie down and take it. People who’d take the fight to the asshole who did this to you! Tonight is about revenge. Tonight's about showing that bastard he got a lot more than he bargained for when he messed with us. Let's give him hell!”\par
Short and to the point—very like Reina, but it still drew enthusiastic roars. An electric energy rolled over the army. They were raring to go. Zane cleared his throat. "Forward march!"\par
With the help of the Harbourmasters and a few scouts they'd set along the sides of Puget Sound, they had a pretty good estimate for where Marcus planned to land. It was the same place he landed Stroud's army when they first invaded. A strand of beaches near Olympia.\par
They marched for it.\par
***\par
Hours later, they arrived. And there they waited, standing on the sands, watching the moonlight rippling off the inky waters.\par
Zane stood there silently, watching the blank horizon, waiting…\par
And soon, he saw what he was looking for. Five spots of white drifting closer, growing quickly. One for each general left, plus the Soldier himself. Soon, they were huge, pale prows slicing out of the murk. It seemed impossible that ships so huge could glide so silently in the night.\par
They drew closer. Close enough to inspect.\par
Bone Galleon (C)\par
Crewed by ghosts from the Nether Kingdom, Bone Galleons are fearsome weapons of war. Their cannonballs, made of spectral energies, can bypass the physical and suck life-force from the soul. They turn invisible on nights with no moon.\par
The Bone Galleons could have been made only of the rib bones of some giant extinct dinosaur. Every inch of them was smooth, bleached white. White cannons hung out from their hulls.\par
And their giant decks were swarming with warriors, packed to the brim. Maybe they couldn’t fit all of Marcus’s army on board, but this had to be a huge chunk of his strength. There must’ve been thousands.\par
Soon, they were close enough for them to see the army waiting for them on shore. Shouts came up from the decks.\par
Zane calmly got out his Chains.\par
The cannons swiveled to face them, ghostly white light burning inside. They flared bright, aimed straight at where Zane and the bulk of his army stood, and blasted.\par
Zane threw.\par
Precision Slicing guided the arc. Ethereal Slicing let his Axes touch those ghostly blasts. And his Fire Laws brought the power.\par
A string of explosions rocked the air—dozens of feet from where they stood, clumps of red light shining over white. They faded, and the air was clear again.\par
Gasps burst out from the Galleons. Zane heard shouts of— “It’s him!”\par
“The Savage Sage!”\par
More shouting. Silver uniforms, hundreds of them, burst out onto the massive decks. Their weapons were at the ready. They seemed ready to leap over and charge them. They were bristling, just waiting to dock. Then, the sea of uniforms on the deck of the biggest of the Galleons—the Galleon closest to Zane—parted way.\par
A man at least two heads taller than all the rest, and twice as thick too, was fording his way through.\par
Flowing locks of blonde hair, a great shining white smile, and Zane could feel the intensity of his expression even from out here.\par
In his hands, he wielded a great sword that shone pure white, like a block of otherworldly marble. Its edge shone cruelly in the moonlight.\par
They locked eyes.\par
Marcus Blackwell (Creature)\par
Signature Title: Soldier of God\par
Essence Level: 77\par
Class: Divine Paladin\par
\par
Key Laws: \par
Major Law of Holy Cleansing (Elemental Law of the Sacred)\par
Minor Law of Fortification (Elemental Laws of Steel)\par
Minor Law of Tempering (Elemental Laws of Steel)\par
\par
Key Skills:\par
Wrath of the Heavens (Active) [Rare]: First draws immense power from the Heavens, charging the strike. Then unleashes that energy in a devastating slash, inflicting divine judgment on the Paladin’s enemies.\par
Blessed Guard (Passive) [Uncommon]: An aura of divine protection, granting great resistance to dark essence and physical damage. Allies near him receive a minor protective blessing.\par
Light of Redemption (Active) [Rare]: The greatsword pours out a holy light, healing allies and purifying negative effects within a certain radius.\par
Light of Purification (Active) [Uncommon]: The greatsword pours out a holy light, blinding and wounding enemies within a certain radius.\par
For the most part his weaknesses were like any man’s, except his broad chest lit up unusually red. Good to know.\par
Marcus seemed surprised to find him there. For all of a second. Then—\par
“Savage Sage. At long last!” He roared, grinning broadly. He thrust his sword straight out at Zane's head. “You’re MINE!”\par
The Galleons drew nearer. They were just a few hundred feet out from docking—\par
Phase one. Zane threw his Chains straight up, exactly as he’d done with the Mad Dogs.\par
A few cries went up—until they saw the Chains’ trajectories. He’d thrown them far too late. The Galleons were sailing too fast. They’d miss each other. Marcus laughed.\par
Then, almost all at once, a strained grinding sound flowed out from under them.\par
They teetered and bucked. A few dozen soldiers lurched overboard. Shocked cries filled the air.\par
The Galleons were thrown forward by their own momentum but they slowed fast. The grinding grew louder; sparks showered the air down by their hulls. It was like they weren't sailing on sea anymore.\par
Because they weren’t.\par
They lurched to shuddering halts. The men on board, the ones still on their feet, clutching to railings and ropes, looked baffled.\par
Then the illusion of a sea melted away, showing five Bone Galleons stranded on rocky stretches of beach.\par
Beside him, Avery gasped, pale-faced and sweating. But she still grinned. “Gotcha.”\par
There was a moment of panic. The fighters on deck looked up.\par
They had all of three seconds to get out of the way before his Chains, loaded with six Laws—one of them, an extremely explosive Major Law—touched down.\par
Skills shot up to intercept. The Soldier of God roared in defiance, and swept an immense line of light through the sky.\par
It connected with the Chains… and passed right through.\par
The illusion dropped to show the real Chains dropping in parallel, just a few feet away.\par
And by then it was too late.\par
Five enormous explosions rocked the world.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 68 -> 69\par
When the smoke cleared, five ships were split in two, listing on their sides. Burning. The survivors scrambled out like ants fleeing a flooded nest. He’d only taken out a good chunk of them—most still survived.\par
By sheer numbers they might still be ahead.\par
Most were still ready for war, especially the Lieutenants, who looked furious. Then they saw who waited on either side of them.\par
Rows upon rows of Warriors and Rogues and Healers.\par
And behind them were rows and rows and rows of Rangers, Bows notched tight. Just a second before, they'd been hidden under fake waves.\par
The Luminous Faction had the Galleons stranded. Surrounded.\par
Nobody had time to react before the first wave of arrows struck them. The Warriors rushed the Galleons, roaring battle cries; the Rogues followed, the Healers did too.\par
Zane had weakened them all he could. All around them, his fighters pincered the enemy. Avery dashed off to join them. He’d have to trust them to deal with the rest—he could only hope it'd be enough. He couldn't afford to think on it.\par
He had his own battle to fight.\par
One man rose above the mess—the Soldier of God had leapt on the prow of his broken ship, eyes red streaks and bulging. “ZANE WALKER!” He screamed. The veins on his neck stuck out purple.\par
And Zane made sure to twirl his Axes high above, flaming, shrieking in the air. A clear challenge.\par
Their eyes met.\par
The Soldier of God barreled toward him. And smiling, Zane ran to meet him.\par


\section{49. The Battle of Olympia Beach (II) }
\par
\par
Time for Zane to uphold his end of the bargain.\par
The Soldier of God was bigger than him, and higher Leveled than him, and a Major Law flowed off his huge shining sword, swelling its powers, making it hard to look at with the naked eye. \par
Here goes nothing….\par

Hours ago…\par
Reina sat Zane down to go over his battle plan. She'd interviewed Avery so thoroughly Avery got a little annoyed. She went over every Skill she'd seen Marcus use, every Law, exactly what his Soul Weapon was. \par
Zane would know that the instant he saw the man. But Reina insisted he had a well-thought-out plan beforehand. Zane was good at tactics, coming up with ways to win in the heat of the moment—what she gave him was strategy.\par
Marcus's main weapon was a Skill called Wrath of the Heavens. When he'd hit Avery with it, she'd caught it and fully redirected it—and it still nearly killed her. The only thing was, he had to charge it to unleash it.\par
"Here's what I think you should do," said Reina. And she went over her thoughts point by point. \par
After a while, he found himself just looking at her face. He could tell why people were drawn to her. It wasn't just her beauty, though that helped. It was her intensity, her focus, her insistence on doing everything the right way, down to the smallest detail. She'd had to work out the army’s whole strategy, and now she was here with him working out his fight too. She was remarkable.\par
She tucked a strand of hair behind her head and blinked up at him. "Zane?"\par
He blinked. “…Sorry. Could you repeat that?"\par
She smiled. "Of course."\par
*** \par
Now…\par
Marcus spat down at him. “That was a lowly trick, Sage! But if you think tricks are enough to beat me—” \par
He choked off. Zane was on him like a rabid dog. Reina's number one goal—don't let the man breathe. Don't let him charge that strike. Don't even let him find his footing. \par
So Zane threw himself at Marcus. He swung straight for the man’s throat.\par
He'd hardly gotten a step in range when Marcus's greatsword flashed into him, then out. Pain flared harsh down Zane’s left side, and a thick slab of flesh sloughed off. \par
Marcus's grin widened—and froze. Because Zane didn't slow at all. He didn't even wince—he'd run straight into the path of the blade. And kept on going. No chance to breathe. \par
Marcus tried dodging too late. Zane’s two swerving Axes sank deep into the man’s back. They ran up against a layer of divine essence and Ethereal Slicing cleaved through. White-hot blades met flesh. Fire worked beautifully with Sharpness, softened up the skin for the Axes to sink through and bite into the flesh beneath. \par
It felt like trying to shove a butter knife through iron.\par
What the Hell was this Marcus made of? It must be those Steel Minor Laws of his, firming his body. Still Marcus howled. He didn’t seem much hurt, just furious—like he couldn't believe he’d actually gotten hit.\par
He spun back, shrugging off the Axes. And Zane saw the black scar where he'd roasted the skin. Surface burns. Zane didn't let up for a second. His Axes were on short leashes today. One swing and they were right back at it, going straight for Marcus' head.\par
He slashed once. Marcus parried, stepped back, slashed again, and Marcus blocked it. But Zane just kept lunging, grinning—\par
Marcus slashed and took a chunk off of Zane's back. He must have carved off a chunk of lat—Suddenly, one of Zane’s arms felt odd to move.\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
He didn’t care. The next second, his slash ripped down the big man's chest. Blood and fire spurted into the air, and Marcus stumbled back. His face twisted in annoyance, like he was being chased by a very persistent wasp.\par
Zane slashed again, and again, and again. It didn’t matter if he got hurt. He just kept coming after the man. Marcus took a lump out of him, then another, but Zane just kept going, getting in his face, giving him no space—he could tell the man was getting uncomfortable, and Zane relished it. \par
Marcus was bigger. Marcus was stronger. The only thing Zane had on him was what Reina called ‘madman factor.’\par
“From what Avery tells me, he's used to fighting people scared of him. But you won't be. You're not scared of anything.”\par
He’d found it interesting how she took that for granted.\par
“Sometimes you fight like you’ve been possessed by a demon. I need that from you, Zane. Go to that place and don’t get out. Keep pressing him!” \par
Zane did. He opened up his heart and let it bleed out into the battlefield, and he took it straight to the man.\par
It was the only way he had a chance.\par
Sure he was getting butchered, but he had Marcus stumbling back. One wrong step and Zane got a clean cut all the way down Marcus’ thigh. He felt that cut in his soul—yes! He was getting closer. He tried pushing more for more, feeling that old fight fervor licking hot in his heart—\par
Marcus roared, "Enough!"\par
There was a blast of pure light, an eruption of blinding Major Law, and Zane was sent sprawling backwards. His whole front side felt scalded.\par
By the time he blinked the light out of his eyes, it was too late. Marcus’s sword flashed down. A chunk came out of Zane's leg.\par
“Ha!” Marcus roared.\par
He tried to press—it would’ve been so easy to fall back, then and there. Stolen from its rightful place, this narrative is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\par
But Zane stood his ground and threw with the man. Man-to-man. \par
He landed a blow, took another, threw a harder one back. The trouble was—\par
Warning: Health under 50\%!\par
Savage Body activated.\par
Vitaly increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Marcus couldn’t be much under 75\% health. Zane was losing.\par
But if Zane could do what he needed to do, none of this mattered.\par
He grinned viciously. His blood pumped hot and an electric thrill ran through his soul. He slashed another line down Marcus's chest, drew another fountain of blood even as one of his legs buckled beneath him. He gave out a hit, took one back, and slashed out another. He was having a hell of a time. \par
He was now this weird, lopsided, limping figure. Chunks were falling off his body by the second, but he didn't care. It didn't matter what Marcus threw at him. He refused to back down; he returned fire just as fiercely.\par
If anything, he was fiercer now. Savage Body gave him a second wind—it annoyed Marcus to no end. The man was seething shock and fury. It was like he had no limit to his anger—the longer Zane stood up to him, the angrier he got. His teeth were clenched tight, his eyes were wild red, and his face was flushed all the way through. He punctuated his hacks with screams. “WHY… WON'T… YOU…GO… DOWN?!” \par
Marcus leapt back, face twisted in frustration. Instantly Zane knew he was trying to charge Wrath of the Heavens—motes of light started collecting on his sword. But Zane was on him too fast, and he had to let go of it. \par
“Is this your idea of a fight, you stupid animal?!” Marcus roared.\par
Behind them, the Galleons were burning. Out of the corners of Zane’s eyes he saw the Luminous Faction swarming all over them. A few Lieutenants were holding their ground, but they were fighting dozens of men at once. The Iron Legion was slowly being pressed back, swallowed up—huge swathes of them couldn't even get off the ship; the arrows kept falling.\par
Meanwhile, Zane and Marcus went blow for blow for blow, carving massive chunks out of each other. One face was lit up with mad joy; one burned with rage. Marcus was bleeding all over, badly burned, smoking, charred up and down his body. \par
But Marcus was clearly winning.\par
Time was running out. Zane had done his best. He suppressed the man's best strike. He kept the man flustered, on the defensive. He’d poured out his heart. Reina had hoped it would be enough…\par
He stepped on a chunk of his own flesh, and nearly slipped. \par
It just wasn't enough.\par
If he kept going, there was a good chance he wasn't walking out of this one alive.\par
Warning: Health under 25\%!\par
But there was just one last hope. One last gamble. As a slash carved down his abdomen, Zane felt his life slipping away from him, felt death looming over his head, felt the beautiful pressure of it, and he smiled.\par
Reina wanted him to run if things got dire. Make an explosion, retreat to their ranks, and they’d cover for him… \par
But he was so close. \par
Fuck it. He had to go for it. He rolled the dice. \par
He gambled on the feeling—a feeling he'd been hunting the whole fight.\par
He bit down hard and stood his ground. He slashed, and blood flowed in a river down Marcus's chest. The big man howled and gored him right back.\par
Fuxi’s Whetstone wasn't enough. He needed something more testing to force out that crack in the Universe—another kind of whetstone. He felt his body failing on him. He felt his blood running white-hot. He croaked out a laugh. More, more, more! \par
SLASH-SLASH-SLASH-SLASH-SLASH—\par
It wasn't enough. Just a little more pressure—!\par
Neither man gave an inch.\par
But it was impossible to keep this up. They were both losing too much. One of them had to fall. \par
And it was Zane who fell first.\par
It was a matter of simple physics. His right leg simply ran out of tendons. So he fell to a knee. Marcus started to laugh, a sneering laugh of his own. He was bloodied. He was limping. But it was clear who was about to win. \par
Warning: Critical Health!\par
Savage Body activated\par
Vitality increased 50\%\par
Strength increased 50\%\par
Speed increased 50\%\par
Zane was so close—he slashed from his knees, defiant, and slashed again, managed to draw out the faintest hint of a crack. He saw it—so close!—\par
The greatsword went through Zane’s stomach and out of his back. Straight through his spine. He choked. \par
He blinked down at it, a little stunned. He tried to get up, tried to move, but it seemed his body wasn't listening to him, which was quite annoying. \par
“…” \par
He couldn’t feel much of anything. That was very, very bad news. \par
Seriously? \par
…Was this it?\par
He was in the middle of quite a good fight. It seemed a shame it should end here. \par
Marcus leered down at him. “How sad. I had high hopes for you, Savage Sage! But in the end, you were just another dumb mutt. Fitting. Fight like a mutt, and die like a mutt!” \par
He wrenched out his sword, and a fountain of blood went out of Zane’s mouth. He could see the crack in the Universe—it was so infuriatingly close. \par
Only…blackness encroached on his vision. The world was drifting away from him. He’d run out of time. He’d gambled… and it seemed he’d lost. \par
His head lolled, eyelids fluttering. He keeled over. \par
He had no regrets in his heart, at least. He’d put up a good fight. He’d fucked Marcus up pretty badly—well under 25\%. And Marcus’s army looked pretty decimated too. Reina, Avery, and the rest—Zane trusted they’d clean him up. Even if they couldn’t, his forces were crippled. They’d be safe, at least. That was enough. \par
“I’ve dreamed of this moment, you know,” said Marcus. He kicked Zane over, set a boot on his chest, and grinned down at him. “Do you know how angry you’ve made me, you little shit?”\par
He snorted. “If you thought I’d kill you this easily…” He barked a laugh. “No. You'll suffer just as you made me suffer! We’ll start with this little Faction you’ve scrounged together. What should I do to them? Any suggestions? A little flaying, a little—” \par
“No!” A cry. Zane saw Reina running over to him from the other side of the battlefield. Tears streamed down her face.\par
Marcus watched her come, amused. “Who’s this? Ah! This is Reina, isn’t it? Your second-in-command? She’s a pretty little thing, isn’t she? Ha! She’ll be Exhibit A. What do you think?”\par
“You bastard!” cried Reina.\par
She threw a Skill at Marcus, and he batted it aside contemptuously.\par
What the hell was she doing? Zane tried to tell her to get away, but his throat wouldn’t listen to him. He was in disbelief. She was usually so logical—yet when it came to him, somehow she totally lost her head. So much so she was charging the Leader of the Iron Legion. Alone.\par
Zane was struggling to get up to his feet in earnest, now. Struggling to do anything. But he could only watch as she threw herself at the man.\par
And he caught her by the throat with his sword hand. And all Zane knew was fear. \par
NO!\par
She thrashed. She choked. Marcus laughed and tightened his grip. Her flails were getting weaker, growing limp—\par
Zane opened his mouth and let out a soundless scream. There was a crack. \par
“Eh?”\par
Marcus blinked.\par
Where his sword hand had been, there now seemed to be a stump.\par
A stump burning with two Major Laws, woven through the head of a single Axe blade.\par
Then the pain seemed to hit all at once. Marcus stumbled back, howling, clutching at the stump.\par
Hovering in Zane’s blurry, dying vision, was one last notification. \par
Law comprehended! \par
Major Law of Absolute Sharpness\par
Reina dragged in a breath. \par
Then she thrust out her hands at Zane.\par
You have been afflicted by: Healing Touch III\par
Health restored 25\%!\par
The world rushed back to him. Suddenly his heart was beating again; he dragged in a breath. \par
And he stumbled to his feet. His whole body was trembling. Not from weakness.\par
From fury.\par
\par


\section{50. The Battle of Olympia Beach (III) }
\par
Zane went straight for the head. \par
Marcus was still staring at his stump of a hand in a daze. He only barely managed to prop up his sword. The Axes screeched against it, barely deflected. His sword was blasted into the ground. \par
Marcus stared dumbly at it. His expression slowly morphed from shock to horror.\par
His stump was one thing. But staring at that sword seemed to get through to him just how much danger he was in.\par
A huge smoking scar ran up the side of his Spirit Weapon.\par
That was not supposed to happen.\par
Marcus jerked back as Zane roared and threw again—and this time his Axes would not be denied. Marcus was quicker on the draw this time. But he could only duck one Axe. He had to brace for the other one. He crunched down, making a desperate guard with his forearms, and Laws of Steel poured over them, girding them—\par
Axe met flesh.\par
The Major Law of Absolute Sharpness ran up against those two flimsy Minor Laws of Steel and tore through them with contempt. It made the cut.\par
And the Major Law of Scorched Wrath powered the blade through.\par
Together Fire and Sharpness sliced clean. They passed through skin then muscle then bone then muscle then skin, coming out the other side, whistling free. \par
And one whole limb flopped to the ground. Blood spurted in a fountain.\par
Where there had been the stump of a hand, Marcus now had a new stump to stare at. His shaking stump of an arm. “Impossible!” he screamed.\par
Zane was not interested in what Marcus thought was possible. The only thing Zane was interested in was separating his head from his shoulders.\par
Marcus jerked up, met his eyes, and something he saw put the fear of God in him. His face trembled, he turned, started to run, crying out, and Zane would have gone after him but his legs buckled beneath him, still unsteady. He cursed.\par
Instead, he threw his Axes.\par
With his one whole hand, Marcus grabbed at his chest. \par
Then—"Stop him!” It was Avery, running over. “He's trying to get away! He’s—”\par
Marcus crushed something and threw it out. A portal materialized before him, leading to a gloomy hall. A single spot of light shone through the ceiling.\par
Zane’s heart lurched. No!\par
Marcus dashed through in an instant. The portal was fast closing behind him.\par
Zane urged his Axes faster. He tried sneaking them through—\par
The portal winked out. Marcus was gone.\par
Zane bellowed his outrage. “NO!”\par
He did not fucking accept this. He whirled on Avery. "Where did he go?!” he breathed.\par
Avery held up her hands. She looked shocked at the look on his face. "Whoa! Holy shit, dude. You're scaring me. It's over, he ran. We won!"\par
"This is not over until I say it's over," he snarled. There was so much rage in him he couldn't think straight.\par
Avery blinked. “Uh. Well, it went back to his Beacon, probably. That's an escape portal. It lets you open up a temporary portal back to home base in case you need to escape a dungeon or something... It's crazy expensive, though. Kind of like a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ thing…”\par
Zane’s head swam. So Marcus had gotten away? Just like that?!\par
Not if he had something to say about it.\par
Seattle, then. He looked across the waters, across all of Puget Sound, and imagined he could see its high spires looming there in the misty distance. His face twisted as he took a step—his legs gave out under him.\par
Suddenly, soft arms were all over him, under his arms, holding him up. It was Reina.\par
He snapped back to reality. Seeing her face felt like having ice water poured over him. \par
“Are you alright?” He rasped. \par
She nodded, smiling weakly. There were bruises on her neck. “A little sore,” she said. “But I’m fine. Look.” \par
She gestured over to the beach where their army was watching, gathered in ragged lines. The clothes were torn, patchy, and bloody, but big smiles graced their faces.\par
Where were the Iron Legion?\par
Then he realized—there were none left on the beach.\par
Avery’s words finally sank in.\par
They'd won.\par
*** \par
He couldn't stop them from mobbing him then and there. He couldn't even stop them from hoisting him on their shoulders and cheering as they marched all the way back to base. It was far from the first time he'd be mobbed that day.\par
Celebration lasted all through the day, all through the evening. By then, the main base was a wasted mess. Reina had banned certain items under the Beacon’s ‘Spirit Wines’ section during wartime. But tonight, she gave them free rein.\par
And the folks of the Luminous Faction made very good use of it.\par
Reina herself abstained, but Zane found Avery blacked out in a puddle around noon. \par
Around evening, Zane found Avery blacked out in an entirely different puddle. A few hundred meters from where he'd last seen her blacked out.\par
He tried staying out of the public eye, avoided the hotspots of the partying, but with his size, it was rather hard to be all that discreet. He lost count of the number of people who toasted him. They almost carried him on their shoulders again for a second round before he politely refused. He felt a little bad about being a killjoy, but he wasn't in a mood to celebrate. And parties had never been his thing anyway.\par
There was much dancing around campfires, and singing, and clinking of bottles, and feasting on racks upon racks of the Beacons' richest fowl and boar. Around the fringes, he saw older folks playing old card games—bridge and poker, but with a deck of treasure tarot cards serving in place of actual hearts, and pebbles for the chips.\par
Around early evening it all felt too stuffy for him. He excused himself and made for the far hills of the Highlands, a ways from camp. There he sat watching the flickering lights of the Faction, hearing the sounds of joy trickle over. Just thinking.The tale has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\par
Marcus Blackwell still lived. Every time he thought about how the man held Reina by her throat, the way she thrashed… this incredible hatred came over him. He wanted to break something.\par
And later, Reina herself came to visit. He wasn't sure how she found him, but she did.\par
“Can I join you?”\par
He shrugged. She sat down beside him, looking at him.\par
“You seem… tense. Not like you.”\par
It wasn't like him. In a way, she'd done this to him.\par
“We have to go north,” he said. “The work isn't done. We have to take back the Iron Legion's territories. And we have to take Seattle. I need to finish him off.”\par
They both knew who he was talking about. He found himself fantasizing about destroying the man in brutal detail—it disturbed him a little. He’d never felt bloodlust like this outside the heat of battle.\par
“We can do all that tomorrow,” said Reina softly. “Can't we rest today?”\par
She leaned her head against his chest.\par
“Reina—” he said hesitantly.\par
“I know,” she whispered.\par
For a while, they sat there in silence.\par
“Earlier today,” he said. “In the battle. You ran for me.”\par
He felt bad about bringing it up now of all times, but he couldn't stop thinking about it. It was stressing him out. “You can't do that, Reina.”\par
She was quiet. Then she said—"It worked out, didn't it?”\par
“It won't always.”\par
She looked up at him with her big, dark eyes. “Yes, it will,” she said simply, yet firmly, with such faith. “I know you. You'd never let me down.”\par
He opened his mouth, then just sighed.\par
He liked Reina. He liked her as much as he'd ever liked Sophie. Maybe more.\par
But this was a different world, and he couldn't give her what she wanted. He sensed she knew that. What he was made for, what he lived for, was to go out there. To grow stronger, to find greater mountains and to climb them, and find greater mountains still. To fight, not govern. \par
Already, Washington state was feeling too small for him. Soon, he'd be strong enough to solo clear its C-Rank dungeons. What then?\par
He was thinking about upgrading their Beacon even further, to C-rank too—then they could get national coverage in transmissions, and see all the way up and down the West Coast. They’d unlock rankings, new shop options, and a ton of other hidden features, of course, but it was the map that interested him most.\par
Expand the scope of the Beacon, and you'll see all the way down the West Coast. How many great dungeons lay along that trail? How many exhilarating fights were there to be had? Ever since he'd come back from Mount Saint Helens, when he wasn't totally focused on the war, an idea had been brewing in the back of his mind.\par
Seeing the West Coast. Adventuring—a road trip down to LA, where he heard there was an A-ranked dungeon and some of the strongest fighters in the country. There was a wasteland of strong dungeons and stronger Factions between here and there. Just thinking about exploring them got his heart beating faster.\par
Reina's place wasn't out there, though. Reina’s place was here.\par
He sensed she knew that already. They both understood, so neither of them had to say anything. They just sat there, her head on his chest, and quietly watched the night sky.\par
*** \par
Elias Vendor was humming as he walked up to the throne room of the Iron Legion. His humming was soon drowned out by the sounds of shattering, crashing, and, above it all, a deep-throated screaming. “Oh dear.”\par
He took a gander inside. Literally everything was broken. The great throne listed sideways, hacked in two. The panoramic glass windows were webbed with cracks. The ground was stuck through with craters, and Marcus had done a hack job on the walls too.\par
The man himself whirled around to face him. Gone was his perfect heroic façade. Instead, he seemed like a homeless man who'd stumbled across a stash of meth. And two stashes of steroids.\par
He caught sight of Elias, and one red eye bulged.\par
“You!” He roared.\par
“Hello,” said Elias brightly. “I hope now isn't too bad a time.”\par
He genuinely thought the man would run over and strangle him.\par
But Marcus made a good decision and heaved in a breath. “What do you want?”\par
Elias spread his hands. “You lost.”\par
Marcus's eye twitched. “Have you come to mock me, Warlock?!”\par
“I've come,” said Elias, smiling agreeably, “to offer you a deal. The Savage Sage is coming for you, you know. But with my help, you could show that upstart brat that you are still the true ruler of the Pacific Northwest. With my help, you could put him in the ground—for good!” \par
Marcus's eye twitched harder.\par
“And what makes you think I need your help?” He snarled.\par
Elias sighed. “Let's be frank, Marcus. Without me, you'd be lucky to live out the week as it is.”\par
It was too much for poor Marcus. Marcus lunged for his throat. \par
Marcus’s hand was about as big as his head. It might’ve some damage if it closed around his neck, like it was trying to. It never got there. \par
Their eyes met and Marcus froze. His whole body became one rigid block, and he fell over statue-still. \par
“Oh, my,” said Elias. “That was highly unprofessional.” \par
Pure hate shone in Marcus’s eyes. \par
“Hm,” said Elias. He knelt down by the man’s frozen body, fumbled through his bag, and took out a knife. A blunt knife. \par
“Look,” sighed Elias. “I’m not a violent person by nature. Violence is … crude. And so bad for business. I’d far prefer we all treated each other nicely and fairly! But then again… I can’t just overlook such blatant disrespect.” \par
He set the knife against Marcus’s wrist—the hand that’d reached for his throat—and slowly, methodically, humming as he went, he began to saw. \par
It took a while. Almost three minutes. Elias had no Laws of Sharpness, and he was not as strong as the Savage Sage. But that was kind of the point, wasn’t it? The cut was messy and jagged, nothing like the clean one Zane had made. It took a while to get past the bone. \par
By the end of it tears were streaming down Marcus’s cheeks. \par
“I know! And you just got the hand back.” Elias crouched down beside him. “Are you ready to behave?” \par
Marcus’s eyes trembled as he stared. “Good.” \par
Elias released the lock. Marcus lunged for his throat. “Oh, bother.” \par
He had to go through the whole thing again, but this time he cut it off at the elbow, and slower this time. He rubbed some alcohol on the knife before it went in, just to give it a little extra zing. Marcus was sobbing by the time he was through. \par
“How many limbs must I take off,” sighed Elias dramatically. “Before you respect me?” \par
Again he undid the lock, and waited. \par
The answer was one more, apparently. The foot, down at the ankle. That one took a while. \par
After he was done Marcus just sat there shivering. He’d lost his voice all of a sudden.\par
“Great,” said Elias cheerfully. “Glad we’re on the same page. So—my offer, then. Fairly similar to my last one…” \par
He tapped his Bag of Holding, and out poured the C-Grade Dragonscale set, shining blood-red in the weak light. Helm, breastplate, greaves, leggings, the whole thing. Close to priceless. \par
“Wear these,” said Elias. “And you’ll be untouchable. Those Major Laws Zane Walker’s got will bounce right off. You’ll handle him with ease. You’ll take back all that was yours!” \par
 Marcus couldn’t stop staring at them. He licked his lips, reached for them— \par
“Ah-ah!” said Elias, and Marcus flinched. “Not so fast. First, the terms… a twenty percent stake in all future essence earnings sounds fair to me. Oh—and it’s a loan, not a gift. If you lose, the set returns to me.” \par
Marcus looked ready to lunge at him again. “You! You go too far!” he choked. \par
“On the contrary.” Elias cocked his head. “Twenty is generous. I should ask for fifty percent. Hell, ninety percent.” \par
He was getting bored of this conversation. It was tiring being so polite to such a cretin. “You don’t understand, do you? You’re fucked. Zane Walker will come here in under a week’s time, and he will take your head off your shoulders. And there is nothing you can do to stop him! Except…” \par
He pulled out his black quill. “Sign on the dotted line.” \par
*** \par
Elias walked out, still humming, congratulating himself on yet another great deal struck. A 20\% stake in a future World Power! And he’d all but guaranteed the man his victory. The odds of winning should be something like over ninety percent now, by any rational logic. \par
Weird, though. Something about that Zane Walker… it made Elias unsure. He had a good feeling about the man. A similar feeling he got when he thought about Irina Magomedova, or Emeka Eze, or Jian Shi Ming—true world powers. It sent a thrill down his spine. \par
The new world had just begun. It was heaven for an investor. So much early potential! So much opportunity. And Zane Walker… \par
He was a strange one. Logic said he’d cap out somewhere around the Top 40s, Top 30s… gut feeling said much higher. \par
As an investor, when logic came in conflict with gut feeling, Elias found feeling won nine times out of ten. \par
Best to test, just to be sure. He glanced back at the Space Needle, where even now Marcus lay sobbing. \par
If Zane Walker could handle this final test, he’d know for sure.\par
Time to pay the man another visit. \par
\par


\section{51. The Finish (I) }
\par
The next morning, as most of the camp was still dozing, Zane saw a Signature's dot pop up on his mini-map.\par
It came in the same region as before. The dead forest, the lair of the Keeper.\par
Zane set out to meet it. And sure enough, there was Elias Ventor, hands folded, smiling a meaningless smile.\par
"Congratulations! For the second time this week, no less," Elias said. "Marvelous job on the beaches. You had me worried at the end there. But you pulled through. I did expect you to win, but I thought it'd be a team thing, not alone—you're just full of surprises, aren't you?" \par
"What do you want?" said Zane. He crossed his arms.\par
"Oh, just dropping by. I've heard some news," said Elias, shrugging. "Marcus is getting desperate. He's paid up big time to get this fancy set of armor from his allies up north. Impervious to your Laws, as it happens. I hear they're also sending serious reinforcements in... oh... three or four days? If you want to go after the man, your window's closing."\par
"I see," said Zane evenly. "And how do you know all this?"\par
"I have lots of friends," said Elias, waving a hand airily. "I hear things."\par
Zane stayed silent.\par
"I'd be worried if I were you," Elias continued. "I hear Marcus has decided to turtle up in the Space Needle and wait it out. And with his armor set, well... you'll have a hard time finding a way to get past all that in time…"\par
He touched a finger to his lips. "As it happens, though, I do have a little trinket you may find useful."\par
He shook out his Bag of Holding and pulled out a leather-bound book. A stylized blue flame logo marked the cover. The title was engraved in gold lettering of some language Zane had never seen before. It looked like something straight out of a museum—something that might've been in some ancient emperor's collection.\par
Rising Sun Slash, Vol I (C) \par
This Tome teaches the first Tier of the foundational Skill of the Azure Flame Faction, the undisputed ruler of the Weixing Cluster. For Azure Flame Faction disciples only. \par
Prerequisites: \par
1 Major Law of the Elemental Law of Wind\par
1 Major Law of the Elemental Law Fire\par
Since Sharpness counted as a Law of Wind, it was pretty much perfect for him. \par
"I picked this up in a C-ranked dungeon," said Elias, "Pity, though. No one in my Faction can make heads or tails of it. Seems to be some relic left by an alien Faction…Who knows? Maybe you can crack it. I should say, though—this one won't be easy. Just reading it takes a huge amount of Soul Power. I know another guy who meets the Law criteria—a World Ranker, mind you—and she couldn't figure it out either." \par
He tossed it to Zane, but Zane didn't catch it—he let it clatter on the ground. Elias shrugged. "Try it, or don't! It's all the same to me. If you can crack it, it'll solve all your problems, that's for sure. I'll come pick it up after the war's over. How's that sound?" \par
"Why are you giving me this?" said Zane. \par
Elias paused. "I think," he said slowly, "You may be someone special. But I need to make sure. Best of luck!"\par
He smiled, waved, and sauntered off.\par
Zane stood there, frowning, watching the man as he left.\par
'Allies in the north?'\par
The Harbour Masters had never mentioned any such allies. As far as Zane knew, the Legion only had enemies up there.\par
He got the feeling every second word out of Elias's mouth was a lie.\par
Frowning, Zane picked up the Tome and brushed it off. He checked it again. It seemed like a normal treasure, alright. It seemed as real as Elias' other gifts.\par
Strange. \par
If the man wanted to throw Zane free gifts, he was free to. Zane didn't mind taking free things. But if Elias imagined that earned him any goodwill with Zane or any control over him, the man had another thing coming.\par
***\par
By noon, the Luminous Faction had lined up to march once more. Through Reina's strategizing, they'd walloped the Legion army. They were all smiles. Morale was high. If anyone had doubts about Reina's leadership, they were gone now. \par
The Legion basically didn't have an army anymore. Only those who still clung to Seattle, a sad few hundred. Reina was more than up to the task of leading the Faction north and reclaiming lost land, Safe Zone by Safe Zone.\par
They were moving as fast as they could for Seattle. Zane checked his Beacon map at midday and found half the state lit up for the Luminous Faction. By evening, it was nearly three-quarters. They were converging on Seattle from all sides.\par
Apparently, Elias was telling the truth on another account—Reina soon confirmed Marcus had barricaded himself up in Legion headquarters. There, he seemed ready to make a last stand.\par
While his Faction went north, Zane stayed behind.\par
He sat cross-legged in an empty clearing and took out the Skill Tome. If Elias was telling the truth… he might need this. Couldn't hurt to check it out. \par
He opened it up and started to read. The pages were worn yellow, the text inked black in neat penmanship, seemingly by hand. It looked alien, but the letters somehow made sense in his mind. Like they were some universal language he knew but never learned.\par
It started with a lengthy treatise on the nature of Fire and Wind. How one fed into another—Wind sustained Fire, and on and on. Something about how devouring and slicing worked in the Universe... It was very flowery, very abstract. It kind of irked him. Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\par
Then the text got to the point: the Skill itself. At first, Zane couldn't grasp any of it. It just kept slipping out of his mind; he read sentence after sentence and couldn't tell you a thing about them. Something about these letters was odd, unlike any book he'd read before. It felt like they were trying to start a fire in his mind—but the verbal flint kept striking air. So nothing happened, over and over. \par
After he spent noon to dusk like this, just staring, he gave up on it. Every time he'd learned a Law or a Skill, he'd been quite emotional, at least excited. He was quickly realizing that he learned best when he was full of feeling.\par
The annoying thing was, he almost never felt that way on a daily basis. \par
He had to put himself in some other state of mind... he sighed. It was getting late.\par
He closed his eyes and thought about Marcus putting his hands on Reina. \par
He thought about the leering look on the man's face. He thought about the way Reina thrashed… The way Marcus laughed… \par
His chest was getting tight. He felt his teeth gnashing, his fists clenching.\par
This was it—yes. He thought about how dearly he wanted to slice that man into bloody ribbons. He let himself wallow in his hatred. It focused him.\par
He breathed out and gave the book another look. He read with a fiery intensity. He poured himself into the text.\par
This time, it took less than an hour to slip into it.\par
As he flipped through the pages, a scene surfaced in his mind, like a dream.\par
A short Asian man with steel-gray eyes locked eyes with him. He was dressed in something like those Japanese martial arts robes, wielding a sliver of a blade. \par
"Disciple of the Azure Flame Faction!" he said. "My name is Elder Cao. It is my honor to welcome you to the Martial Way." \par
He cleared his throat. "You are about to learn the first of the Azure Flame Faction's foundation Arts. Don't be fooled by its name—foundation is not basic. Foundation is essential! It is on the back of this Skill that the Founder first conquered the D-Grade Wulong Mountain World, and established this Faction. Of course—his Rising Sun Slash was Tier 14. Today, I shall teach you the first Tier." \par
Zane leaned in. Go on… \par
"But before that lesson," said Elder Cao. "You must learn the first lesson all martial artists must learn. Humility. On the road of Martial Arts you will fail over, and over, and over! You may have seen those Chosen, those Young Masters—true geniuses endowed with enormous Soul Power, who've achieved the First Tier of this Skill in mere weeks. It may be difficult to believe, but there are even certain natives of ur-Planets—that is, extremely rare planets with extremely high-potential natives—that learn this even faster! The Heavens do not distribute their gifts equally. Do not be discouraged, disciple, if it takes you months. Some take years. The Martial Way is long and full of bends… only the tenacious have a hope of reaching the end!" \par
All Zane got out of that was Elder Cao liked the sound of his own voice. \par
The man bowed to Zane. He drew his blade. At last. \par
Then he shouted, stepped forth, and slashed.\par
As the blade moved, Fire and Sharpness melded seamlessly together. You couldn't pick one apart from the other—they made one clean, immensely powerful slash. It glowed brilliantly, gloriously fiery, like the first rays of a morning sun. For a second Elder Cao glowed red—the world glowed red. Ripples of heat trailed in its wake. \par
It left a deep red scar burning in the air long after the short man sheathed his sword.\par
And bowed. And the scene vanished.\par
Zane blinked. \par
He had to see it again. He barely caught any of that. \par
For the next day straight, Zane played it back and forth, again and again. He didn't eat. He didn't sleep. He was lost in utter concentration. You couldn't prise the book out of his hands if you wanted to. And all throughout he let his hatred run at a slow boil. \par
Time slipped quickly by.\par
Around the end of his second day, he breathed out at last, closed his eyes, and shut the text. \par
He could see it in his mind's eye. Elder Cao raising his blade, and slashing. \par
Zane stood and summoned an Axe. He gathered Fire and Sharpness on its tip, just as the Elder had done. He ran them together like two streams merging to make one furious river, so seamless you couldn't tell the water of one stream from the other.\par
He took a step, threw out the Axe, and carved.\par
The world glowed fiery red. The heat of it buffeted his face. \par
Skill learned!\par
Rising Sun Slash I [Epic]\par
He looked up. Beside the crescent moon, there was a second brighter crescent of angry red, a tear on the surface of the world that lingered in the night sky.\par
So… it took him all of two days to grasp it. \par
It was a very powerful Skill, sure. Probably stronger than any he had right now. But he wondered what Elias had made all that fuss about. The man had made it seem like it'd be hard. So did that Elder Cao. Very strange. \par
What was that Elder Cao rambled on about? Humility? Zane had learned the Skill, sure. He didn’t feel any humbler. If anything he was baffled it was so easy. \par
He went back to base and saw where Reina had stationed her troops. By then, nearly all of Washington was under Luminous Faction control. They had Seattle surrounded.\par
The last message Reina sent him was from a Safe Zone near Bellevue. She said they'd secured the city, but Marcus had barricaded himself in the Space Needle beneath layers of walls teeming with tough Steel Laws. She said they had him surrounded, but they couldn't break through.\par
Zane made for Seattle. Strange. It had been two days, and he was still just as angry as before.\par
*** \par
Hours later, he arrived. \par
Seattle was a patchwork quilt of dungeons. Each neighborhood he wandered into had its own flavor; one, what had probably been the tech sector, had looming dungeons of glass and steel—other areas downtown had an old-world charm, dominated by vines and huge stone buildings. He passed where the University of Washington had been, now an E-ranked dungeon called 'Labyrinth of Lost Knowledge.' Its buildings were made dark, gothic, haunting, all jagged spires, snaking with mists. \par
Most of the city was smoking. The faces of skyscrapers were blackened and craters dotted the streets. The signs of battle were everywhere—but it was over now. The Needle—where Marcus made his headquarters—stood out high above the rest. Zane marched for it. \par
Zane had been to the Needle once before as a child. It still looked like itself—only more so, all space-gray and sleek and domineering. \par
Walls surrounding what had been the Space Needle were high, lined with barbed wire, and gleamed with runes—runes that threw back anyone who tried to enter and melted any strike that went against them. Thick Steel Laws shimmered on the walls. Zane watched as hundreds of Rangers shot straight into them. On the other side, warriors hacked ferociously. None could so much as scratch it.\par
As Zane passed through, his army squawked and scattered, clearing a path.\par
He drew out his Axes.\par
"Stand back," he said calmly. \par
His Axes lit up with Fire, lit up with Sharpness. \par
Rising Sun Slash! \par
His Axes shot forth. The world flared red. There was a great piercing screeching. \par
When the light cleared there was a smoking V, glowing deep black-red, carved down the front of the wall. \par
Zane yanked. \par
And that whole chunk of wall came flying. Not falling over—flying. It sailed overhead, vanished into the distance. Somewhere far behind, there was a thick splash. \par
“Stay out of my way,” Zane said to his army. “That man is mine.” \par
And he marched on through. \par
\par


\section{52. The Finish (II) }
\par
Marcus used to love his throne room. It was grand and vast, and when you walked about, you could hear your footsteps echoing front to back. When he let out his booming laugh, the whole room shook with the sound of it.\par
Now he hated it. Try as he might, he couldn't stop the sounds from leaking in. The screams, the screeching of steel on steel—and worst of all, that growling, roaring, raging fire. Pouring up the great staircase, up to where he stood waiting. He was clad in his full dragon skill set, teeth clenched, greatsword thrust out before him like a rosary. Like he was praying. \par
Zane Walker was just a dog, he reminded himself, just a Mad Dog. Frothing and full of teeth, but Marcus would put him down.\par
…Somehow he couldn't quite make himself believe it. He kept thinking about the look in Zane's eyes as he rose from the dead. He kept breaking out in cold sweats. And Marcus was not an easily scared man—not by far. He'd been first through the breach of countless daunting Dungeons. He'd faced Monsters with ten Levels on him head-on! \par
And yet… \par
"Come on… come on…" Marcus ground out. He was sweating, trembling. His eyes trained squarely on the door. The burning drew closer, and closer still...\par
Then it all went quiet.\par
So that was the last of Marcus's men, then. \par
It was just him left. Trapped in this tower, alone. And it was coming for him. \par
The only sound was a single pair of footsteps climbing closer and closer. And Marcus could nearly hear the anger in them as they came. \par
"Come on!"\par
Motes of light gathered down Marcus' greatsword as Wrath of the Heavens began to charge. Light streamed in, picking up speed, until a thick vortex of it swarmed the metal, making it glow white-hot. The steel was suddenly bursting with the essence of the divine. It was blinding to look at.\par
Thud… thud… thud… The sounds of his heartbeats were mixing unpleasantly with the sounds of the footsteps.\par
Soon his single most powerful blow charged to its fullest. And he held it there, arms trembling trying to keep it straight. There was so much essence he could hardly control it, could hardly hold on. If it blew now, it might take off his upper body. Sweat poured down his face. He had to keep it steady, had to aim it just right! \par
He knew he had just one shot. \par
Luckily, it was a shot that had taken down C-rank Dungeon Bosses in just one blow. He hadn't met a single creature who could withstand it—much less block it. Even if Zane somehow survived this… he'd be done. \par
Marcus just had to land it. \par
Thud… thud… thud.\par
The sound stopped right outside his Great Hall.\par
A silence.\par
Then the doors were blasted open with a bang, and Zane Walker strode in.\par
And on his face was that exact same expression—the same one Marcus had seen in his dreams. Marcus nearly lost it then—nearly.\par
"DIE!" He shrieked. He slashed with everything he had, with animal desperation.\par
The strike was so bright it blinded even himself. A colossal force swept the Great Hall, a moving sea of essence, and he felt it crash—felt it strike.\par
He blinked. No… he couldn't believe it. He'd gotten it off! \par
"HAHA!" He laughed, exhilarated. "Fuck you, Zane Walker!"\par
Then he blinked away the light, blinked the spots out of his eyes—and choked.\par
A nearly red-black scar hung burning in the air, motionless.\par
And the man behind it was untouched. Not a scratch on him.\par
Marcus felt all his joy drain to the soles of his feet. "No," he whispered. "NO!"\par
They locked eyes, and Marcus flinched. Cold, dead eyes, like the eyes of a machine—yet his face was twisted in fury. Zane strode toward him, Axes swerving around, and Marcus nearly ran. But where to? There was no running from this. This man was Death. \par
Marcus shook his head. He was bigger, he was stronger, and he wore some of the finest armor anywhere on Earth. He should be the confident one! \par
Yet, when he looked in Zane's eyes… why did he feel so scared? Why did his knees start to tremble? Something in that man's face…\par
"Wait," he babbled, propping up his sword, holding it between them. Those ten feet of massive spirit weapon suddenly felt flimsy as a toy. "Wait, wait, wait!"\par
Then the Axes came for him, and he screamed.\par
He thrust his sword at one, barely deflected it. The force nearly ripped his weapon from his fingers.\par
The other Axe struck him clean.If you come across this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
A red streak ripped open the world. It sank deep into his armor—and it passed through, a hot knife through butter. The muscle, the bone, the tendons underneath, all reinforced by Minor Laws of Steel—it might as well be air.\par
Marcus couldn't even process it. He just stared at that red scar in shock—and his smoking stump of a leg. This was real C-grade armor. He'd tested it with his own blade—he'd slashed with all his might and he couldn't so much as dent it!\par
Then the pain struck, and he couldn't think anymore. A pain that lanced so intensely he choked out a sob.\par
When the next Axe came, he barely managed to throw up a parry. The Axe blasted it right out of his fingers and sliced off another leg.\par
Then he was on the ground, eyes streaming. The pain was so intense he couldn't put a thought together. Where was his blade? He had to get his blade—he couldn't go out like this! He was Marcus Blackwell! The Soldier of God! He had a miracle in him—he must! He saw his sword through a blur of tears. Its top half had been sliced clean off; it looked more like a butcher's knife now. He didn't understand. This was all some mad nightmare, it had to be.\par
He reached for it—and an Axe went right through the arm. And the last of his hope vanished.\par
He could only watch, bleary-eyed, as that Monster in human flesh stood above him, staring down at him. The Monster planted a foot on his chest, stared deep into his eyes, and Marcus saw it. Why he'd been so scared this whole time.\par
This was no man. You could see it in his eyes—it was a look more monstrous than he'd seen on any Monster. It made so much sense. Look deep in Zane Walker's eyes and you saw a ruthless machine, a machine running on pure hatred. Marcus was certain off it. This man had no soul. \par
"Monster!" Marcus shrieked. "MONST—"\par
Then he couldn't speak anymore. Zane fed him his Axe.\par
Zane did it slowly, bit by bit, and all the while he stared dead in Marcus's eyes. The last thing Marcus felt was pain beyond the world. The last thing he saw were those cold gray eyes.\par
*** \par
Zane looked Marcus dead in the eyes. Zane wanted to see the exact moment the light went out of them.\par
And he did. Marcus' head lolled back; the pale blue eyes lost focus. \par
Then the Axe cut all the way through, and the head split in two. And that was that.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 69 -> 70\par
That was easy. Far too easy. Most of the time, easy fights were not satisfying to him, but this… \par
This was a delicious exception.\par
Zane looked up, closed his eyes, and basked in the feeling. He wished he could bring the man back to life just to kill him again and again and again. What that man had done to Reina… he was still shaking with fury. \par
But it was ebbing. Slowly.\par
For the first time in days, he felt like he could breathe again.\par
It was over. \par
He'd won. \par
*** \par
After the Battle of the Beaches, the mood of the Luminous Faction was shocked joy—they hadn't really thought they could win against the legion. Then Reina and Zane showed them what was possible.\par
Now, the mood was just relief. They'd all seen this coming—as they took dungeon after dungeon, as they closed in on Seattle, they could all sense the end. And at last, they were here.\par
As Zane climbed down the last of the steps and stepped out into the open, all he saw on his soldiers' faces was relief. Their bodies, knotted with stress for days, weeks on end, could finally relax. They were so, so glad it was over.\par
To Zane's relief—and it was absurd to be relieved about this, but he was—no one seemed in any mood to throw up a parade, at least not yet. No more huge bashes. For now, they seemed content to bask in the victory.\par
As Zane walked out onto the streets, he saw the frightened citizens of Seattle coming out of the skyscrapers in clumps. They came in all sorts, young and old, some in families—by the looks on their faces, you'd think they hadn't seen daylight in weeks. They were whispering amongst each other, wide-eyed, and they cried out when they saw him walking.\par
"Is that madman dead?" croaked a disheveled woman.\par
He nodded. "Yes. You're safe now." \par
The relief on their faces was palpable. Some dropped to their knees, sobbing then and there. There must have been thousands poking their heads out of the buildings, looking over at him. Their faces lit up as they saw him. It was over for them too.\par
"Zane!" cried a voice. He turned—it was Reina, dashing toward him. She leaped at him and caught him in a deep hug, burying her face in his chest. "We've won!"\par
She stayed there for a long while. Chuckles and cheers went up from Faction members all around them.\par
Some were staring outright. To them, it must have been a rare show of emotion from her—and not just because they knew her as their type-A leader most of the time, all business. For a while, she'd been averse to showing her affection for him in public. She'd told him as much. She didn't want people to think she'd gotten where she was not because of her skills, but because they had some special relationship. And her worries were founded—before her victory on the beach, Zane had overheard a few Rangers speculating just what kinds of favors she did for him to get her position. It took some effort not to beat them down on the spot.\par
Right now, Reina was beyond caring. As she nuzzled her head in his chest, smiling softly, she seemed in bliss.\par
After a while, she stepped back and swallowed. She seemed to realize where she was—she got all flushed. "I… I should go tend to the cleanup." Then, like some last-ditch attempt to save her reputation—"…excellent work, soldier."\par
She strode off, face red, head held high. Avery came up soon after, blowing bubble-gum. Yet another thing Zane was sure the Beacon shop did not sell.\par
"Goddamn," said Avery, whistling. "She's so down bad she's almost underground. Anyway. Nice job!" She threw him a thumbs-up and a crooked grin. "Fuck that guy. Good riddance. Oooh—have you claimed that Beacon of his? The C-ranked shop has sushi! It's been ages since I had sushi."\par
***\par
It turned out the Beacon was right next to the Space Needle. It was in the same courtyard. A fat golden pillar stood twenty or thirty feet tall, inscribed with glowing white runes. \par
Would you like to claim Safe Zone: Interstellar Bastion (C)? \par
Zane accepted. \par
When he interfaced with it again, it felt like upgrading from a laptop from the 90's to something modern—there were so many new features it was hard to count. Avery got her sushi first, but there were a breadth of other treasures, up until C-grade. There were higher leveled training arenas. There were made-to-build buildings you could customize and buy and plop down, like a Sims game. There were options to rehabilitate certain areas of the Safe Zone—if he upgraded the Luminous Faction's beacon to C-rank, he could revitalize the dead forest with one payment. \par
But that was just the start. Right next to it was a new section—World Ranking. He clicked on it, and found he was number 48. It seemed ranked by Level. \par
The Top 10 appeared before him: \par
1. Irina Volkova (S)\par
2. D'Angelo Hall (S)\par
3. Emeka Eze (S)\par
4. Jian Shi Ming (S)\par
5. Jago Land (S)\par
6. Yui Urabe (S)\par
7. Cristina Dos Santos (S)\par
8. Cain Hastings (S)\par
9. Dulce Ramos (S)\par
But number ten was what caught Zane's attention. \par
\par
 Jason Walker (S) \par
\par
\par


\section{53. The New Deal}
\par
Jason Walker?\par
It couldn't be the same Jason Walker. Right? But in Zane's gut, he knew.\par
It had to be. This was Zane's brother he was talking about. It would've been more shocking if he were not elite.\par
The last Zane had heard of him, he'd graduated top of his class at Harvard and was working at some executive level somewhere important—the World Bank, or the president's cabinet, or something. Zane had lost track. He'd tried not to know. He wasn't even sure if Jason was still in America.\par
Jason was the type of man you could throw on an island infested with cannibals, and when you returned a year later, you'd find they'd made him king. He had a strange idea of love. He'd throw you into shark-infested waters to teach you how to swim—and if you died, that was on you. You weren't strong enough. You didn't deserve to be Jason Walker's brother.\par
When Jason had shoved him over the railing at Yellowstone, and Mom berated him afterward, Jason claimed it was Zane's stupid fault. Maybe he shouldn't have stuck his head over the railing so far, like an idiot. Jason was teaching him a lesson.\par
When Brad made fun of Zane's parents' death, Zane had tackled him through a wall.\par
That same week, an upperclassman, jealous his girlfriend had a crush on Jason, had made a dig too.\par
Jason put him in the hospital. The man couldn't eat solid food for six months straight.\par
If Zane saw Jason… he wondered if, somewhere out there, his brother could see him too.\par
***\par
Zane moved past the rankings to the next tab. This one was a progress bar—it showed:\par
Integration Phase: 0\par
World Dungeon Clear Percentage: 38\%\par
So, about a third of the world's dungeons were cleared. Seemed about right. It looked like a progress bar—like once they hit 100\%, they'd go to the next Integration Phase. Zane wondered what it meant.\par
So far the aliens—or whoever threw this System on them—were awfully quiet. Earth's people only got hints of their existence through Treasures. Like that Azure Flame Faction tome. What were they waiting for?\par
Zane checked out the next tab. This one was marked 'Quest Board.' It showed a map similar to the Dungeon/Safe Zone map, except it had little 'Q' markings all over the place. When he checked one of them down the West Coast, he found—\par
Quest: Rescue Mission\par
Issuer: Charles White, Leader, Mighty Sequoia Faction—\par
"Calling all top-100 World Rankers! One of our Safe Zones has devolved into a B-ranked Dungeon. Some of our best fighting men are trapped inside, fending for their lives! Time is of the essence! We need you to clear the Dungeon and rescue them."\par
Reward: B-grade Essence Treasure\par
This was pretty cool. You could put out a System-mandated call to pretty much the whole country, and see who'd answer. The System even let Zane make quests of his own—only it warned him that there would be a severe penalty if he failed to produce the reward.\par
Some quests offered hundreds of high-grade essence stones for clearing certain A-rank dungeons. He imagined only a team of World Rankers could take those up.\par
Worth looking at as he went down his road trip, he figured.\par
Which brought him to the world map, expanded now. He could see a vast chunk of the West Coast—down past San Diego and up to nearly Alaska. And east, too, so far he could make out some Dungeons on the edges of what used to be Texas.\par
He focused on where he was, and went down. His imagination went wild seeing all those high-ranked Dungeons—you could string them up on a route. There was the C-ranked Abyssal Crater Dungeon in Oregon, about where Crater Lake National Park used to be. The Gorge of Elemental Winds, which looked to be the Columbia River Gorge transformed. The Titan Wood Forest Dungeon, where the redwoods were. The Bridge of Fate near San Francisco, a B-ranked dungeon that even Elias's Faction hadn't cleared. That had to be the Golden Gate. They just went on and on…\par
Elias made it sound like C-ranked Dungeons were overflowing with rare Treasures. Zane would soon see. And what did B-ranked dungeons look like?\par
A lot of them had quests attached. He had a feeling he wouldn't be the only one trying to clear them.\par
***\par
After the war came rebuilding. Reina had to integrate all their new territory. She had her work cut out for her.\par
First, she gathered representatives from every Safe Zone in the state in Seattle. She formed councils, one for the northern half of the state, one for the southern half. They'd report directly to her.\par
In the meeting, she made sure to have Zane sit directly at her left-hand side, glowering. So everyone seemed pretty happy with the arrangement.\par
She got to making maps of all the Treasure Areas and Safe Zones under Luminous Faction control. She marked regions that needed development. She drew up plans for what to do in case a Safe Zone devolved. She made keeping militias mandatory for each Safe Zone. She put into motion standardized training programs for each Class.If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
She made plans for a diplomatic corps made of folk she trusted. Almost as soon as they won, messages started pouring in from Factions all over the West Coast. There were trade offers to be negotiated, alliances, non-aggression pacts…\par
Then there were her plans for infrastructure—making roads between each Safe Zone, making sure each Safe Zone was livable, with ample training resources. And on and on…\par
Most of it flew over Zane's head.\par
It took Reina nearly a week of back-to-back sleepless nights before she got most of her plans underway. To Zane she was pretty much superhuman.\par
***\par
Around the end of the week, Elias paid them another visit. Just as they'd expected. This time, Zane, Avery, and Reina were all waiting for him as he sauntered up the dead forest.\par
"Zane Walker! You just keep exceeding my expectations, don't you?" said Elias. "You've really outdone yourself this time. Oh, my."\par
"Elias Ventor," said Reina coolly. "I've heard a lot about you."\par
"You must be Reina Torres! It's an honor."\par
"You were the one who gave Marcus that suit of armor, weren't you?"\par
Elias blinked, then chuckled. "Straight to the point, eh? Wow. That's quite an accusation. What makes you say that, Miss Torres?"\par
"Who else could have given it to him?" Reina shrugged. "You told Zane some 'northern allies' had done it. Northern allies whose reinforcements, by the way, failed to materialize. Almost as though they never existed at all."\par
Elias paused. "That's an interesting theory. Now, why would I do that?"\par
"Because this was all an elaborate test," said Reina. "You wanted to see what Zane was capable of. So you played us off each other. For your amusement."\par
There was a long silence.\par
Then Elias laughed.\par
"Clever girl. You got me. Guilty as charged! Honestly? I'm just here to make essence. So I gathered data on an investment. And what of it? You can't be that mad, surely." That last bit he directed to Zane.\par
"I gave you so much stuff! For free! A Major Law and C-ranked Skill! Well done mastering it, by the way."\par
"I don't appreciate your games," said Zane calmly. "If you continue to insist on playing them, we'll have a problem."\par
"Fair enough," Elias held up his hands. "I'm done! I've seen all I needed to see. And I've made my judgment. If I may—I feel like it's the 80's, and I just stumbled upon two hippies working on a little old thing called the Macintosh."\par
“…”\par
"What I'm trying to say," said Elias, smiling, "Is I have a lot of shit. I'm really, really rich, Zane. And right now, I really want to give some of that shit to you."\par
"'Give'?"\par
"Well… in exchange for a small stake in your future essence earnings, of course. You understand."\par
"No."\par
"Just hear me out," said Elias quickly. "If you thought that Whetstone and that Skill tome were cool—"\par
"No."\par
Elias's grin turned helpless. He wrung his hands. "Come on—there has to be some kind of deal we can come to? Do you want me to beg? I'll do it! Look, just keep an open mind, alright? This doesn't have to be a zero-sum game. We both have so much to gain!"\par
"I believe that," said Reina, and she stepped forward. "I believe there's a way you can help Zane, and yourself. I also believe whatever contract you offer would never do that. You'd try to screw us every chance you get."\par
Elias sighed. "You wound me."\par
She tapped her bag of holding and pulled out a Treasure. A golden headband that curled up at the ends.\par
Wukong's Crown (C)\par
Wukong's Crown is a teller of truth. If the wearer of this treasure tells a lie, the Crown will shine brightly and inflict great pain on them.\par
A few nights before, Reina had cataloged every one of the hundreds of items in the Beacon shop. When she came across this one, she'd immediately drawn up a plan in case Elias came again. It cost a small fortune… but if this worked out, Reina said it'd be worth it.\par
At the sight of it, Elias twitched a little. "Oh, come on," he said. There was that oily little grin again. "Must we resort to such... unsavory... tactics?"\par
"You will negotiate with this on," said Reina firmly. "And you will negotiate with me. I will ask you every little detail about whatever contract you draw up. And if it's not to my satisfaction, no deal either. Got it?"\par
Elias opened his mouth—\par
"This is the only condition under which I will negotiate with you," said Reina. "Whatever else you have to say, you can shut it."\par
The twitch on Elias's face turned into a spasm. He glowered. "Clever girl," he whispered. He thought about it for a few seconds. Then—"Fine, then. Have it your way!"\par
***\par
The negotiations went on for nearly an hour. It was interesting to watch Reina work—she asked him to define nearly every word in his contract, to his exasperation—catching him in the act several times. She'd constantly ask him about his intentions, about whether he inserted words that could offer the faintest possibility of future loopholes. When he presented terms she shoved so hard Zane thought he would leave then and there.\par
All the while, she kept peppering him with questions like—\par
“If you were Zane, would you take this contract?” “If you were advising someone you cared about, would you accept the contract in its current form?” “Are there any non-obvious hidden costs?” and even— “How much more would you be willing to offer to get Zane to sign? What’s your absolute limit?”\par
That last one had Elias cringing so hard he seemed in genuine pain.\par
When she asked him, “What do you project as Zane’s ceiling in a year?” He said instantly, “Top-3 World Ranker. No question.” And to the question, “What do you project as Zane’s floor in a year?” He said, “Top-30 World Ranker.”\par
More than a few times she caught him sneaking in a lie. A loophole that would've trapped him in eternal servitude, or a trick of language that gave him far more control than he made it seem. The Crown worked wonderfully each time. Elias was sent rolling around, howling. He always came back up with a 'who me?' expression.\par
At last, Reina brought Zane a deal she thought was fair. Elias was sweating by the end of it. He looked like he'd just been through a twelve-round boxing match.\par
"Christ!" said Elias. "Your girl's a goddamn bloodhound. You should feel lucky. That's the only fair deal I've given out in the past decade." He had Wukong's Crown on as he said it.\par
The terms were as follows:\par
A 1.5\% non-controlling stake in Zane Walker's future essence earnings, good for 4 years.\par
After 4 years, optional continuation if both sides find the agreement satisfactory.\par
As part of terms, initial offering:\par
1 B-grade essence treasure\par
1 B-grade Skill treasure\par
1 B-grade Law treasure\par
10 high-grade essence stones\par
Afterwards—\par
Elias Ventor will bequeath Zane Walker, every other month:\par
2 B-grade treasures\par
10 high-grade essence stones\par
Stretch term 1: If Zane Walker surpasses Essence Level 100, this goes up to 3 B-Grade treasures and 25 high-grade essence stones.\par
Stretch term 2: If Zane Walker surpasses Essence Level 125, this goes up to 5 B-Grade treasures and 50 high-grade essence stones, or 2 A-grade treasure and 50 high-grade essence stones.\par
Additionally: Zane Walker must find all treasure gifts satisfactory. If not, Elias Ventor must offer alternative treasures until such time Zane Walker finds one satisfactory.\par
Additionally: The Luminous Faction and the Silicon Coven will maintain a non-aggression pact for the duration of this contract. The Silicon Coven will offer Zane Walker unrestricted access to all its highest-quality resources, such as training grounds or Treasure Areas.\par
Additionally: Buyback clause: Zane Walker may void the terms of the contract by turning in 3 A-grade treasures. Buyback may only be executed after 2 years have elapsed. \par
“So,” said Elias. His smile was frazzled. “What do you say?”\par


\section{54. Spirit Steel (I) }
\par
Zane read it over a few times.\par
Giving up 1.5\% of his essence earnings… wasn’t a lot. Especially in exchange for a huge boost up-front. The best treasures Zane had gotten were only C-grade—what would B-grade treasures do for him? And three of them at once?\par
He’d started in the middle of nowhere, stranded in E- F- rank wilderness— Elias was right on that. He'd have to be the best to fight the best. He could do with some catching up…\par
Still he hesitated. \par
“What?” said Elias, baffled. “You want more? You don't understand how good these terms are! I've only agreed to this much because I have a… Well, a frankly irrational belief in what you can be. I'm giving up too much, honestly!”\par
It wasn't the amount that made Zane hesitate. He wasn't pleased it was Elias making the offer. He still didn't like the man—but Reina wrung out this deal. There was nothing hidden in it, nothing off.\par
He still didn't trust the man any. Elias was slimy as they came. But Reina had pinned him down, and he trusted Reina. This was as good as it could ever get.\par
“I want nothing to do with you,” Zane told him. “We are not friends.”\par
Elias didn't look offended in the slightest. “Sure, sure. Just business, then. Do we have a deal?”\par
He held out a hand.\par
Zane shook it.\par
He handed Zane a black quill, and the status box popped up with all the terms. Zane signed it, and it vanished.\par
Soul Contract formed!\par
“Man,” sighed Elias. “This is a first. I’ve never had to beg someone to take a great deal. Three B-grade treasures… those don’t grow on trees, you know! That’s a tenth of my stash!” \par
Zane felt nothing change in him. He guessed the System took care of his end of the bargain.\par
“Right then! Your first gifts,” said Elias. “Any preferences? I'm all ears. Let's start with the Law treasure, shall we? Fire? Wind? Earth?”\par
Zane thought about it. If he went Fire, he could get closer to making his Elemental Law… but fire seemed mostly offensive. And he had enough offense. The gaping hole in his powers was defense. \par
“Something defensive.”\par
“Then you'll want Steel,” said Elias instantly. “Real steel. Marcus barely scratched the surface of what those Laws are capable of. They're strong as hell, crazy hard to break—Bjorn Gustafsson, World Rank \#13? That’s his primary Law.”\par
Zane could believe it. Before he stacked two Major Laws, he could barely put a scratch on Marcus—and Marcus had only had a few Minor Laws of Steel.\par
Recording Crystal: Sermon on the Elemental Law of Iron (B) \par
This Recording Crystal captures a sermon on the Elemental Law of Iron given by the Sage of the Iron Fist, circa 13th mega-annum A.S. For use by disciples of the Steelheart Conclave or associated sub-Factions only. \par
“Here,” said Elias. He handed Zane a crystal. “Use this well. It’s my only B-grade Steel Law Treasure.” \par
 \par
He glanced at it fondly. “It’s probably got… ten or eleven viewings left, before it crumbles? Who knows? Maybe you can squeeze a Major Law or two out of it.” \par
Then, a pure black metal bead. Zane was a strong person. \par
Steel Bead (B)\par
Upon swallowing, this treasure grants the skill:\par
Spirit Steel Body (Passive) [Epic]\par
Gives the body the durability and density of Spirit Steel. Extremely resistant to both slashing and concussive damage. Steel grade scales with level.\par
Prerequisite: 2 Major Laws of the Elemental Laws of Steel\par
(Prerequisites fulfilled: 1/2) \par
Zane had no such Laws as far as he was aware… unless Absolute Sharpness counted? It must, it was the only thing that made sense. \par
"The treasures pair together," said Elias. "First finish off the crystal, then take the bead."\par
Reina inspected them. She seemed surprised. “They're actually… good.” Privately, Zane agreed.\par
"Of course, they're good," said Elias, rolling his eyes. “I’m invested in you now. I want to see you succeed! Selfishly! I’m hardly going to throw you scraps, especially for a defensive skill. This is me protecting my investment. These are pretty damn good, even for B-grade. Trust me. You'll like them."This tale has been pilfered from Royal Road. If found on Amazon, kindly file a report.\par
“And lastly, here.” He produced a fancy glass vial from his bag of holding, stoppered with a silver cork. “1 B-grade essence vial. This should get you up into the mid-70s. Oh, and—”\par
He counted out 10 high-grade essence stones, palm-sized crystals with brilliant balls of white light suspended at their cores. \par
“Each one of these bad boys is worth 100 mid-grade essence stones. I'd keep them somewhere safe if I were you,” said Elias. He looked depressed giving them away. \par
Zane put them all in his bag of holding.\par
“And that should be it!” Elias clapped his hands. “To a long and fruitful partnership! Do let me know if you ever drop by SF, eh? I’ll take you out to dinner.” \par
He grinned, held out a hand for a high-five. Zane didn’t give him one. He shrugged and high-fived himself. \par
Then he turned, gave a little wave, and left.\par
***\par
It was time to take stock of the war’s aftermath. They'd stumbled on a massive windfall—the Legion had a dragon’s hoard of treasures. Reina put them all to good use.\par
First they found a few Water Law treasures that matched well with Avery’s Balance Laws. After their encounter with Elias—where Avery was essentially backup, in case things went sour—she went off happily on her own, clutching her little Water crystal. Zane hardly saw her again for the next week. He thought she might have left the region entirely—she pretty much came and went as she pleased—until he heard some snoring as he passed beneath an Emerald Forest tree one day, and saw a small figure wrapped in a hoodie, splayed over a branch like a sloth. The Law Crystal was clutched in her hand, somehow. Despite her clearly being asleep. \par
Reina distributed the bulk of the essence stones evenly among their many hundreds of Safe Zones. But she also poured much of it into Luminous Faction headquarters.\par
The buildings were all remodeled via a brand new C-grade Beacon. Their old houses got flowing roofs, and runes on the floors and the walls provided heating and insulation. They were still themed like the Luminous Forest—they were made of logs of the same white bark, and their roofs glowed purple like the tree-tops. \par
The town hall got a second floor. New buildings popped up all around, looking like they'd been plucked straight out of some fantasy world and plopped in the middle of the Highlands. There was a cozy little library for communal Skill tomes. A little market which opened on weekends for treasure-trading. \par
There was a watchtower. It worked like a balloon. Antigravity runes were scribed on its bottom and it floated right in the middle of camp, rising hundreds of feet above the ground. You had to climb a thick chain to get up, the same chain that anchored it to the ground.\par
There were wards set up around the neighborhoods, replacing the old steel walls. You could turn them on and off at will—there was always a stash of mid-grade essence stones to power them. And there were little turret towers too, scattered at the edges of camp, topped with purple foliage, disguised to look like trees.\par
Reina planned to make the Luminous Faction Safe Zone a model for every Safe Zone in the state. She wanted to make it hellishly hard to take even one of their territories, to say nothing of all of them.\par
The dead forest was cleared out too—remodeled via the Beacon into flat, windy plains. These would be used for training. Reina moved all their training dojos over there, and left plenty of space for drilling and sparring. They had a full set now, one for each Class. Their outsides looked the same, these chunky white-wood buildings. The only difference was the symbols scribed above the entrances. That, and their insides. \par
There were even little amenities—a little fountain spewing essence in the middle of the town square, a place you could bask in on hot summer days.\par
These were only things Zane picked up on. The tip of the iceberg. Reina was doing plenty more behind the scenes, he knew. And now that she had a vice grip on their army. They pretty much worshipped her, like she was Joan of Arc. It wasn't hard to settle conflicts.\par
He saw all of this in flashes as he came and went from camp in the following month. He spent most of that time in the Sharpness Cavern of Insight. It became his personal dojo. He made it clear he was not to be disturbed.\par
There, he got to work on that B-grade Law treasure.\par
*** \par
It was tough going. \par
It took Zane nearly 12 hours of grueling meditation to force his way into the Law trance. He sat there, crystal in hand, and brute-forced it. It shocked him how much harder it was compared to his previous tries with Law.\par
At last, late in the night, his world dissolved. And the world stored in the Law crystal unfurled.\par
He blinked; the sun was piercing—but he couldn't seem to escape it anywhere he looked. It flared on a Spire of steel—a spire that stretched higher than any skyscraper he'd ever seen; its tip was lost in a blanket of fluffy white clouds.\par
He looked left and saw a fat steel tower that would’ve been a wonder of the world on Earth. He looked right, and saw wall of steel that running far into the murky orange distance. He blinked again, and finally managed to orient himself. He stood on a winding staircase going up the side of a mountain. And the mountain itself was steel too. It was just one great hunk of dark metal.\par
He stood in the middle of a surging crowd, a crowd buzzing with excitement—they all wore these beautiful silver robes with their hair tied in buns. Their hair was steely silver, their eyes purple. And none of they seemed to see him. He was a ghost in this memory. \par
He felt himself dragged along, up to the very top where a grand citadel awaited them, a dizzying marvel of cascading gray steels. Just looking at it, Zane could feel the immensity of this structure—so much Law radiated off of it it was daunting just to stand in its presence. He wasn’t even there yet he still felt drawn by it somehow, as though the thing had its own magnetic pull.\par
The crowd poured inside, and came to a halt.\par
The hall’s insides were stark and bare, yet somehow brutally beautiful, the way unalloyed pure steel can be. Simple elegant planes, stretching out as far as Zane could see. The inside, he suddenly realized, was much bigger than the outside.\par
A single old man sat at its very center, on a pure black dais, eyes closed, meditating. He was white-haired, with a thick wispy white beard, but his body was that of a seasoned martial artist—rippling with dense muscle. He looked like he’d been carved out of steel himself. \par
He opened his eyes. They glowed intense purple. \par
Then he said, “Listen closely, disciples. I will do this only once. I am here to give a Sermon on the Law! But not a sermon as you are used to. Those Elders of yours like to prattle on and on, for hours, telling all there is to know of a Law… ridiculous! This is the new school, the school of theory. I reject it. I hold to the old ways. The ways that say the only way to learn a Law is to see it, to feel it!” \par
He paused. You could hear a pin drop in the great hall. “Here is my Sermon. It will last the span of one breath! Watch closely. For in this one move, I shall demonstrate all there is to know of the Elemental Law of Steel! I shall create a resonance that touches the hearts of each and every one of you. How much you comprehend depends on you. For those of you with all Major Laws of Steel mastered, this may be the moment you comprehend the full Law, and break through the critical Foundation Bottleneck! So. Pay attention!” \par
He breathed out and held out his palms. There, Laws began to gather… \par
\par


\section{55. Spirit Steel (II) }
\par
The air warped around the Sage's hands, compressing, trembling. His fingers looked like an impressionist painting. Zane could feel the tension hidden between those palms, like there was a whole universe held there, invisible, infinitely compressed—and all Zane could sense was what it gave out. Those tidal-wave ripples of Law.\par
The Sage gave a shout and clapped his hands. There was a ringing, bright, clear, resonant, and instantly Zane's mind went blank. He felt like he'd been struck—not in the body, but the soul. For a second he stood there dazed. A pulse washed out from the Sage's hands and spread in an instant, flowing over everyone in the Great Hall—a shockwave of Steel Law. Zane felt viscerally in that moment the force, the resilience, the control.\par
The hall's steel walls hummed. The statues lining them, the ceilings, the floors all hummed in perfect resonance. So did the Sage's body. As though on some level beyond the physical, they were all one.\par
The Sage opened his hands. They gleamed slightly—they had a little metallic shine to them. His whole body did. Zane could see the Laws streaming off him, streaming through him. He breathed out, and a silvery mist left his mouth—even his breath was dense with Law. Law at a level Zane couldn't hope to understand.\par
The Sage formed a fist.\par
Then he punched. It went slowly, but it felt like everything collapsed to just that punch. Zane couldn't see anything else. That fist became his world. The heaviness of it, the density of it… It was just a simple punch. Yet Zane felt a profound truth hiding in that little motion.\par
And Zane glimpsed it. The surface of the world peeled back, cracked open—\par
The moment passed.\par
The Sage resumed his normal stance. The sheen vanished. And suddenly everyone in that hall drew in a gasp. Nobody could breathe until that moment.\par
The Sage bowed.\par
The scene dissolved.\par
Zane sat there, dumbly. He caught parts of that—little fragments. They felt muddy, unclear. This time everything just felt slower. His mind wasn't in that heightened state of focus—compared to when he last had Law vision… How much had he grasped? Maybe half as much, maybe less? And he could tell this was a better treasure too…\par
Frowning, he stood and checked outside. It was dark. A cool night air greeted him, and he looked up at a spray of stars. Somewhere, crickets were chirping.\par
…That was half a day?\par
Wow.\par
He could have sworn it was an hour at most. As usual, time meant nothing in Law trances.\par
He had the focus; he walked back in, sat down, gritted his teeth. He could do this—he just had to put himself in that familiar place… He'd done it so many times before…\par
He grasped the crystal and tried it again.\par
This time, he found his attention drawn to the way the Sage's body transformed as they clapped—the tiny changes on his skin, in his face—there was a heating, then a cooling, at a minute level. It was still his body, just harder, tighter, stronger. Zane paid as close attention as he possibly could in the instant of that shockwave. And he felt all these things too. The moment it passed him, he felt the resonance.\par
The way steel balanced hardness and flexibility… it imprinted itself in his mind.\par
Law Comprehended! \par
Minor Law of Tempering\par
He drifted back out.\par
An intense fatigue washed over him, dragging at him, and he yawned. It felt like something in his mind was shot.\par
He could tell he was done for the day. He opened his palm and let his new Law dance on his fingers. When he applied it, his skin took on a slight metallic look. This thing had stopped his Axe cold. Now it was his.\par
A day for a Minor Law wasn't bad. But Zane had learned faster in the past.\par
He supposed that was because he had to. He was realizing he had a way of rising to meet whatever challenge was thrown at him—especially if it threatened someone he cared about.\par
…Which was not something he wanted to rely on.\par
It didn't need to be that. Any very high-pressure scenario would do. He learned Laws in fights too. He just needed stakes. Some men were happy in peacetime—some men were comfortable. He felt restless. He needed the next fight.\par
Even for something as simple as Law.  \par
The last time he was in this cavern, he'd taken 6 Law Fruits. That likely helped—but the more he studied Law, the more he realized it’d helped less than he’d thought. It might’ve stacked up to a 20-25\% boost, or something—at the heart of it, he'd still been preparing for war. He'd still been locked in. He just… wasn’t, anymore.\par
He sighed. For now, he'd try to grind his way through this. This issue wasn't one he could solve anytime soon. It went to the core of who he was.\par
He slept and came back the next day, and ground his way into the Law trance yet again. The Sage had said you could find every Law of Steel in that one strike, and Zane sensed he was right. There was so much, he didn't know where to look—he went for something cousin to the Law he just found, like two puzzle pieces that stuck together in an otherwise inscrutable puzzle.\par
He focused on the shockwave made by the Sage's clap, the way his body absorbed and distributed that huge force. He focused on the Sage’s hands. They turned metallic before they connected. He saw the way the force ran up against them—and vanished. Once he looked, truly poured all of his attention on that little detail, he saw an opening there. A place he could look into the great beyond.\par
He saw, he felt the way the fingers diffused the stress—the way it took the force and withstood it, unyielding. There was something profound there… there was a Law at work.A case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.\par
He sat with it in stark concentration, brow furrowed. He felt it working in the vision… he felt it resonate within him. \par
The scene faded, but that crack stayed. He ruminated on it over and over, uncovering the full shape of it, like an archaeologist digging out some ancient long-forgotten fossil that had lain underfoot all along. \par
And at last—near the end of the second day…\par
Law comprehended! \par
Minor Law of Metallic Resilience\par
If tempering wove steel through his skin, this Law let him catch huge forces. Naturally, he tested it by punching himself in the face. Hard.\par
It still hurt. A lot. There was a metallic ringing in his ears as it passed. But he didn't feel rocked… he just felt slapped, stung. Was that a testament to his power, or to the Law? He probably should have tried punching himself before he’d gotten it.\par
Still, he had a feeling if someone else tried punching him—even someone as strong as one of Marcus’s Generals had been—they’d break their hands before they marked his face.  \par
He came back yet again the next day and tried to find the next piece in the scene. It was easier now he had two of them.\par
He focused on the way the Sage moved from clap to punch to rest—all the way through. That was no easy thing. The Sage’s body endured an immense amount of stress—not the instantaneous force of the clap, but what came after. The sheer density of the metal he wove into himself, the burden he was forced to carry. But like metal, he did not bend. He bore that force with grace. There was the opening Zane was looking for.\par
At the end of day three—\par
Law comprehended! \par
Minor Law of Stress Resistance\par
Just one more would complete the set. On the fifth day Zane found it. It was in the way the shockwave rippled out—the way he clapped, the way the force rebounded. And once the shockwave passed through Zane, he felt it too, deeply. And he knew.\par
Law comprehended! \par
Minor Law of Metallic Rebound\par
Every day, every viewing, was grueling. But he forced himself through it. The joy of each comprehension made up for it.\par
Still, though… he was seriously considering fixing a giant sword above his head. It’d drop if he didn't comprehend a Law before the timer was up. He needed something. \par
Putting it all together took two more days of nonstop pondering. \par
Then—  \par
Law comprehended!  \par
Major Law of Unyielding Might (Elemental Laws of Steel)\par
He let out a relieved breath and stood. Time to call it quits. He had just a few plays of the crystal left; now was not the time to use them. At this rate, he wouldn't get a second Law out.\par
The solution to his problem was obvious.  \par
He needed to go out there. He needed to find situations that created that for him. He needed to make his pressure. \par
Every day, his West Coast road trip grew more and more enticing…\par
***\par
After that, he swallowed the Steel Bead.\par
He sat there in The Cave, closed his eyes. He felt it drop deep into his gut and stay there, this bundle of power knotted with Steel Laws. He could start to unspool it with his own Steel Laws, and when he did, they started to saturate his body, starting from the organs in his midsection—his stomach, his liver, his gallbladder, his intestines—and moving outward, radiating to cover his thighs, his calves, his feet, his legs, his hands, crawling up through his neck to his head.\par
And he felt something cold, something incredibly heavy, weave its way through his whole body. Slowly but surely. And it stayed there.\par
The process took all day.\par
Skill learned! \par
Spirit Steel Body (Passive) [Epic]\par
Gives the body the durability and density of Spirit Steel. Extremely resistant to both slashing and concussive damage. Steel grade scales with level.\par
By the end of it, his body felt immensely heavier. He hadn't felt the weight of his body in ages—after his strength sat past a certain number, he felt utterly weightless. Now it took a slight effort to move an arm, a leg. He walked outside and tried jumping. He went up a few yards. \par
Then he landed. And the ground bowed in. His feet sank in as though through freshly fallen snow.\par
“…”\par
Instantly he was eager to try this in battle. Against the monstrous boss of some great C-ranked dungeon, one-on-one, blood running hot, heart thumping wild, life and death hanging on a razor's edge—\par
He found himself panting. He had to remind himself there was just one C-ranked dungeon in the state, and the Iron Legion had cleared it. There were only a few straggler D-ranked dungeons left for the taking. A few pockets of F’s and E’s. And that was it.\par
That very night he started charting his trip.\par
The only reason he didn't set off then and there was because of Reina. He felt he should stay behind and show his support while she settled things. Once the transition was over, though… \par
***\par
He took Elias's lost treasure, the B-grade Essence Vial, and the Levels poured in. It took nearly a full day to absorb them all. \par
They stopped with one last notification—\par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 74 -> 75\par
Which was good for World Rank 42, according to the Essence Beacon. Not bad.\par
*** \par
He took the rest of the month to train, teach Faction members, and pick off a few D-ranked dungeons left in this state. A few were in the Northern Cascades; one was far southeast. He could sense his time was coming. Yet again, that soul-sucking boredom was starting to descend, that wall of grayness. Soon.\par
It was a good time. By then, Reina's councils were well established and running smoothly. Her programs were set into motion. The new Luminous Faction settled into a rhythm. He wasn’t sure precisely, but he figured it’d been about five months, maybe half a year, since the Change.\par
Reina still updated him every night with its goings-on, though half of it drifted in one ear and out the other. He sensed it was as much for her sake as it was for him—she seemed to like spending time with him. It relaxed her. She needed it, with how stressful her days were lately.\par
She seemed to like hugging his arms, or leaning her head on his chest—being close to him also seemed to relax her. As the nights went on, she drew closer and closer…\par
***\par
Early one morning, Zane heard a light knock at the door.\par
He ignored it and tried going back to sleep.\par
Another knock. Then another. He groaned. The knocker was starting to play "The Little Drummer Boy" on the door, and Zane had a suspicion who this was.\par
Groaning, he disentangled himself, pulled off the covers, stepped very gently on the ground so it didn’t creak, pulled on his boxers, a shirt and trousers, and stumbled to the door. He pulled it open just a crack, not enough to reveal the whole room, and looked outside. The sun had scarcely risen; the ground was blanketed in mist.\par
And there was Avery, grinning at him. Her hoodie was black-and-white, like a panda. It had two panda ears on too. \par
"Morning!" said Avery.\par
"Please lower your voice," said Zane, wincing. "You’ll wake the neighbors up."\par
Avery blinked. "Uh. Sure. Hey—have you seen Reina? I couldn’t find her in her cabin."\par
"Reina’s quite worn out," he said. "She had a long night. I’ll pass your message to her when she wakes." \par
“Really? I thought she was taking the night off.” \par
  “…What is it?” \par
“Oh! Okay. It’s just—” \par
Avery blinked.  \par
She must’ve noticed the second white dot in Zane’s cabin. A dot that had been very close to Zane’s just a few seconds ago. “Wait.” \par
He winced. \par
“…It’s not what it looks like.” \par


\section{56. Fire With Fire (I) }
\par
Zane tried coming up with an explanation. He came up blank.\par
It started late one night. Reina had been sprawled against him, whispering softly to him. This had been going on night after night. \par
He didn't feel much emotionally, most of the time, but Reina had a very strange effect on him… and, well, she was a gorgeous woman pressed tightly against him. That… also had an effect on him. As the weeks dragged on it grew torturous. \par
As a last feeble try, he told Reina he couldn't give her anything more than friendship right now. But she said friends could still comfort one another. Then the last thread of his self-control snapped.\par
“You dog!” said Avery. “You fiend! You player!” \par
He winced. “…Seriously?”\par
“How long has this been going on?”\par
He winced again. “A few weeks.”\par
“You slut!”\par
“...” Zane sighed. “She works a tough job. It's just stress relief for her.”\par
“Uh-huh.” Avery didn’t look convinced. “Oh, by the way! Have I told you what I've been up to lately?”\par
“Napping?”\par
“Well, yeah, but I've also been trying to comprehend this new Water Law, and it's just so much work. So much pressure, you know. Just really stressful stuff… I'm just so stressed all the time…” \par
She stared up at him expectantly with her big green eyes.\par
“…”\par
“...”\par
“Sooooo—” \par
He moved to close the door.\par
“Wait wait! Kidding, geez!” said Avery. “I actually have something important to say, I swear!”\par
“What is it?”\par
“I'm heading east,” she said brightly. “I heard you were taking a little vacation down the West Coast. I thought I might do the same now that the Legion's gone. I lost contact with some friends a few states over when this all started. I figure I'll go check up on them, maybe pick up some Skills and Levels along the way, you know?”\par
“Do you want someone to go with you?” said Zane. Avery was very capable, until she wasn’t. \par
“Nah, I got this,” she said. “Oh! I haven't shown you—here, check this out.” \par
She snapped her fingers, and her body warbled a little, like he was seeing her underwater. “It's my new Skill. Here, try punching me.”\par
Then she closed her eyes.\par
“…” He'd gone down this road before, but luckily broken noses healed quickly in this new world. Still, he put very little into the strike.\par
It slipped right off.\par
“Neat, right?” she said, eyes still closed. “It's called ‘Reactive Redirection’! Once I turn it on, it'll redirect stuff even if I don't see it. No more getting randomly wiped out by some lucky archer. I practiced this for two weeks straight in my dreams, and it just gave it to me. Didn't even know you could do that.”\par
Huh. “That is neat.”\par
“Mhm,” said Avery happily. “I'm still working on something offensive. One day I'll be able to beat people up. Hell, one day I'll beat you up. You just wait.” \par
“…Sure.”\par
“So…” said Avery. “I was going to go to you next, but you're already here, so…guess I'll see you around, you big lump.”\par
“See you.”\par
He felt surprisingly sad. He'd miss her. She'd grown on him a lot.\par
“Uh…” Avery scratched her head. “Before I go, just one more question. I’ve always been curious, honestly.” \par
“Shoot.” \par
“Is she freaky? She seems like the freaky type—hey wait! Don't—”\par
The door shut in her face.\par
***\par
As he left, Reina insisted on walking him to the edge of the Luminous Faction borders. There, she gave him a gift—a black bead necklace to wear around his neck.\par
Stealth Beads (C) \par
Masks the wearer’s identity, including Name, Level, Title, Skill, Faction. C-Grade works up to Level 100.\par
"I bought these for you," Reina said, handing them to him, closing his palm around it. Her hand lingered, holding his closed. “You should keep a low profile as you're traveling. If people know who you are, it can be used against you. I compiled a report on your Mount St. Helens trip—this is something Stroud tried to take advantage of. He might’ve succeeded if Avery weren't there. People will know taking you out means the Faction’s easy pickings. And as you go farther, they’ll know you won't have backup close by.” This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
Zane was amused. “You're worried about my safety.”\par
There were probably less than thirty people in the world right now who could pose him any real threat.\par
“Of course I am,” said Reina. She did look worried. “I care about you—” She caught herself. “I mean—just as I would any integral member of the Faction. Just… be careful, alright? I have been talking to some of the other local hegemons. A lot of their leaders do it too when they travel.” \par
Zane could see the appeal in it, if only because he was tired of being mobbed all the time. He supposed some peace and quiet would be nice.\par
Only—"How discreet do you want me to be?” He’d never been the best at subtlety. “Once they know who I am the instant I start fighting?”\par
“I'm not saying you have to hide,” said Reina, “But it's better they don't know who you are or how strong you are unless and until you want them to.” \par
He saw the sense in it. “Sure.”\par
“Here.” Reina came up close and tied it around his neck. His skin tingled where he felt her breath.\par
She stepped back and observed him, then nodded. “When I Identify it all comes up as question marks. And you're just a normal white dot on the mini-map. It works.”\par
“Is that all, then?”\par
Reina nodded.\par
It was time to go. She had given him a bag of holding full of things he'd frankly never need—enough food to last six months, clothing for every weather type, and random things like rope, treasures, tents, camouflage cloaks…she was so considerate. She thought of everything. \par
“And don’t go being stupid and noble for no reason,” said Reina, staring him straight in the eyes. “Your life is most important.” \par
He blinked. “Noble?” That was… not at all how he’d describe himself. He thought he was rather the opposite. \par
“That’s right,” said Reina softly. “You’re the noblest man I know.” He doubted anyone would describe him that way. Except Reina, with her rose-tinted glasses. \par
They stood there facing each other. Neither of them could look each other in the eye. He shuffled a little, and she did too. He cleared his throat. “So.”\par
“… This is it,” said Reina softly. She tucked a lock of hair behind an ear. “Goodbye, Zane.”\par
“Goodbye, Reina.” \par
They kept standing there. Things were getting awkward. Then—\par
“Oh my God, just kiss already!” They both jerked up. There, lying on a nearby tree branch, was Avery. She threw them an irritated look over her binoculars. \par
Which brought that little encounter to an embarrassing end.\par
*** \par
Zane set off for Oregon. First up: C-Ranked Dungeon, Gorge of Elemental Winds. Right on the outskirts of Portland. It seemed to be in the middle of the neighboring Faction's territory. Hopefully they wouldn't mind him dropping by. He'd take care of their problem for them, after all. He didn’t mind sharing the treasures. \par
He went through forest after forest. After a while, they all started to look the same—they looked a lot like they had before the change, just made fantastical, grand, color-shifted. A lot of the folk in the Safe Zones he passed recognized him. Many waved to him, or shouted to him cheerfully; some invited him in for lunch, or for tea. He politely declined.\par
He was too eager to get going. Finally—on the road! He could practically feel the fights looming before him. He was grinning just thinking about it. \par
The last Safe Zone on the edge of Luminous Faction territory was run by a scruffy, white-bearded, pleasant old man named Dale. The man caught sight of him and roped him into a conversation before he could get away. “You take care, sir!” It felt weird for a man more than twice his age to call him Sir, but then Zane had stopped bothering to correct people. “I tell ya,” Dale continued. “That faction down in Portland… they're trouble. Haven't seen much of them, but the little I've seen, I don't like. They almost killed one of mine for getting near that wall of theirs. \par
"Wall?"\par
“Oh yeah. It’s huge and it's ugly as hell. You'll see. They don't like us at all. You'd almost think they were scared of us. Or I guess I should say, scared of you,” Dale chuckled. “Just a heads up.” \par
***\par
Not long after that, Zane crossed out of Luminous Faction territory at last. He could instantly tell where Luminous territory ended and where this other Faction's territory began. Even this far-out Luminous Faction Safe Zone had a quaint little town going, with their own dojos and a little garden for the children to play, and dirt roads leading in and out of the forest.\par
This next Zone was so undeveloped he couldn't tell whether it was a Safe Zone or Dungeon.\par
You have entered:\par
Safe Zone: Borderland Territories (F)\par
Faction: Cult of the Black Flame\par
Black Flame? \par
…They couldn’t be wielders of Fire Laws too, right? Though it’d be interesting if they were. \par
Zane fastened the Stealth Beads around his neck…\par
***\par
The border wall was a monstrosity: thick gray stone, running over with runes. Runes that made it blast-resistant, water-resistant, ice-resistant—resistant to pretty much everything. Brutally hard to crack.\par
Chloe Taylor would know. She and her crew had tried everything this past month, to no avail.\par
In front of it were trenches upon trenches, choked with barbed wire sizzling with electric essence. And behind those walls, spaced out at twenty-foot intervals, lay the turret towers. Get caught in the sight of one of those, and it was over. Guards patrolled the walls at all times of day. It seemed impenetrable.\par
Chloe had to prove it wasn't. She gritted her teeth, narrowed her eyes, and raised the longbow in her hands. Her face was streaked with camouflage paint. She was crouched here, waiting. Trying desperately to keep her hope. She couldn’t. If she lost hope, her crew was finished… but some days, especially lately, she felt close to breaking.\par
Just six months ago she’d been the happiest she’d ever been. She’d just been voted head cheerleader at her community college. Rob, her highschool sweetheart and boyfriend of six years, had just proposed after the most romantic dinner date on a pier by the beach…it was a memory she thought she’d cherish forever. \par
Now she wanted to cry every time she thought of it. \par
How had things gone so horribly wrong, overnight?\par
They'd been trapped in this nightmare of a Forest Dungeon. The very same Safe Zone where she now crouched, hidden in swathes of foliage. And she made it out alive, barely, shivering, feeling like something in her had been broken forever. So many times she just wanted to lie down and give up, let the Monsters take her. And through it all, Rob had been her rock… he'd been so strong for her…\par
The thought made her choke up again. She blinked the tears away, gritted her teeth. She couldn't focus on that, not now; she had to keep her aim straight. The captain of the guard made his rounds every day right about now. He was a pig of a man. As far as Chloe could tell, he’d earned his spot by being the cruelest of them all—and that was saying something.\par
She saw him, and her hands started trembling—not in nervousness this time, but anger. \par
She had to keep it straight—\par
She lined it up, a pause. Her arrow was loaded with all her essence. This shot had to be perfect… There!\par
She let go, and the arrow flew true. It went straight into the guard captain’s neck. His eyes bulged. He choked. Then he toppled, flopping over the edge. \par
That’s for Rob, you fat asshole! \par
Then—all at once—the turret towers swerved to face her. Her heart went to her throat. \par
She ran for her life as the forest erupted around her. A tree ten paces to her left went up in a plume of fire. She cried out, kept running even as the ground trembled beneath her. All she could do was hope now. She just had to keep going, even as she saw trees mowed down left and right…\par
\par


\section{57. Fire With Fire (II) }
\par
By sheer luck, Chloe made it back to base camp, panting, sweating, run ragged.\par
After the last Black Flame raid, they'd lost most of their gear. 'Base camp' now was little more than a barricade of wood planks in a heavily wooded stretch of forest. As she squeezed through into the hidden, dimly lit earth cavern beneath, she saw what was left of the crew. The past two weeks had been especially awful. They'd been whittled down to just thirty or so.\par
They hardly looked up as she came through. Then she noticed how dark their faces were—and how few of them there were.\par
"What happened?"\par
“Black Flame ambush,” gritted Thomas, a Berserker—he’d been a football player at her college, once. Most of her crew had been students—it was how they knew each other. His burly arms were crossed. "They sent in a damned strike force. We took them down, but…"\par
He shook his head.\par
"Who?" whispered Chloe.\par
"Tommy, Eliza, Sammy, Raymond…" Thomas sighed. "It's just us left."\par
And Chloe's heart sank. But there was no time to dwell on it--a scout burst through the crack of an entrance, panting hard.\par
“Incoming!”\par
“Who is it?!”\par
"Don't know," he gasped, "he's got some kind of blocker on, but he's huge!"\par
***\par
He was huge. He was this hulk of a man, starkly handsome, with flat gray eyes. Just looking at him gave Chloe this nervous tingling feeling. It was more than the size of him—it was how he held himself. He had this air of quiet confidence.\par
"I can see you," he said. Chloe froze. ”Come on out."\par
They did, slowly, creeping out of the bushes. They had him surrounded. Her mouth felt dry.\par
"Stay where you are!" said Thomas, but she could hear the quiver in his voice. He held out his axe as a warning. “No weapons.\par
He looked faintly amused. "No weapons," he agreed. "I'm not here for a fight."\par
“You with the Black Flame?” said Thomas.\par
The man blinked. "Right. The cult. No."\par
"Then... who are you?" whispered Chloe.\par
"I'm not from here. I come from up in Washington. The Luminous Faction. I run a Safe Zone up there," said the man. He held up his hands. “Do any of you know where the ‘Gorge of the Elemental Winds’ is? I'm a little lost."\par
They all gaped at him.\par
"Dude," said Thomas, sounding faint, "you've got to get out of here. It's not safe—go back! Go tell that Savage Sage, Neil Elliott's trying to summon a demon!"\par
"Neil Elliott?" The man sounded baffled.\par
"The billionaire. The douche with all those buildings with his name on them? All over Portland?” said Thomas. “You know—he runs that conglomerate. Elliott Corp?”\par
“…I’ve heard of them. They run that department store chain.”\par
“They ran a shit-ton of other stuff too. They had their fingers in everything. After the Change started it became a Faction, that’s the Cult of the Black Flame. He and his big-wig private equity buddies, they found some kind of alien treasure trove—they call it an ‘Inheritance’, or something? It's a bunch of these crazy Skills and Treasures from some—some alien Faction!”\par
"They gave a bunch of dangerous Skills to thugs and convicts," said Chloe, fists clenched. "Skills they use to terrorize the rest of us.”\par
“I see.”\par
“They’ve taken pretty much all of Oregon State by now,” said Thomas. He shook his shaggy head. "You wouldn’t believe some of the shit he’s done. And his son Kyle’s even worse. We made it out, barely. But we’ve still got family in there—look, that’s not the point. The point is, it’s not enough. He wants more. Now he's trying to summon this demon, and get its powers. If he gets this, we're all fucked! We’re running out of time!”\par
Thomas finished breathlessly, desperate. The man looked skeptical. “…A demon?”\par
“A fire demon. It was the last thing Colin—that’s our man on the inside—the last thing he sent to us,” said Thomas gravely. “He caught a glimpse of the Skill Tome Elliott planned on using. Colin gave his life to tell us.”\par
“…”Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.\par
"Just please," begged Chloe, “At least pass it on. Tell them to come and investigate, before it's too late! There's not much time left—he went into seclusion like two weeks ago. He said he wouldn’t come out ‘till he bound the demon. It could be any day now!"\par
***\par
That was… a lot to take in, at once. A pretty wild story.\par
How much of it was true? They seemed pretty unhinged. That story seemed pretty unhinged.\par
And these were a bunch of Level 30s. Their idea of catastrophic was probably some Level 50 Monster.\par
And besides—he didn’t know these people. At all. Whatever this was, he tried to tell himself this was really not his fight.\par
"Look," he said gently. "I'll let the Luminous Faction leaders know. I'm sure they'll send someone to check this out.”\par
And he would send a tip to Reina. Just in case. “But I can’t get distracted by this right now. About those directions—”\par
Just then, a boy burst through the trees. “Incoming!” he screamed. “Black Flame! They’re—”\par
Zane heard a low hum drifting through the forest, coming from all around them, a tightening circle… Seconds later, he got a view of black cloaks edged red, drifting through the trees—in front of him, beside him. He craned his head and saw them behind him too. The stragglers gasped and bunched in all around him, turning to face the new threat.\par
Jackson Hayes (Creature)\par

On and on it went…\par
All Fire Mages? He'd never seen anything like it. And they were all humming the same low note. They all held out staffs like long obsidian rods, and black flames burned at their tips.\par
They weren't like Zane's fire at all. They weren't substantial; these were translucent, wispy, and strangest of all, they seemed to give off no heat.\par
It fascinated him—he didn't know fire could do that. Some Law was at work here, a Law that had to be of the Elemental Law of Fire…\par
The cultist at the very front—Wilson Brown—pulled off his hood. He was a thin man with a thinner face. He smiled.\par
"End of the line, you little rats,” he said in a sing-songy voice.\par
Then he noticed Zane and frowned. “Who the fuck are you?”\par
“I’m just passing by. I need directions to the ‘Gorge of Elemental Winds,” said Zane, helplessly.\par
He had a bad feeling he was about to get sidetracked—and he hadn't even hit his first dungeon yet.\par
“The Gorge of Elemental Winds?” Wilson repeated. He looked at his buddies. His buddies looked back at him.\par
Together, they started to laugh, these shrill, high laughs, like hyenas.\par
“You want our Gorge, do you? Just who the fuck do you think you are?”\par
They started closing in on him. Wilson sneered. “Cat got your tongue? Get a load of this guy! Comes up all blanks! What do you have to hide, huh, skulking around Black Flame territory? Could you be… a Luminous Faction spy?”\par
“Spy?” cackled another cultist. “Just look at the size of that oaf! He’s subtle as an ox! Who’d choose him as a spy?”\par
Oh bother. Zane scratched his head awkwardly. It seemed they were determined to make a scene.\par
“Who knows?” rumbled a third. “I wouldn’t put it past ‘em. They’re fucking morons! Just look at that Savage Sage!”\par
Eh. He supposed he could be, at times—\par
“The man thinks with his cock! You see who he chose to lead his Faction? What a joke!”\par
They all started to laugh even harder.\par
“…”\par
“That bimbo Latina with the big ol’ titties? Can’t even blame him. If I got to tap that every night… ooh, look at the big man! Look how heavy he's breathing! That bimbo’s your boss, isn’t she? We struck a nerve, big man?”\par
“…”\par
As a matter of fact, they did.\par
Out of nowhere one of the stragglers gave a shout and ran for it. It was the burly one, cloaked in brown essence, this bowling ball barreling toward the lines. He must’ve thought it was his chance while the cultists were busy laughing at Zane.\par
He barely made it five steps before a blast of black fire caught him in the face. It burned straight through his essence. He went down screaming. Burning—another straggler, a blonde girl, gasped, “No!”\par
The boy rolled and thrashed, and finally managed to put the fire out. He didn't look singed at all. But he still stayed there on one knee, head hung, breathing shallowly. Like whatever had burned went beyond the physical.\par
***\par
Chloe knelt by Thomas's side, tears in her eyes. “No, no, no—you're okay. Get up, T. You can do this!”\par
Her voice shook even as she said it.\par
“Alright, alright,” sighed Wilson. “If you insist. Fun’s over! Let's clean up the trash, shall we? Start with the big one and work our way down. Gather your essence, fellas, this one might take a while.”\par
They chuckled.\par
They started to hum, and their bodies burned black. Their humming rose to a fever pitch; black flame gathered on the tips of their staffs.\par
The big man just stood there, face dark, quivering slightly. The flames rose, bonfires streaming off the tips of each staff. Then the flames jumped to one another, sharing heat, linking up until they made one great black circle.\par
“Run!” Chloe cried. But there was nowhere to go, and the man was frozen, still trembling—from fear or shock, she didn't know.\par
Then the flames struck all at once in a torrent, this brilliant beam of black fire roaring through the air. It blasted the man head-on. She put her hands to her mouth. She almost couldn't bear to look.\par
He was just some confused neighbor who’d gotten lost at the wrong place at the wrong time. And he paid for it with his life—\par
Then the flames faded, and she choked off.\par
The man looked almost exactly as he had before. Only now he’d looked up, and his face was cold with anger. Pure anger, an anger so intense it made Chloe's heart skip a beat.\par
He didn’t look harmed in the slightest.\par
The cultists blinked at him, faces slack. They looked exactly like Chloe felt. She couldn't understand what she was seeing.\par
“What the fuck? ….why aren't you burning?” said Wilson.\par
The man stayed silent.\par
“Who are you?” whispered another. At the same time—\par
“You're him!” she cried. “You're the Savage Sage!”\par
“…”\par
The moment she said it, it was like they all realized it at once. Who else could he be?\par
Only then did the cultists seem to realize just what they’d gotten themselves into.\par
Slowly, they started to back away. Wilson swallowed. He’d suddenly gone very pale. He tried on a feeble grin. “Look, man—uh. Honest mistake! We'll just, uh, be on our way—”\par
“Don't go,” said the Sage. His voice was tight with anger. “You showed me your fire.”\par
He raised a brow.\par
“Isn't it fair I show you mine?”\par


\section{58. Fire With Fire (III) }
\par
Zane raised an arm.\par
The cultists all ran, screaming, bolting through the trees in a hundred different directions. They were lost instantly in the foliage.\par
“Oh my god,” said the pretty blonde girl. She seemed near tears. “Thank you, thank you, thank you! If you weren't here they would’ve—”\par
“Duck,” spat Zane.\par
She blinked. …What?\par
“If you enjoy living,” said Zane, “Duck. All of you.”\par
Essence started to gather along the ridge of his arm. They still stared, dumbfounded. “Now!”\par
Screaming, they dropped to the ground. Zane let out a tight breath. His arm seared red-hot, pulsing with his fury.\par
He let it loose.\par
Rising Sun Slash!\par
He whipped his arm. The slash ripped out in a full circle. It moved out like ripples in a pond. Incredibly violent, screeching ripples laden with Laws of Fire and Sharpness, seething with enough essence to down a World Ranker.\par
They were there and gone in a flash.\par
He looked around and saw the scorching, glowing red marks they made against the trunks of the trees. It took a second—then they fell, crashing into one another, shoving each other over like huge crackling dominoes, showing more trees stacked behind—and they too had a stark red line running down the middle. There was a massive snapping, massive groaning, a massive thundering thumping, as though the whole forest was caving in at once.\par
The stragglers screamed, covered their ears, ducked into little balls. Zane just watched impassively.\par
Forty or fifty trees, he guessed. That was how far the slash cut.\par
But bark wasn't the only thing it cut. There were some stones bisected. The tops of hills lopped off. But what interested Zane was the flesh.\par
After the thundering stopped, the screaming stayed behind. Zane had to hop on a tree stump to see them properly. The fallen trees got in the way. And besides, it was much harder to see a man when he'd been cut in two.\par
Many had been split right at their waists. They stared at their bottom halves in dumb shock. Some had been lopped off at the legs. They watched as the fire spread out from the cut, swallowing up the thighs, the calves, the feet. Climbing up their torsos, roaring down their arms.\par
Soon they were nothing but ash.\par
Zane looked to the skies and breathed in, breathed out, trying to control the simmering rage in his chest.\par
It was almost funny. He never would have thought he, of all people, would have anger issues. He wasn't used to feeling such intense emotion so quickly—they just… swept him along.\par
He didn’t regret destroying those fools. But he did wish he'd stayed a little more cool-headed. Reina was like a chink in his armor—but he couldn't be frothing every time someone insulted her. Even if they called her a…\par
He was getting angry again.\par
It occurred to him that the logic of his vengeance was that they’d tried to kill him.\par
But all the feeling behind it came from Reina. That seemed… off. He should probably work on that.\par
“Can someone,” he growled, “Please give me some fucking directions?”\par
When he looked at one of the boys, this burly, shaggy Berserker, the boy screamed. Then the boy seemed to realize Zane was not about to kill him.\par
“Yes, sir,” he babbled. “To the gorge, sir?”\par
“Say it.”\par
“Um—it's—it's part of Cult territory, sir. It's built inside the palace! It's where Prince Kyle throws people he doesn't like—he murders people with it, sir!”\par
“My boyfriend, Rob, he tried standing up to him,” said the blonde girl. She looked weepy. “That—that bastard just kicked him in… you have to stop him! There’s thousands of us still stuck in there! They’re working us to death, mister—please, you’ve got to listen to us!”\par
She was on her knees, staring hopefully up at him, almost like she was praying to him. It made him a little uncomfortable.\par
“Stand up," he said, “All of you." He looked at the sky, dragging another deep breath, and sighed.\par
He could feel a detour coming on. And at this point, he was pretty much committed. Fuck it.\par
“What Level is their leader, this Neil Elliott?”A case of theft: this story is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\par
“Sixty-seven,” said the boy. "But he's in seclusion—no one knows where he is. His son Kyle’s in charge right now."\par
"And what Level is he?"\par
“Fifty-eight.”\par
Zane nodded. "And they're the strongest?"\par
“There's a few like Kyle, but... pretty much, yeah," said the boy.\par
For a while, Zane was silent.\par
“Um… mister?” said the girl timidly. "What are you thinking?"\par
He was annoyed. “I was hoping to get in some dungeon crawling before the day was over."\par
That was looking less and less likely. He did some back-of-the-napkin math. It was early afternoon now… could you depose a whole regime before nightfall, and go in in time to fight a Boss?\par
Seemed doubtful.\par
He sighed. This Neil Elliott, with his demon summoning shenanigans… Zane hoped he'd put up a good fight. Otherwise there’d be none to be had for today, probably. He'd been so hyped up, too.\par
There was the logistics too to worry about, now he was thinking on it—after he wiped out the regime, he'd have to think about the people living there. He had a sneaking suspicion they wouldn’t be in any condition to fend for themselves after he freed them. He'd leave a message for Reina and explain everything… he felt a little guilty. She'd been working so hard lately. Now he was throwing another territory for her to integrate, out of the blue. What a mess.\par
“Sir?” said the boy. He and the blonde girl seemed to be the leaders of this ragtag group. They seemed to be about college age. About his age. Yet, just looking at them, and him—they almost seemed like different species.\par
“I'll clear this Cult for you,” said Zane. "Just show me the way."\par
“Um,” said the boy, “are you saying you mean to go on by yourself? Like—right now? Aren't you going to call for—for backup or…”\par
He trailed off under Zane's gaze.\par
"I’ll ask one last time," said Zane calmly. "Which way is the Gorge?"\par
They guided him to the edge of the forest. There was a no man's land stretching a couple of hundred yards, pocked with craters, run through with barbed wire. And beyond, this ugly, looming gray wall glowing with all kinds of runes. Turret towers peeked over the top. Guards walked down the wall's length, longbows in hand, patrolling.\par
“That'll be all,” said Zane. “Don't follow me until the screaming stops.”\par
They all nodded nervously—except for the blonde girl, who bit her lip. “Mister—I don’t, um, mean to question you, but—you should know there's turrets there that are powered by huge stashes of mid-grade essence stones! I've seen them kill a Level 40 in one shot. And even worse, there's this huge cannon back there—it's meant to take out whole armies—if you go out there alone, they'll all be trained on you at once! I—I really think, um—”\par
Zane sighed. This is why he liked to go solo. There was the rare teammate like Reina or Avery who just got it. Most of the time, he found other people a drag.\par
He was just about to explain to the girl what the difference was between him and the Level 40s she'd seen. Then he realized there was an easier way to explain.\par
He just walked out into the open. He heard her squeak behind him. His Chains fell to the ground by his side, rattling the earth; the Axe heads dragged, plowing long furrows down the barren land. His legs caught on chunks of barbed wire—and plowed right through. The trousers were shredded. But his legs were hardly tickled.\par
He was pleased. So Spirit Steel Body passed its first field test.\par
Time to see just how much more it could do. The guards had noticed him by now; they shouted, gesturing madly. The turrets swerved to face him. He cocked his head and waited. They started glowing with power…\par
Then, all at once, they fired.\par
***\par
Chloe screamed.\par
The world went white. For a few seconds, all she could hear was ringing. She almost couldn't bear to look. How many turrets had fired on him at once? She couldn't even count—fifteen? Twenty?\par
It was like watching a building collapse on someone. It didn't matter how strong he was—how could any man survive that?\par
Yet…\par
She made herself look, hoping against hope—and gasped. Her hands went to her mouth.\par
He hadn't just survived. The front side of his shirt had been crisped, torn open, but the skin underneath—flawless.\par
He looked faintly bored.\par
He hadn't even thrown up a shield! He just… took it!\par
He shrugged and kept walking, and the shouts from the guards grew panicked now. Rows of them drew and fired and drew and fired. He didn't bother blocking them, didn't even bother dodging them—like they were beneath his notice. They could’ve been raindrops falling on him. Raindrops that would have killed Chloe if they hit her.\par
“What the fuck?” said Thomas. His voice was high, shaking. “What the hell is he made of?!”\par
The Chains began to glow. He could’ve been taking a walk in the park.\par
Then a huge black steel mouth loomed over the parapets. Chloe's breath caught in her throat.\par
They’d brought out the Titankiller Cannon! It was a C-grade treasure, the most vicious she'd ever seen. She hadn't seen it since the Cult used it back in the Portland civil war—when the Cult had used it to crush their main rivals, the Riverwalkers, with one well-timed blast. A whole army—turned to dust. Just like that!\par
But the Savage Sage just kept walking. Even as the cannon lit up white, even as it spewed a wrecking ball of fire and shining steel, hundreds of tons of smoldering metal, so big it made him seem like an insect in comparison, about to be crushed.\par
He took the blast head-on.\par
Chloe opened her eyes when the world stopped shaking, not daring to believe. The turrets were one thing, but—\par
There he stood.\par
His clothes were in tatters. His hair was a wild mess. But he was smiling, baring white teeth.\par
She felt very faint. She didn’t even know what she was seeing—she just kept staring at him.\par
Then he threw his Axe.\par
The same red scars that had sliced so easily through the forest ran up the wall in giant streaks. She hadn't even seen them cut—one moment they weren't there, the next they were.\par
Then—as though it were not made of magically reinforced steel, as though it was just a massive chunk of butter—everything over the cut just… slid off. It felt so unreal. Steel was not supposed to move like that.\par
The crash threw her off her feet.\par
When Chloe Taylor picked herself back up, her heart was running wild in her chest. That kind of power in just one man—it just didn't even make sense!\par
When this Savage Sage first walked out toward that wall, she couldn't imagine how he'd even survive the turret blasts.\par
Then it felt like she’d seen something straight out of a superhero movie.\par
How could you hope to stop that man?\par
Now she couldn't begin to imagine what could possibly stand in his way.\par
Her mouth felt very dry. Her head swam.\par
He was like some angel of destruction, come to save her from this awful nightmare. She'd hoped so desperately, so many nights, for something to save her. She saw it now—the universe was fair after all—it’d finally answered her!\par
She thought about Kyle Elliott playing his cruel games in his little palace… she thought about the sneer on his face as he threw Rob over the edge. She remembered how utterly helpless she’d felt…\par
An angry joy blossomed in her chest. For the first time in months, her heart felt full. She felt full of hope.\par
You just wait, you bastard, she wiped away tears. Judgment’s coming for you!\par


\section{59. Fire With Fire (IV)}
\par
Well, that was easy.\par
Zane watched a few hundred tons of steel go toppling over as the wall caved in. Its runes glowed uselessly—some had gone totally dull. His fires burned everywhere. Rivers of melting steel pooled over the ground.\par
He leaped over the mess, landing neatly on the other side. He found some turret towers waiting for him, primed to fire. The guards at the top screamed incoherently at him. The cannons spat out a few useless rounds before he cut the tops off.\par
Warriors poured over the burning walls, streamed out from ugly stone barracks, their fists blazing with black flame. Rangers came after, arrows smoldering black. Then came the Rogues in loose formation, streaming black embers. \par
They were dressed in flowing inky robes. Like dark tides coming to drown him. He was surprised at their faces—red with fury, almost demented with it. They seemed to want to kill him quite badly. \par
He made it quick. No need for Inferno Cyclone. He made two little arcs with his Axes, like a painter drawing Rising Sun Slashes in the air. The scars rippled out.\par
This time it didn't even seem violent. Violence was two things clashing, making sparks. But nothing clashed here. The scars simply went through them all at once. In two easy motions he'd sliced an army in half.\par
They didn't seem to know they'd all been cut until the momentum carried them forward, carried their upper halves off of their lower halves. They stared down dumbfounded.\par
The fire gnawed not downward but up. They seemed not to believe what was happening to them—not until it was up to their necks. Then the screaming started. It cut off quite abruptly.\par
Zane didn't wait to watch it all. He just kept walking.\par
There were a few gnarled stone strongholds here and there. When he walked past them he expected to find a city. \par
Instead, he found a wasteland.\par
A warzone. All he saw everywhere he looked was black. Scorched barricades, crumbled walls, buildings hollowed out, cut to half their size, stumped. All seared the color of ash.\par
What had happened here?\par
He walked down the shambling excuse for a street—really just an uneven ash path between piles of smoking debris. He saw heads hiding behind them, eyes shivering—they ducked away as they looked. He heard the clinking of chains.\par
To his right, behind a shabby excuse for a wall, he saw a whole line of ash-streaked people all dressed in rags, cringing. They had cloth sacks and pickaxes in hand. Black tear lines ran down their faces.\par
Zane sighed. \par
He'd take some satisfaction wiping this Cult off the face of the earth.\par
Then there was much screaming, much shouting, much pattering of feet, and suddenly the side streets were alive with people. People in cult uniforms came rushing at him, mobs of them pouring into the street. They all burned with the same black flame. \par
Zane was starting to get an idea of how it worked. He saw the Warriors rushing at him—burning with their own flame. It seemed to enrage them, to inflame their spirits even more. He checked one of them out, the angry-looking guy swinging for Zane's head. \par
Darren King (Creature)\par
Essence Level 31\par
Class: Berserker\par
Faction: Cult of the Black Flame\par
Laws: Minor Law of Spiritual Incandescence (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Key Skills: \par
Soul Fire (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Ignites the soul, temporarily greatly boosting Strength at the cost of Vitality\par
Oh, pretty cool. So the fire was inside them. Burning inside out—a fire of the spirit. Then he dodged, hefted a Chain, and slapped the guy into oblivion. \par
He felt it when the Rangers shot at him too. The arrows tried burning him, but not his body. They went for his soul.\par
If Zane had to guess, this Major Law had to do with the more spiritual, mystical kinds of fire.\par
Whatever the case, he just kept striding up the street, swatting cultists aside like flies. They just weren't interesting to him—and none of them could really hurt him. They kept throwing fires at him, but what good was a fire that couldn't ignite? Only he knew that Law.\par
After he splattered a few dozen of them, most of them seemed to get the message. They started treating him like a natural disaster—not something to be resisted, something to be survived. They started getting the hell out of the way. Good choice.\par
The city was so hollowed out there was scarcely a building above four stories. He picked out the palace pretty easily. It was the one shining splendor in the barren desert. It looked faintly Roman, but with glossy black columns instead of white marble, accented red, with a grand obsidian dome. A set of wide steps led up to two fat crimson steel doors.Unauthorized duplication: this narrative has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\par
He saw it on the mini-map—half of it lay on one Safe Zone, half of it in another, and between them was the C-ranked dungeon Gorge of Elemental Winds. What an odd design.\par
He made it onto the grand avenue leading straight to the palace, and here the Cult seemed to be making its last stand. They'd dragged out a huge row of gleaming silver cannons.\par
Then they peppered him. \par
One socked him in the eye. Another one just punched him in the jaw, a third in the gut, and he was surprised to find they actually hurt. Well, "hurt." They felt like paintball shots. They were more annoying than anything. \par
He got out his Axes and went chop-chop. One Axe swept through from the left, the other swept through from the right.\par
And each cannon they cleaved exploded on impact, like balloons. It was weirdly satisfying popping them. Then he popped the people manning them, who insisted on running at him screaming bloody murder. The thing about his Axes, especially now he had Rising Sun Slash on hand, was they had gotten incredibly efficient. Two slashes could bring down an army.\par
Skill up!\par
Rising Sun Slash I -> II\par
Speak of the devil.\par
Then there was the last line of defense.\par
A circle of hooded men waited for him right outside the steps. A glut of fire mages, all Level 40s and 50s—he figured these were the strongest of them. Their cloaks were billowing, trimmed with gold. Their staffs burned at the ready, Laws shimmering off them. They hummed an ugly tune. They'd been waiting for him—they seemed to be charging something…\par
As he drew closer, they shouted as one—and their fires streamed together, congealing into one boiling black ball.\par
A giant flaming hand reached out, up to the arm, then another. A black-fire head burst out the top; obsidian gems made the eyes. The torso burned down, swelling to thick black legs, until it was complete. A monstrosity of flame and brimstone.\par
He checked it out. \par
Hellfire Golem (Constructed Creature) \par
Essence Level 70\par
Laws: Law of Ethereal Flame\par
Hellfire Hand (Active) [Uncommon]\par
A strike burning with Hellish flames, scalding the soul.\par
Molten Crush (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Drags the enemy into the Golem's embrace, crushing them to dust under intense heat and pressure. A powerful finishing move. \par
He'd never seen anything like it—you could combine Skills with other fighters? His first thought was, if Reina got her hands on something like this, she'd have a field day. \par
Then the Golem hit him.\par
Just slapped him open-palm, blisteringly fast, and he slammed halfway down the street into a crumbling building. Its floors crashed down on his head.\par
The Golem bellowed.\par
…\par
Well, that was annoying. Coughing, he picked himself up and walked out into the street. That actually kind of hurt. \par
He felt scorched there in a way that felt incredibly odd, since he only knew pain physically or emotionally. But this was weird; it happened somewhere in between. He couldn't pin it down to a place on his body. It really had whacked him in the soul.\par
Not enough to do much other than annoy him. Souls… he hadn't thought much about them. He was sure they had something to do with Law comprehension. He wasn't an idiot, but he didn't think himself smarter than the next guy. Yet he grasped Laws far quicker than anyone he knew. It seemed to him he had a feel for how the world worked, an intuition that seemed to outstrip anyone he knew—and he suspected by a rather large margin. Only Avery came close.\par
Then there was that time under the Lava Falls when he could sit there for hours on end, and she almost passed out… that was 'Soul Power' too, whatever that was. He seemed to have been endowed with quite a lot of it. \par
Only why wasn't it defined anywhere? Why didn't it show up in his Stats? Was it innate? Could it be trained? Very odd.\par
… It was telling how bored he was, that he was getting off on random tangents like this mid-fight. He figured he should probably stop procrastinating and depose this damn regime already. A lot of it was he was dreading explaining the whole thing to Reina, if he was honest. \par
Sighing, he stepped out to face the Golem.\par
 It roared and charged him.\par
This Golem was made by the Fire Mages. Fire Mages who stood way back there on the steps, cloaking themselves in a cocoon of black flame. He chucked another Axe at them—\par
The Axe had only gotten halfway there before the Golem slapped him again. He tried dodging, but nimbleness was not one of his strong suits. Instead he blocked it. He still went flying, this time into another wall. He was starting to get annoyed. Fine. Let's make this simple.\par
The next time it came for him, he chopped clean through one of its legs. Sharpness cleaved through it and it fell off balance; the torn-off limb smoked to nothing. It swiped for him and he leaped over, Axes whirling, and chopped off another leg. He'd take this thing apart piece by piece if he had to—\par
Then its arms clamped down around him like a bear trap, smothering him. \par
They started to constrict, crushing him tighter and tighter—an immense brute force powered by the essence of dozens of mages. It seemed to be putting everything it had into this one crush. And in that moment, Zane experienced a force like two hydraulic presses smashing in on him on either side, a force like he'd never felt before. The Golem roared in triumph.\par
The arms closed tight… and stilled.\par
Then its arms began to tremble. And slip. The Golem blinked, baffled. \par
Inch by inch, those massive arms were forced open to reveal a man at its center, face drawn tight, muscles working furiously. He grunted with the effort; he was grinning. Just brute force set against brute force. And with one last screaming effort, he blasted the Golem off and stood there panting, muscles slicked with sweat.\par
No Skill. Pure strength. \par
That was unexpected. It actually made him work. That was kind of fun, actually.\par
Only... that seemed the end of it.\par
He blinked—he was hoping for another round but the Golem was smoldering out. Up on the steps, the mages were collapsed in shuddering heaps. Their essence was gone, their shield was gone.\par
They'd really poured everything they had into that crush. It was a shame—they didn't know they were trying to crush a crusher. Zane's first love had been brute force wrestling. He still longed to go back to it sometimes. You were just not going to beat him in a contest of raw power. Even if it was the combined essence of nearly thirty mages, set against just his body… And his body won.\par
His new steel body had taken turret fire, cannon fire, and now the crush of a giant magma Golem. And he still seemed unscathed. Elias had been right. This was a hell of a passive Skill. Zane was quite pleased.\par
He had a funny thought. His body was at a point now where he could've walked in here and wrecked them. All without using a single Skill.\par
He took care of the last of the Mages. This was probably the elite of their military. A few slashes turned them to essence. \par
Now nothing stood between him and the palace. \par
\par


\section{60. Fighting Fire With Fire (V)}
\par
"Any last words?" said Kyle Elliott. Prince Kyle Elliott, now.\par
"Yes," rasped the man, whose name was James or Jay, or something. There were tears in his eyes. He said he'd been a firefighter before the Change. A firefighter in the Cult of Black Flame! Kyle should've known it was a bad fit from the getgo. "Please—tell my wife I—ahh!"\par
Kyle pulled back his foot and watched the man tumble off the bridge straight into the Gorge of Elemental Winds. He giggled. They never saw it coming. It was hilarious every time, too—oh man, the looks on their faces! He got the idea from the movie "300" with the Spartans. Sick movie. He wasn't sure how many times he'd done this, but it must've been getting close to 300. He sniggered. It never got old.\par
"Alright!" he shouted. "Next!"\par
His guards bowed their heads and went to grab the next prisoner in the chain.\par
He stood on the bridge connecting one massive courtyard to the next—bridging the two halves of the palace. They went right over the Gorge of Elemental Winds. Dad had been against putting the palace here, but Dad had always been a pussy. That was why he needed someone like Kyle, someone with freaking vision.\par
The prisoners were separated into two halves. One on the left side, with hundreds chained together, was the troublemakers. The people who tried to incite rebellion, or talk shit about him, that kind of thing. On the other side was his harem. Much smaller, two dozen or so of Portland's sexiest—he'd lined them all up and hand-picked them himself. It took a few hours, but he was very happy with the roster he ended up with. He got that idea from Star Wars. He even gave them costumes like Slave Leia's.\par
He sighed. This world really was just so much better than the old world. Here he could make all his fantasies come true. Whatever he wanted, he could go out and get! It was freaking awesome.\par
Before the Change, he'd just come back from a hunting trip in Africa—he and Dad shot a few rhinos, which was okay, but it had nothing on this. And in this new world, there were no dumbass Steve Irwin wannabes coming after him in the Insta comments either. They were all dead, probably. He giggled at the thought.\par
A guard hauled up the next prisoner, bound and gagged. The guard whispered the prisoner's offense in Kyle's ear.\par
Kyle's face twisted in anger.\par
Then they left him to decide the man's fate. It was a portly, unassuming-looking middle-aged man with a little gray mustache. He looked like a librarian or an accountant or something.\par
"Sam Tankersley, is it?" breathed Kyle. "My men say they caught you mouthing off about me! What was it? I was a 'petty tyrant,' was it? Hmm?"\par
He ripped the gag off the man's face. "Here. 'Cause I'm reasonable, I'll let you take back what you said. And maybe—just maybe, I'll spare you. If you seem sorry enough, that is."\par
Kyle wouldn't, of course. But it'd be funny to see the man try.\par
Annoyingly, though, Sam Tankersley wasn't even looking at him. He was looking at the chain of prisoners—at a girl who was next in line. "No matter what happens," he said, choking up, "I love you."\par
What the fuck?\par
The old fuck wasn't even paying attention to him! Who was that bitch anyway? They looked pretty similar… Wait, was that his daughter?\par
Kyle squinted at her, then smiled. He had a great idea. Then he checked her out and frowned again. She wasn't even pretty. Whatever.\par
"Didn't you hear what I said, you fat fuck?" he snapped. But the man just closed his eyes, shivering. He was stiff as a board.\par
Kyle thought about kicking him over now, but it wouldn't be as fun. It was so much more fun when they were scared of him.\par
"Look at me!" he shrieked. Sam Tankersley did nothing. "Look. At. Me!"\par
The man wouldn't do it. His eyes were squeezed shut.\par
"ARGH!!!"\par
Kyle just started kicking the shit out of him, kicking him 'till he was whimpering and bloodied, screaming, "LOOK! AT! ME!"\par
At some point, the man passed out, which only made Kyle madder. He kept kicking him. Weak little bitch.\par
He was still doing it when the guard burst into the courtyard doors, panting. "Master!" the man screamed.\par
"What?" snarled Kyle. "Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?!"\par
There was a massive crash in the distance—it sounded like a building toppling. Huh.\par
"The Wall, Master, it's fallen!" cried the man. "Someone's coming!"\par
"Who?"\par
"We don't know. We think—we think it could be the Savage Sage! He's broken the army—the Royal Guard's trying to hold him at the gates, but they're—"\par
Kyle perked up. "Wait. Did you just say Savage Sage?"\par
"Yes! Master, we've got to evacuate! I've sent men to call your father, but by the time he comes it could be too late—"\par
Kyle started smiling. "No freaking way! We're not running."\par
"What?!"\par
"You're telling me I have the chance to kill the Savage Sage? Me?"\par
His head was swimming. He could just imagine it—the awe on everyone's faces when they heard. He was relishing telling Dad 'I told you so.' He'd always thought Dad's biggest pussy move was putting up a wall between them and that Savage Sage. Kyle had offered time and time again to take a strike force and stomp him out. From what Kyle heard, the guy was just some mouth-breathing meathead. Easy pickings! But bitch-ass Dad never let him.Stolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.\par
"Not until I fuse with the Greater Demon!" Dad had said. Little bitch.\par
"Master, you don't understand, he's breached the wall!"\par
"So?" scoffed Kyle. "I could do that too!"\par
"Master," the servant seemed on the verge of tears. "Master, please. You have to—"\par
"Abyssal Flame!" Kyle screeched. Then he threw a blast of Abyssal Flame at him, and the man screamed, ducking. It barely missed.\par
"You fucking imbecile," said Kyle. "Have I ever lost a fight?!"\par
Never—that was the answer. Every single battle Kyle had led in the Portland Civil War, he'd crushed.\par
"Master—please—that was against small Factions twenty Levels beneath you," said one of his bitch-ass advisors. He also looked nervous. "The Savage Sage could have ten, maybe twenty Levels on you! This—please, Master, we must retreat!"\par
"Ten? Twenty? Who cares?" Kyle rolled his eyes. "It's not the quantity, it's the quality. Dumbass."\par
For some reason, they all looked dazed. It was pissing him off.\par
"Am I your master, or not?!" he shouted.\par
They hung their heads. "... Yes.”\par
"Then prepare for battle!" he roared.\par
***\par
Zane strode through the Crimson Steel doors. They opened into a vast foyer. The floor was polished black marble. Sleek black columns lined the hallways, arching into gothic high ceilings. The whole place was dimly lit—tiny flames encased in glass orbs hovered above, casting long dancing shadows down the corridors.\par
He strode through the palace, expecting resistance, and found nothing. There were a few white dots on the mini-map, but they turned out to be just servants cringing behind drapes or under tables, chains binding their feet and wrists.\par
It wasn't until he reached the other side and came out into the outer courtyard that he found what he was looking for.\par
A flat expanse of dirt. Some fifty-odd yards away, the Gorge of Elemental Winds loomed; he heard its ghostly howls. But there were people standing between here and there.\par
There were prisoners chained to either side, shivering. But it was the people in the middle who caught his eye.\par
There were ten or so cultists in slick black robes. A quick scan showed him all of them were in the Level 40s and 50s, and all of them had a Law called the Law of Fiery Rebirth—along with a certain skill.\par
Rebirth in Flame (Active) [Epic]\par
Fire destroys, and fire remakes. Restores and regrows that which was lost.\par
All of them were currently spamming that Skill—pouring streams of flickering red essence into the person standing before them. A chubby blonde man who stood there grinning.\par
Kyle Elliott (Creature)\par
Essence Level 57\par
Class: Fire Archmage\par
Laws:\par
Minor Law of Spiritual Incandescence (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Minor Law of Celestial Flames (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Key Skills:\par
Celestial Inferno (Active) [Rare]\par
Draws energy from celestial events like solar eclipses, comets, and planetary alignments to unleash devastating spells of fire.\par
Abyssal Fire (Active) [Rare]\par
Creates a soul-scalding fire that inflicts deep spiritual trauma. Targets both the physical body and the soul, inflicting intense pain and potentially permanent soul damage.\par
Zane blinked.\par
… What was this clown show?\par
"Savage Sage! We meet at last!" cried Kyle. He waved his staff about like a bad magician. "The name's Kyle Elliott. Remember it well! It'll be the last thing you ever hear!"\par
What?\par
"Come, and face your doom!" cackled Kyle.\par
Kyle raised his staff, catching the light of the sun, and it began to glow brighter and brighter. He seemed to be charging that 'Celestial Inferno' Skill of his. Zane was baffled. He wondered if he was being tricked.\par
The Skill seemed to be reaching its apex. A neat little ball of light had gathered at its tip. "En garde!" roared Kyle. "Hi-yaaaa! Celestial Inferno!"\par
He thrust out the staff.\par
But Zane thrust out his Axe first, which chopped off the arm, which chopped off the connection to the staff, which chopped off the essence flow.\par
The staff clattered unceremoniously to the ground. So did everything past the man's elbow.\par
Kyle seemed baffled as to why Zane hadn't been roasted to a crisp. Then he looked down at the ground—at his severed arm. It took a beat.\par
Then he shrieked, clutching at the stump, and dropped to his knees.\par
"Fuck!" he screamed.\par
"…" Zane was starting to think he wasn't being tricked.\par
The man was just a moron.\par
Zane advanced on him, then blinked—something curious was happening. A white fire was burning on the wound. The arm was regenerating in real-time. New flesh and bone burned into being. It was the work of that Rebirth in Flame skill—the work of those Mages hard at work in the background, buffing the man up.\par
That Law... Zane squinted at it. 'The Law of Fiery Rebirth'? He swore he'd seen this somewhere before… didn't that Molten Phoenix, back in Mount Saint Helens, have something similar? So curious. He drew closer, inspecting it.\par
Kyle, meanwhile, had scrambled back up. He cried out, "Time out! I quit!"\par
He shot Zane a scathing glare. "No fair. You didn't let me finish!"\par
Zane kept coming. Kyle frowned. "Didn't you hear me, you fucking moron? Are you deaf, or just as dumb as you look? I said time out! We're done. You can go back to whatever zoo you crawled out of—"\par
Zane slapped him so hard spittle, then blood, then bloody teeth went flying.\par
Kyle screamed, falling over. For a second he lay there stunned. Then he looked at Zane, eyes wide, trembling, and screeched, "You hit me!"\par
Interesting. The teeth were growing back in real-time, just like with the arm stump. A pale fire burned at the gums. Zane could see the Laws peeking out, little cracks. He needed to see more.\par
"How dare you—"\par
Zane slapped him again. Shrieking, the man went over. This time Zane hit him a little harder, just enough to break his nose. Sure enough the nose started burning, mending with flickering ghostly flames. Zane stared closely. Yes—this was the Law of Fiery Rebirth. It must've been there when the Molten Phoenix regenerated too. But back then he hadn't been well-versed enough in Fire to catch it live. So many of those Chambers of Insight were the same way. They had more secrets than he could pick up. But he could see it now intimately, now he paid close attention. Literally a touch away.\par
This was surprisingly helpful. So far, slapping the shit out of this brat was like his own personal Chamber of Insight. It was also a lot more amusing.\par
Kyle scrambled up to his feet, tears in his eyes. "That's it!" He sniveled. "Now you're in for it—Abyssal Fire!"\par
Zane ducked as black fire whistled past him. Why would you scream the name of the Skill you're using before you used it? Zane slapped the silly man again, and he went over reeling.\par
"You bitch! I'll kill you! I'll fucking—"\par
Slap.\par
"You little—"\par
Slap.\par
"I—"\par
Slap.\par
"Once Dad hears," slobbered Kyle. "You're fucked!"\par
Zane could feel himself getting close.\par
Slap. Slap. Just a few more and he'd get it—\par
"UNHAND HIM!"\par
Zane looked up.\par
There, on the distant horizon, was a dark cloud that blotted out half the horizon.\par
A man was flying toward them, a small sun boiling with black fire. So this must be Neal Elliott. That was quite a bit of aura. Zane was impressed. Whatever demon he'd summoned, he'd bonded pretty well with it. Could be an interesting fight.\par
"That's right," slurred Kyle. The man-child had gotten to his feet. He was grinning smugly now. "Oooh! You're fucked now, bitch!"\par
…Was he, though? Neal Elliott was speeding toward them, but he was still pretty far off. Something like twenty or thirty seconds away, probably. Zane did some back-of-the-napkin math. He figured it'd be enough.\par
He felt kind of bad about what he was about to do. Then he saw the prisoners chained to the walls. They were all staring at him slack-jawed, with a mixture of awe and hope...\par
He stopped feeling bad.\par
Zane slapped the man, and he went down squealing. But before he could fall, Zane back-handed up back upright. He socked him in the nose and broke it. He socked him in the ribs, broke those too. He kneed him in the gut, then ripped two hooks there, and was pretty sure he'd exploded every major organ. Kyle went over howling.\par
The Fire Mages had their work cut out for them. They healed furiously—and in came the Law of Fiery Rebirth, flooding Kyle's body. Zane inspected the man's caved-in torso, then his squished-up, crying face.\par
“I’m sorry!” sobbed Kyle. “I yield, I yield!"\par
There it was!\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Fiery Rebirth\par
Neal wailed. He was getting pretty close—he'd crossed into the Safe Zone at the other side of the Gorge.\par
"YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT, SAVAGE SAGE!" Neal screamed.\par


\section{61. Fighting Fire With Fire (VI) }
\par
Neal came close enough to Inspect. He was a thin man, sharply featured, with the sort of face that seemed to be scowling even at rest. Right now it was not at rest.\par
It was trained on Zane, and it was drawn tight with anger.\par
Neal Elliott (Creature)\par
Essence Level 75\par
Class: Fire Archmage\par
Laws:\par
Major Law of Ethereal Flames (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Key Skills:\par
Celestial Inferno (Active) [Rare]\par
Draws energy from celestial events like solar eclipses, comets, and planetary alignments to unleash devastating spells of fire.\par
Rebirth in Flame (Active) [Epic]\par
Fire destroys, and fire remakes. Restores and regrows that which was lost.\par
Soulfire Sacrifice (Active) [Epic]\par
Burns one's lifespan in exchange for a massive surge of demonic power. Only granted to those who bonded to Azeroth.\par
"Die!" snarled Neal. He raised his arms to the high heavens.\par
The sun's rays shot into him. They sped up as they got close till they were thin gold lines shooting through him. They poured in all over in their thousands, a corona of pinprick lights. And he began glowing an eerie black light.\par
Zane recognized it. It seemed to be the same Celestial Inferno Skill his son had used, but at a much higher Tier.\par
As it charged, Zane got out an Axe and stacked it with Laws of Sharpness.\par
Neal blasted the beam. And Zane chucked his Axe to greet it. Flaming Axe met a ray of light.\par
The Axe cleaved the beam down the middle. One beam went left, the other right.\par
The beam going right hit plain dirt and exploded. The beam going left hit Kyle right in the face.\par
Zane thought he heard a shriek; the beam stopped for a moment, finished off what was there, and kept going. It wiped out the Mages behind Kyle too.\par
By the time Neal stopped the Skill, they'd all been charred to dust.\par
Kyle Elliott's headless body flopped to the ground. Neal and Zane both stared at it.\par
Then Kyle dissolved into essence. And flowed right into his dumbstruck, shaking father.\par
Neal choked. For a few seconds, he hovered there trembling.\par
Then he turned twitching to Zane. "YOU!" He screamed. “I’ll KILL YOU!”\par
Which seemed rather unfair to Zane. Whose fault was that really? Kyle’s essence hadn’t gone to Zane, had it?\par
But Neal Elliott was beyond reason. He seemed deranged, which… Zane could understand, given the circumstances.\par
Neal began to glow a deep red, a red like dried blood.\par
"I prayed," he choked out, "To the demon Azeroth, ruler of the Void Planet. In exchange for a fraction of my soul, he granted me powers forbidden to man! Savage Sage! Bear witness to TRUE MIGHT!"\par
And he began to expand. Demon horns reared out of his skull. Bat-like wings broke through his back, gaining new bones, swelling faster and faster. Every limb of his blew up, growing gnarled and scaled and dark. Twice its size, thrice, four times…\par
"Witness my SACRIFICE!" he raged.\par
Zane cocked a brow. "You're burning your life force?"\par
"All of it!" shrieked Neal. His eyes bulged. The veins stuck out stark red. "It'll all be worth it if you BURN IN HELL WITH ME!"\par
Now, Zane had a few Levels on him. And a Signature Title. And two extra Major Laws. But still... that was a lot of Aura. It was starting to swell larger than his own…\par
Oh, my. He was getting nervous.\par
The good kind of nervous—the kind of nervous that put a smile on his face.\par
Neal Elliott was going all out. Zane figured he should too.\par
Neal was still growing—he'd blown up to the size of a skyscraper now. Batlike black wings speared out of his back, dwarfing the horizon. His face distended, drawing outward, warping into something between a human's and a dragon's. His eyes burned crimson in his skull, smoldering like dying embers.\par
He reared up, bellowing a deep furious note. And pitch-black fire leaked from his mouth.\par
He was gathering his powers for one all-out blow.Stolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.\par
Zane did the same.\par
He started loading essence into his Axes. He threw on the Major Law of Absolute Sharpness, he threw on the Major Law of Scorched Wrath, and all through his body he weaved the Major Law of Unyielding Might. His Axes started glowing blistering hot. So did the black star of flame in Neal Elliott's hideous mouth.\par
Zane leaped into the air.\par
They threw at the same time.\par
A furious black beam shot out at him. And he returned fire: Rising Sun Slash!\par
Two rising white slashes met a falling waterfall of raging ink. Zane's Axes rose, cleaving through it, struggling against that dense tide. But there was an otherworldly power bearing down on them, a power too great to resist. They forced their way halfway up…\par
But they couldn't hold.\par
They were blasted aside. The beam shot forth. And Zane's eyes widened.\par
He tried to dodge.\par
He couldn't.\par
***\par
Neal Elliott saw the shock on the Savage Sage's face. He felt the moment his blast hit the man's body.\par
It batted him right out of the sky and drilled him straight into the ground. The flames cooked him alive—but it wasn't the fires of the flesh that hurt the most. It was the fires of the soul.\par
Neal's fires swamped the man. His soul lay defenseless before him, tender, vulnerable… and Neal's demonic fires savaged him. Neal felt a shocking chunk of soul go up in flame—enough to kill a man thrice over. It was shocking—Neal hadn't expected him to have so much. He guessed Zane Walker was a World Ranker for a reason.\par
Was.\par
The Savage Sage spasmed and went still. The man's body lay face down, still smoking.\par
He didn't get back up.\par
And Neal Elliott let out a shrill laugh. He felt his life force ebbing out of him, felt the aching hole in his soul, the grievous price he'd paid…\par
But it was worth it.\par
To the side, one of Kyle's women gasped. "No!" she cried. "Get up, Savage Sage, get up!"\par
He didn't.\par
Neal sneered. The man could posture all he liked. But in the end, Neal crushed him like any other gnat. Signed or not, he fell like all the rest.\par
He only wished Kyle were here to see it. Poor Kyle…\par
He’d gotten his vengeance, at least.\par
He watched on, feeling smug, as the Sage's massive body dissolved to essence….\par
He squinted.\par
Wait.\par
That… wasn't essence. That—was that…white flame?!\par
A deep-throated groan came out of the Savage Sage's charred body. And one massive arm moved, propping him up to an elbow. The skin had all burned off the flesh. But he blinked, and stared up, and frowned.\par
White flames danced over his skin. New skin thrived in its place.\par
Neal's mouth hung open.\par
"But—" he blubbered. "But I hit you! I felt your soul melt!"\par
"Yeah," rumbled the Savage Sage. "You did hit me. That fucking hurt."\par
Then he stood. He grinned.\par
"You're dead! You should be dead thrice over!" croaked Neal. He didn't understand. "You—you've made a pact with a demon too! It lent you its soul!"\par
Zane blinked, baffled. "…No?"\par
"Then how?!" Did this Savage Sage have a treasure on him? But Neal would’ve felt it. No—he was sure he’d struck that man dead in the soul!\par
He should be in a coma, at least. Losing just half his soul should've done that!\par
But Zane Walker seemed fine. Wincing a little, but fine. It didn’t make sense!\par
…Unless...\par
Unless this Savage Sage had so much soul that Neal had only melted a tiny fraction compared to the rest of him.\par
Just how much soul power was he endowed with?!\par
"Round two?" said the Savage Sage. He got out his Axes.\par
Neal screamed. He turned—all several hundred feet of him—and flew as fast as he could, batting his massive wings. He had to make it to the Gorge! If he could dive down there—\par
Suddenly he was moving very fast, faster than he'd thought possible. It must be his desperation—he tapped into a wellspring of energy he didn't know he had. He felt a wild excitement; he'd make it out!\par
He glanced down and saw nothing but air.\par
And he realized it wasn't him that was moving very quickly. It was just his head.\par
His body was quickly receding behind him into the distance.\par
He screamed one last time.\par
And everything went dark.\par
***\par
Zane's head pounded.\par
His body was pretty unhurt. But he still got a warning that he'd dipped under 50\% health.\par
Soul damage, huh.\par
He still didn't have much clue what to do about it. Tanking it had worked fine-ish for him so far, but when something truly massive struck him—like that black beam—he'd been so hurt he couldn't get up for a good ten or twenty seconds there.\par
That was death in any other battle.\par
Neal Elliott's giant demon body dissolved into a whirlpool of white essence. It swirled into him.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 77->78\par
But something else fell out from that body, something that didn't dissolve. A murky orb the same color Neal's eyes had been. It rolled to a halt. Zane inspected it.\par
Orb of Azeroth I (C)\par
The First Tier inheritance of the Greater Demon Azeroth, the Void Fire Sovereign, ruler of the planet that bears his esteemed Title. Peer within, mortal and gain powers forbidden to man!\par
The First Tier contains: …\par
It was pretty much all the Skills he'd seen the Cultists use. Plus a Law tacked on at the end—the Major Law of Ethereal Flames. There was some kind of Law trance in here, Zane gathered. He skimmed down to the end.\par
But greater powers yet await. For the daring, for the ambitious, in exchange for but a fraction of your soul—\par
Zane stopped reading.\par
Huh. So this was that 'Inheritance' those stragglers had been talking about—what the whole Cult was based on. Just a bunch of Skills plus a Law package in one. They seemed related to each other too. Quite a windfall. It might be ranked C, but it was really a bunch of C-ranked treasures bundled in one. \par
Most of these Skills didn't interest Zane so much. They weren't really his style. But there was that healing Skill, Rebirth in Flame. And a soul defense Skill too, 'Hellfire Cloak,' that he could really do with.\par
Just applying the Law of Fiery Rebirth on its own lightly cleaned up surface-level wounds pretty well. But he'd seen those Fire Mages regrowing Kyle's limbs in real time—could he do that for himself?\par
He was just one person self-healing… probably not at the rate they were doing it. Even just patching up serious internal wounds in the heat of battle would be really useful. It was like using essence and Law to temporarily mimic the effects of a super-high Regeneration stat. It tickled him.\par
Then there was the Law hidden within. The Major Law of the Ethereal Flame…\par
Now that Zane had one fire Major Law, he could vaguely make out the scope of the elemental Law that held it—the Elemental Law of Fire. He wasn't anywhere close to it yet. Maybe… a fifth of the way there? A sixth?\par
This orb would help him get one step closer.\par
He breathed out and looked around. He could sit down with this and try to suss out whatever Fire Laws he could. Try to nab some Skills before he hopped into the Gorge…\par
The sun was close to setting.\par
Then—\par
Of course. He blinked and looked around. These people were still in chains. One by one he went through and cut them off, finding himself swamped in that usual ritual of sobbing and thanking, and he realized, slightly depressed, that he'd been right. No dungeon crawling was happening today.\par
Then came the part he was dreading. The part that was unfortunately necessary, since it was clear these people were in no condition to fend for themselves.\par
He claimed the Safe Zone and messaged Reina to explain just what kind of mess he'd gotten himself into.\par
She promised she'd be there for him before sunset.\par
… She was honestly a saint.\par


\section{62. Rebirth in Flame }
\par
\par
Reina was true to her word. It took her just about three hours to get here, and she brought a team of trusted folk to help. He recognized Ethan, the burly bear-like man he’d dueled once, who nodded cheerfully to him.\par
It took a few more hours to free all the prisoners, set up temporary housing, and get meals going. She upgraded the Beacon to C-rank. She used it remake a chunk of land right in the heart of Portland, where most of the folk there could stay.\par
There were a couple thousand of them, and they looked like they’d crawled straight out of a prisoner-of-war camp. Most of them were scarcely over Level 20. When Reina looked at them she had this heartbroken look in her eyes. It seemed to spur her on.\par
By midnight or so, she'd gotten pretty much everyone housed and fed. There was much more work to do—she’d already started on the urban planning—but Zane convinced her to rest. It could wait for tomorrow. \par
Her attitude toward him was pretty much what he expected. She seemed pretty mad, which she understood. Usually she came off as determined with a take charge can-do attitude, but she was still kind about it, especially when she spoke to people. \par
When he tried talking to her at first, she brushed him off. She was brusque, cold, standoffish. Later, she answered in clipped sentences. She wouldn’t look him in the eyes. \par
When bedtime rolled around, she said he'd stay at the palace. And she'd stay with him. He thought she'd start grilling him as soon as the doors closed behind them.\par
It turned out he'd misread her.\par
Almost the instant the doors shut, she… showed that she was happier to see him than he’d thought. \par
He didn't get a lot of sleep that night.\par
They lay on Elliotts’ silk four-poster bed the next morning, sunlight filtering through the windows, warming them. There she confessed to him, murmuring softly, eyes closed, head pressed up tight against his chest. She'd been restraining herself earlier so she could get her job done. He'd hardly been gone, and somehow she’d already missed him—so much that she’d found it hard to think straight around him. \par
She kept murmuring. She said she felt safe around him. She knew he’d always be there for her, that she could always depend on him. He was something to hold onto, always stable—never despairing, never too high or too low. She said, in a happy, dream-drunk voice, that he felt like the earth under her feet, holding her up—always strong, even when she wasn't.\par
Zane found all this utterly baffling. He was pretty sure she didn't need him to feel all that—it was all in her head. As far as he could tell, he didn't do anything. He was just kind of… there? Late at night, every day, she'd come and confess her worries to him. All he did was listen and hold her. He was kind of like an emotional support animal, now that he thought about it. Her unusually large emotional support animal.\par
… he didn't mind it, honestly. It was kind of nice. \par
With everyone else, she was Reina the fearless leader. But with him, she melted—she let herself be vulnerable. He felt it was a privilege to see her like this. She trusted he would take care of her. Somehow, he knew he was the only one she trusted like this.\par
She had fallen back asleep, using him as a pillow. And he just watched her sleeping, the way her chest rose and fell gently, the warm brown curls of her hair splayed messily across his chest. She had a soft little smile on her face. She seemed like she was having a happy dream.\par
Zane had seen her face before, obviously. A lot. He’d had a certain thought the very first time he’d seen her, and somehow he kept having it. He was struck with it now. \par
She really was very, very pretty.\par
*** \par
Later that morning, he took out the Orb of Azeroth, found a quiet room in the palace, and sat. There, he gazed into its murky red depths. There were black clouds staining the red, slowly moving. In the same way you could find shapes in the clouds in the sky, he started finding shapes in these black clouds. His gaze grew soft, fell away, unfocused. And those black clouds, which had been mere impressions, grew more and more vivid…\par
He tried focusing on the Law of Fiery Rebirth. On Rebirth in Flame, the Skill he meant to learn.\par
A scene began to form.\par
He saw jagged black mountains staining the horizon. The ground was pitch black too, as far as you could see, and rivers snaked across it, splitting and winding a thousand different ways, flowing with pale blue fire—like the water itself was burning.\par
This wasn’t earth. \par
His gaze was drawn to a man standing in the midst of it all, clad in armor made of an odd blackness, a blackness so dark it seemed to absorb the light around it. The man's face was blue-black, gaunt as a skeleton. And twin blue flames burned where his eyes had been.\par
His skull-like face was frozen in a giant, permanent, horrifying grin.\par
Somehow, Zane got the sense this was the demon Azeroth.\par
Azeroth stared up at the sky. Then Zane looked up too, and had a moment of whiplash.\par
He saw stars in the sky. But nothing like the stars he knew—not tiny pinpricks but blown-up spheres. He saw planets with swirling brown clouds, bright blue planets laden with icy rings, dark red planets so close he could see the dust storms playing across their surface. The sky was alive with the stuff of space. But Azeroth was looking at none of those; Azeroth was looking at what seemed like a dust cloud in front of it all. The dust cloud drawing closer, growing bigger. Zane made it out.The author's content has been appropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\par
That was no cloud.\par
That was an army. An army of men with faces streaked in red war-paint. They wore flowing robes, spiked helms. In their hands were lances big enough to run an elephant all the way through, burning at the tips.\par
They rode on the backs of dragons. Dragons. Gold-scaled, black-scaled, red-scaled. Some small as canoes, some big as warships. Fire foamed at their snouts, burning with Laws that went straight over Zane’s head. \par
And Azeroth rose to greet them.\par
The demon leaped. An explosion blasted off the soles of his feet—Zane had a moment of vertigo. What was that? Azeroth did it again, like a rocket launcher blasting off, throwing him suddenly into the air. It was some sort of Skill. The Law of Eruption woven with something else, something Zane couldn't catch.\par
Now Zane’s defense was patched, movement was his greatest weakness. He’d always been slow and lumbering… he'd probably never be as fast as, say, Avery, or those with Laws made for speed. But he was getting a little embarrassed by how little he could dodge. If only he could get something like that…\par
He didn't recall seeing it in the Inheritance description, though. And when he tried to focus on it, there seemed to be a veil covering his senses, masking the Law. He frowned.\par
Right—wasn't he meant to be learning Rebirth in Flame? What was going on?\par
He turned his attention back up just as Azeroth splayed out his hands, and two monstrously large claws seething with ghostly flame burst into being. Like avatars of his clawed hands—the same shape, blown up to the size of small mountains.\par
Azeroth and the dragon army collided.\par
He raked out his hands, and dragons fell out of the sky. \par
They didn't seem burnt on the flesh. But the light in their eyes was snuffed out. Azeroth drew back for another swipe—\par
A river of dragonfire took him in the face. Skin melted, and muscle, then bone—\par
White fire blazed where the red one touched. \par
And Zane watched him burn in reverse. \par
Bone healed. Muscle strung it up. And flesh, new and whole, made the finish. It was like he’d never been burned at all. Rebirth in Flame! \par
That was almost instantaneous. So fast Zane would’ve missed it if he’d blinked. \par
So fast, Azeroth didn't even react to it. The demon laughed maniacally, and kept slashing. Each swipe ripped a chunk out of the army. A dragon-claw ripped off his arm—there was a flash of white flame, and a new one took its place. It was so ridiculously fast, it looked as though the dragon had torn off a fake toy arm, and Azeroth had his real one hidden up a sleeve, just ready to throw out in a flash.\par
Azeroth rocketed about, making a constellation of light in the bursting night sky, tearing through that dragon rider army. Everywhere he went, those huge, proud beasts were snuffed out. Their soulless bodies went limp, cratered into the ground.\par
The dragon riders were getting desperate. They're trying to crowd them up close, but they couldn't seem to do a thing to him. Azeroth kept laughing—\par
Something loomed up behind him, a dragon bigger and greater and angrier than all the rest, so big it eclipsed the sky. Its eyes were the size of Azeroth's whole body. Azeroth turned to face a mouth unhinging, so huge it eclipsed the world, like a night sky unfurling—and those shining teeth could’ve been a field of cruel stars.\par
Azeroth screamed, kicked away. The massive jaws clamped down.\par
Its teeth took off the demon's body from the chest down. And as Azeroth, scarcely more than a head now, fell spinning—\par
For half a second.\par
The world flashed white. A new body flared into being, and like that, the demon was whole again.\par
That fire healed so fast, it was like it turned back time.\par
Azeroth shrieked out a laugh and made a fist.\par
A giant ghostly fist smashed the dragon out of the sky…\par
The scene faded.\par
And then he was back in the palace foyer again, staring dumbly at the orb, soaked in sweat.\par
Skill learned! \par
Rebirth in Flame [Epic]\par
He was breathing heavily, and he hadn't even been fighting. \par
For a while he sat there staring dumbly, trying to understand what the Hell he’d just seen. Then he began to smile. \par
Every single time he saw a battle like this... a battle that threw his idea of what was possible out the window… It just got him so excited. God.\par
It should be him up there, battling it out amongst the stars. Scenes like this teased him painfully.\par
He sat there and tried dragging out a little more from the Orb—maybe a Minor Law or two? Maybe that soul defense Skill? But he could tell he was shot. He couldn't stop himself from trembling. No—no more comprehension for the day. He had to fight.\par
These Laws could wait for later. He had Steel Laws to comprehend too, from that B-ranked Treasure Elias gave him. He figured he could stack them—once he got his hands on some Law tTreasure, like the Law Fruit, he could do one intense session and mine them all out at once.\par
And where better to get rare treasures than a C-ranked Dungeon?\par
He set out for the Gorge.\par
*** \par
Once he was at the edge, he couldn't see the bottom. As he leaned over, peering into the murk, it was like he'd put his head into a wind tunnel—the howling was deafening.\par
Apparently he wasn’t even in the Dungeon yet. There was nothing on the mini-map. He had to go farther—he had to go in. \par
There could be a nest of Monsters down there, for all he knew. \par
He could probably jump from here and be fine in terms of fall damage. But just in case, he got out an Axe. He set it to about half its maximum length, which was very long, and dropped it straight into the murk. He waited.\par
Halfway down, the Chain started to tremble, like it was being heavily battered by a great many powerful things. At this length, the Chain was heavy as a cargo ship. Which made the vibrations he was feeling…\par
Interesting.\par
He didn't feel his Axe hit the ground.\par
Just how far down did this thing go?\par
He swung it into the wall. It caught something there, and held. He figured he could just keep swinging down until he hit something.\par
He would hit something, right? Surely.\par
Only one way to find out.\par
Time for his first C-rank dungeon. \par
He leaped into the dark. \par
You have entered: Dungeon: Gorge of the Elemental Winds (C)\par
\par

His mini-map changed. The dungeon was one shapeless block before. Now definition popped up. So did colors.\par
The Gorge was one long thin strip. It seemed to go on for miles. A chamber lay on either end. Zane guessed that was where the Bosses were. He caught it fleetingly.\par
Most of his attention was on the middle—where he was.\par
It was lit up red. All of it. He couldn't see anything else.\par
He blinked. Uh…\par
Storm gales scythed past him, watering his eyes. He squinted into the murk, trying to find the Monsters. He couldn't hear over that all that howling. It was so dark he couldn't see either—they were little flashes of light far below, like vivid yellow fireflies scattered down the length of the Gorge.\par
He plummeted after his Axe. Soon it came into view, sunk into a cleft in the stone. It was the one spot of light burning up the dark.\par
He was close enough now he could barely make out the shapes whipping past it—\par
Galefeather Crow (Monster)\par
Essence Level 58\par
Galefeather Crow (Monster)\par
Essence Level 63\par
Galefeather Crow (Monster)\par
Essence Level 66\par
Dozens of boxes shot up at once.\par
63? 66? And there were that many of them?\par
He saw a flash of light again, much closer now—like a bolt of lightning shooting through the dark. Something was moving.\par
Lightning Spirit (Monster)\par
Essence Level 67\par
In that brief electric flash he caught a snapshot of where he was plummeting.\par
Sleek dark things with feathers gleaming slick like living metal. There were too many to count; they flooded the Gorge, a storm-cloud of razor-sharp feathers. Lightning danced through them—\par
Oh, boy. Zane had a bad feeling about this.\par
He tried throwing out another Chain, but it was too late to stop. He was going too fast. He hurtled toward them like a meteor.\par
He gritted his teeth.\par
If he thought it was loud before… he gave up on hearing. The shrieking got so loud he swore his ears were bleeding.\par
They collided.\par
He tore through the first layer by sheer momentum.\par
Then the rest of them were on him.\par
Lines of hot pain ripped up his arms, his legs, his midsection, everywhere. He hadn't known it was possible to feel pain in so many places, all at once—like he'd barreled through the world's sharpest thorn bush. He squeezed his eyes shut.\par
They'd used some kind of Skill. It ripped right past his skin, found the muscle—and the Major Law of Steel packed tight there. There was some kind of Law in the slashes. Wind Laws? Whatever it was, it couldn't cut past him.\par
If he hadn't gotten Spirit Steel Body, that might've been bad. It still felt like his body was being put through a meat grinder. His pain tolerance was very high—it was a simple fact. And even he hissed at the feeling.\par
Rebirth in Flame!\par
Light flared to life. White, ghostly light threw out the dark as every single wound on him caught fire. He saw the nightmare that held him. Gleaming beaks and gleaming feathers and gleaming yellow eyes streaked past, so many they seemed to blend into each other, one huge streaming mass of piercing pain. He poured all his essence into his Skill, tried desperately to hold on; it was all he could do as he fell. They just kept coming, opening up tear after tear, but with Rebirth in Flame, he could hold off the damage—sort of. Just barely.\par
It hurt like hell, but as long as he didn't bleed out—\par
Lightning flashed again, blinding him. Something foreign struck him, and he spasmed. He felt it tear right through his skin, his muscles, his bone—his Steel Laws tried to resist, but they did very little. These new laws—Lightning Laws? They struck him to his very core.\par
A Lightning Spirit hovered before him, a little sprite of sizzling light; he saw its cruel white grin.\par
Warning! Health under 75\%!\par
Jerking up a shuddering arm, Zane traced a line. It came out jagged. But it still rushed out.\par
Rising Sun Slash!\par
And that smiling face was cut in half. Its last expression was shock. The Slash went past; it found body after body after body—\par
Skill Up!\par
Rising Sun Slash II -> III Unauthorized duplication: this narrative has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\par
He didn't have time to register it. He fell through, still flailing—but the pain stopped, the howling thinned a little. He tried throwing his other Axe, getting another grip on the wall, managed to lodge it a foot deep—\par
—and hit the ground at last.\par
The problem was, he did so face-first. At just about terminal velocity.\par
That was enough force to kill pretty much everyone he knew.\par
For Zane, it just broke his face. Pretty much everything in it.\par
Zane groaned.\par
***\par
It spoke to his new durability that his Health didn't even drop past 50\%.\par
It still hurt about as much as before, though.\par
Once the White Flames cleared from his face, Zane stumbled to his feet. He looked up. You could still see those crackling electric lights bobbing high above. The howling was still deafening. But it seemed he was past it the worst of it. At least for now, they didn't follow. They stayed up there in a brutal fake-cloud layer.\par
They were all Level 50s and 60s. The same Levels as bosses in a D-ranked dungeon. He shook his head, letting out a tight breath.\par
These C-ranked dungeons were different.\par
He tried to take stock of everything—he was still feeling pretty disoriented. Right. He'd just gotten a Skill up on Rising Sun Slash. That was kind of random. He'd been using it a lot lately. He guessed that pushed it over the edge?\par
He let out a tight breath and checked out his surroundings. Bare, craggy black walls. Bare, craggy black ground. The only thing that broke it up were the bones, littered here and there...\par
He pursed his lips. If he'd had a rough time coming down, and he was a World Ranker… no one normal was surviving that.\par
For the first time in a long time, he was alone. He'd have to clear this solo.\par
It was… kind of exhilarating, actually. He smiled. He was looking forward to the challenge.\par
What now?\par
He was alive. He supposed he could try for one of the bosses…\par
Before then, though… he scratched his chin, looking up.\par
Hmm.\par
He thought back to his Skill Up. Every time he Leveled a Skill, he noticed a significant difference. Inferno Cyclone, for instance, was a monstrous Skill now. He wondered how strong Rising Sun Slash was at Tier 3. It was one of his two Epic Skills, after all.\par
The other was his new thing, Rebirth in Flame. The thing that might've saved him just now.\par
Use a Skill over and over, and you Leveled it up. That fight he'd seen Azaroth have still lingered in his mind. Would he get there if he just kept leveling Rebirth in Flame? … That'd be a useful thing to have, wouldn't it?\par
Eventually, could he regenerate whole limbs too? It was always his Health that ran out first, never his essence. If he could convert one into the other…\par
He scratched his head. Essence wasn't tracked by the system, just like soul power. It felt like a weird oversight. But just from observing things, it seemed Mages and their subclasses had the biggest pools. Warriors had the smallest. It was balanced—for Warriors, a lot of the essence they got went into their bodies in the form of Stats. Mages kept more of it raw for use in spells.\par
Zane had heard his own Warriors complaining about running thin on essence… though he'd never had that issue. Maybe it was because of his Signature Title, or his Class…?\par
Oh, look. He blinked. They were coming for him. A lesser darkness had broken off from the greater one above. A tight pack, thirty or forty of those Crows, flanked by a Lightning Spirit. They screeched bloody murder at him as they got close. He checked one out.\par
Galefeather Crow (Monster)\par
Essence Level 62\par
Law: Minor Law of Piercing Gales (Elemental Law of Wind) \par
Key Skills:\par
Feather Hail [Rare]: Launches razor-sharp feathers infused with wind-Laws, sure to shear through flesh and muscle.\par
He got out his Axes and slashed as they came close. Rising Sun Slash!\par
It shot out a lot faster and brighter than before, burning like a solar flare; it ripped right through a row of them like they were tissue paper.\par
He thought it was a neat upgrade. But the problem was, his Slashes were thin.\par
The rest just kept coming.\par
He threw up another Slash, downed another line of them, but he realized he was using the wrong tool. This called for Inferno Cyclone.\par
He managed one last Slash—splitting that Lightning Spirit in half, the only thing that posed any kind of threat to him. Then the flock was on him.\par
A hail of blisteringly sharp carved into him, studded the ground around him, scoring deep wounds into the dense black dirt. They got several feet into the ground. They got hardly an inch into the skin.\par
Still hurt far more than they should've.\par
Then came another wave. And another. They started circling him in a rippling dark whirlpool, surrounding him, blotting out the world in swirling huge black feathers, slashing at him, loosing glass-shattering screeches at him—it was quite a performance.\par
They shredded him in seconds.\par
But they were mostly annoying. They were little more than paper cuts. They could rupture his skin, but they couldn't get far past. A little Rebirth in Flame, and he was good.\par
He was just about to get rolling with an Inferno Cyclone when he had a sudden thought.\par
…Let me try something.\par
He just stood there.\par
He let them tear into him. Soon they were mauling him with fervor. The feathers just kept coming. They seemed endless. He was caught in a storm of endless cuts. His body was torn up all over, hundreds and hundreds of times. Blood dripped from every inch of his skin.\par
And hundreds and hundreds of times, Rebirth in Flame activated. Little ghostly fires burned everywhere. Over and over and over.\par
You Leveled up Skills from repeated practice, right?\par
He grinned.\par
This was kind of neat, actually. His body was getting to the point actually wounding him was weirdly inconvenient. He was thinking of training Rebirth in Flame by repeatedly tossing himself off a mountain. But this was much easier.\par
A few minutes passed like this. He must have been cut thousands of times. The Monsters were getting angry. They threw harder and harder—to no avail. Phantom pains laced his arms, his legs, his belly; his skin was shredded and remade and shredded again… but soon—\par
Skill Up!\par
His smile widened for a second before he read the rest.\par
Spirit Steel Body I -> II\par
Eh. He'd take it.\par
This was kind of like an ice bath, or a sauna, back in the olden days. Just rinsing himself in temporary discomfort. But it was good for him. It sounded a little nuts, but he was kind of liking the feeling of getting mauled now. Some part of his brain started treating it as progress.\par
Then he saw the red on his mini-map start to shift. He squinted up.\par
… It seemed he was attracting attention. The swarm was taking notice… was he about to get swamped? That great storm cloud was heaving, bowing inward… Oh dear.\par
Seems like it.\par
He pulled up his Axes. It was a little hard to see, what with all the giant bird bodies flashing everywhere, slicing the shit out of him, but he could barely make out the wall on either side. He wiped some blood out of his eyes—yes. There was barely enough room if he kept the Chains really short. Ten feet to either side. More tornado than Cyclone.\par
He started to spin. Sparks flashed. And like a great beast rousing from a long slumber, the Cyclone burst into being.\par
And thousands of Monsters funneled down to meet him. Thousands of Monsters, in the Level 50s and 60s… just how much essence was that?\par
His first revolution crushed the Crows that'd been doing such a good job of shredding him. They went down shrieking, bursting into flame and little fireballs, crisping to ash. He kept on turning. Second revolution. Third…\par
By the fourth revolution, the first wave of Monsters was almost on him. But by then a new wind had howled into the Gorge, revolving against the old one.\par
The old wind was sharp. The new wind had the Major Law of Absolute Sharpness.\par
The old wind was fierce. The new wind was loaded with the Major Law of Scorched Wrath.\par
The old wind was made by thousands of monsters blasting at once.\par
The new wind was made by Zane Walker.\par
The old touched down… and crushed the new. Black wind drowned out the red.\par
Zane drowned under an avalanche of feathers.\par
And this time they cut past the skin. They tore through the muscle. He was cut so many times, so many thousands of times, the sheer weight of it was enough—there were just too many. He was drowning. It got through his Spirit Steel Body. It cut to the bone.\par
Warning: Health under 75\%!\par
For an instant it felt utterly overwhelming.\par
But he didn't stop his revolutions.\par
He bit down hard, gritted his teeth and forced his way through. He was burning white all over, but it wasn't enough. His Health ratcheted down, shot back up, swooped back down again—\par
Fifth revolution.\par
Zane screamed, heart running wild in his shredded chest, blood running hot even as it gushed out of him. He poured in everything he had.\par
Sixth.\par
A swirl of red clawed its way out from under that towering tornado of black.\par
And it fought back.\par


\section{64. Storm of Feathers (II) }
\par
The tornado tore down the Gorge, one terrible black tower of Monster flesh. Utterly crushing. \par
Then it stilled. Shivered. \par
And, at its very bottom, flickered red. \par
The red started to thicken—a brilliant current turning against the black. They corkscrewed furiously, running against each other.\par
For a moment they held there, deadlocked. \par
Then the red blazed bright. It shoved. And the blackness could only give way.\par
 Red tore into black, and black unwound. It was a very violent thing. It unwound not just the tornado, but what made it. It unwound flesh and bone. Shrieks poured down the Cyclone. \par
The black started catching fire. \par
Seventh revolution.\par
Warning! Health under 50\%\par
Savage body activated! \par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Zane was on one knee. He could barely keep himself upright. He kept himself moving by sheer will—but luckily unlike Health or essence, he never worried about that. He always seemed to have more in him. \par
He spun into an eighth revolution. Now the red spread in earnest. It started feasting on the black. There was a new sound, the sound of raging fire, the sound of burning, a deep-throated roaring that drowned out the wind’s shrieking.\par
The Monsters tried taking him down all at once; they must be getting nervous. They could tell something was wrong. Suddenly they threw everything. They tried chucking lightning at him, tried pouring down their arrow-like feathers. Most of it went up in flames as they came down the chute. Feathers smoldered to smoke. Lightning roasted mid-air. A scattering still got through, thwip-thwip-thwipping by, searing hot lines into his skin. \par
Ghostly white fires flickered where they’d struck.\par
Skill up!\par
Rebirth in Flame I -> II\par
He grinned bloody teeth.\par
He'd been in here what, ten minutes? Twenty? And he’d already collected three Skill Levels. \par
He was up to the tenth revolution now.\par
Now things were getting dangerous. For them, that was. \par
The nasty thing about fire was, the bigger it was, the faster it burned, the harder it was to stop. Zane's Cyclone started swallowing. It was a shining red-yellow serpent rising out of the ground, gulping down rows and rows of fowl, feasting on them, roasting them whole. So much essence flooded him he hardly knew what to do with it.\par
It kept feeding his healing. And once he was fully healed it started pouring into Levels. It felt like he was drinking a strong Essence Vial—just a glut of dense essence pouring in all at once.\par
He felt it swelling, reaching a critical point—\par
A sudden warmth spread through him, euphoric. \par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 78 -> 79\par
The fires had climbed halfway up the Cyclone now, and there was no stopping them. Like watching a wildfire tear through a forest. Barely any attacks got through to him now. The ones that did struck like ghosts. They cut him, but by the time you looked down to see them, he only saw the aftermath—the ghostly white flames flickering away. The skin underneath was perfectly smooth.\par
Rebirth in Flame, Tier II, wiped them away like dust.\par
By then, a deep crackling, a fiery roaring claimed the Gorge; the shrieking of the winds, the shrieking of the Crows, just couldn't compete. Zane saw a few Crows crying out, flapping away, breaking free of the mass. They hardly got out before the Cyclone dragged them back. They burned like the rest of them. \par
He saw clumps of red dots drifting closer on his mini-map, on either side. At first he thought it was other Crows coming to help.\par
Then he realized his winds had gotten so fierce they yanked the whole Monster stream into their orbit.\par
When they came through, they roasted instantly. There was a little explosion at first—when the dark streams touched the edge of the Cyclone, and his greedy fires found new flesh to devour. Little explosions on either side over and over, as whole flocks were dragged in. They flapped uselessly. They threw Skill after Skill. The Lightning Spirits blew out jagged bright-yellow trees, hitting nothing.\par
None of their powers could stand with him. \par
When he first dropped through here, he felt like he was being thrown into a meat grinder. He was the meat grinder now. He wasted them. \par
The redness on his mini-map started to thin. The darkness in his vision thinned too. You could actually see down the Gorge now, all the way up to the top, running forward to either side, all lit up, raging, flickering yellow-red in the light of the Cyclone. Reflecting the radiance of his power.\par
Then the Cyclone hit the top, and ran out of bodies.\par
It reigned dominant, the sole wind of the Gorge, and its triumphant roar rushed down its length. \par
Zane watched his mini-map. A river of Monster red was a trickle. Now just a splash of it, little dots, little droplets—\par
And nothing.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 79 -> 80Stolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.\par
He dropped the Cyclone.\par
Towers of fire raced out to either end in one last triumph. Then they burned out too, and the Gorge went dark.\par
There was an eerie silence. \par
Zane looked up. The walls were...blue, oddly. He looked up farther, and saw why.\par
That was the color of the sky. Seen from this deep down, The sky seemed a bright blue river carved onto the surface of the world. Surreal.\par
Where there was once an army of Monsters, now there was just him. Him, breathing heavy, heaving, this stupid smile on his face. That was the end of it.\par
He'd gotten two Skill Levels out of it but only two essence Levels. That was still a lot of essence. That was the essence of thousands of high-Level Monsters pouring into him at once.\par
He was simply getting to the point where each new Level cost an insane amount of essence.\par
At least he'd hit Level 80. Nice round number. He wondered what World Ranking that was… he’d have to check when he got out. \par
***\par
Right. Time for the Bosses. He picked an end at random and set out for it. \par
On the way, he found a chest buried in the wall, its top sticking out. A stone chest secured with thick steel latches. Zane opened it.\par
The inside was pretty similar to other treasure chests he’d seen, just fancier. All plush velvet cushions for this treasure. It was a veil, studded with little gems. Like a pale sky dusted with stars. \par
Dreamweaver Veil (C)\par
Wear the veil, and you shall dream of Law. In dreams you shall see the world like you never could waking, and you shall know its secrets. Uses remaining: 3 \par
Zane pocketed it happily. If it had just a few uses left, he'd make the best of it. Last time, he’d figured out Law Fruit stacked. He figured he'd get a few more Law treasures to pair with this, and take them all at once.\par
These treasure chests seemed to be the ‘default Treasure Area’ the system spawned. He found at least one in pretty much every dungeon he'd been to, not to mention the dungeon chest that spawned at the end. Usually there was at least one other Treasure Area per floor, though.\par
He kept walking and didn't find anything. Usually this meant it was in the Boss lair.\par
And sure enough—he got to the end of the Gorge, which opened up into a wider circular chamber. His mini-map came into range. There, overlapping with a fat red dot, were a host of fat yellow dots all bunched together.\par
Smaller red dots dotted the chamber’s edges. Probably either Lightning Spirits or Crows. One per Boss. \par
He gave it a little think, scratched his head. Admittedly, forethought was not his strong suit—he usually preferred to get into the thick of things. He had a knack for finding a way through once he was knee-deep. But he'd found out just as he was strong against Wind, he was pretty weak against Lightning. It made sense, actually. Steel conducted electricity, didn't it?\par
If those dots were Lightning Spirits and they blasted him as soon as he stepped in…\par
It could be a rough time. He could imagine a scene where they tased him before he even got going, and he just lay there, spasming the whole fight.  \par
Maybe he could take a page out of Reina’s book.\par
He got out his Axes early, before he even stepped into the lair.\par
With a spin he got his Cyclone sparking again. The second revolution, the third, and the fire roared back to life. Flames licked the Gorge walls, casting it bright yellow-red. He kept going. \par
Around the eight revolution, he thought, good enough!\par
He waded into the lair.\par
He couldn't even see what he was getting into, really—most of his vision was swamped with fire. He did hear the shrieking, though. Not electric-white but feather-black— this wasn't the lightning spirit side after all. This side seemed just Crows.\par
They tried getting at him. \par
They couldn’t come anywhere close. They roasted like paper dolls in an incinerator. They poured in again and again… nothing. \par
He was starting to regret coming in this heavy. Against Crows, this was way overkill. In ten seconds, the red dots on his mini-map had nearly vanished. Where was the Boss?\par
Then he saw a fat red dot break out of the clump of small red ones. Right on top of him. He looked up.\par
At first he’d thought it was a swarm of Crows bunched in close. Then it unfurled its wings and screeched, and he realized—no. That was just a Crow as big as a house. Its plumage shifted as it flapped, like a roiling thunderstorm. It screeched; it sounded like dozens of Crows trapped in one massive throat. \par
Galefeather Raven (Monster)\par
Essence Level 74\par
Law: Major Law of Turbulent Winds (Elemental Law of Wind) \par
   \par
Soul of the Storm (Passive) [Rare]: Generates a perpetual storm aura. This aura creates erratic gusts and mini-cyclones, breaking enemy strikes and empowering its own. \par
Hurricane Dive (Active) [Rare]: Soars high, then dives at lightning speed wrapped in storm-strength winds. Its force is akin to a hurricane making landfall. \par
Its weaknesses were the joints and its wings, and right around its neck. It seemed to be holding off his Cyclone just fine. Must be that Soul of the Storm. It was like it had its own little wind force-field. \par
The wings closed in suddenly, folded into a sleek form, like a torpedo. It dropped straight over him. This must be that Hurricane Dive. He readied himself. He figured he had to time it just right—\par
Pain exploded up his midsection. A massive force blasted through him. He hit a wall, crumpled to the floor, gasping.\par
He blinked. There seemed to be a gaping hole in his midsection. \par
When he looked up, he found the culprit. The Raven’s beak was stained dark red.\par
That thing just hit him so fast it was like it’d teleported.\par
His Cyclone sputtered out. \par
…and he’d worked so hard on it too. He felt a little miffed. \par
Now that the flames cleared, he finally saw where he was. A natural stone amphitheater ringed by towering craggy cliffs. Halfway up the rock face—where he’d seen all those yellow dots—was a nest. \par
Those he could get later. For now, this Raven. His belly ached, but Rebirth in Flame was already patching up the muscle. He was having a hard time respecting the thing—it couldn’t even get through his abs. In fairness he was probably just a bad matchup for it. \par
It folded for another dive. This time he tossed his Chains right in front of him. Just this tangled black steel mass. There was a rush of air; he heard a CLANG!, a howl. A whip of black, and the thing had rushed off. There was a new dent in its beak. He grinned, and went chasing after it. He chucked an Axe after it, and another. Rising Sun Slash! \par
He missed. \par
…He missed again. \par
He kept on missing for about five minutes. The thing flew circles around him—it felt kind of like trying to swat a fly in the old days. A very big, sharp fly. \par
He tried setting up another Cyclone to draw it in, and was rewarded with a new hole in his belly. He tried waiting for it to dive, then timing it, and after collecting three more holes in his belly—it really liked his belly, for some reason—he was made to realize he was slower than he thought. It could hit him and get out of the way faster than he could swing his Axe, apparently. \par
It was starting to get embarrassing. He was just glad Avery wasn’t here to see him running around like a buffoon, swatting at air. He really had to work on his speed. This was ridiculous. \par
He tried setting up a fake Cyclone and faking it out. It did not work. The thing was somehow wise to it. He tried switching to his old Chains, setting them extremely long, throwing them all up to try to tangle it. That did not work either. \par
He tried climbing up to the nest, and found some massive speckled eggs nestled there, among other treasures. He put an Axe over the top of one, threatening to crush it. The thing looked him dead in the eyes, like it was daring him to do it. It seemed unreasonably smug. \par
“…” \par
In the end he just waited for it to start diving, then chucked out his Axe. He figured he had a lot of tries at it. It wasn’t like it was going to kill him anytime soon. \par
 He mistimed it twelve times. Then, on the thirteenth, he took its head off its shoulders. \par
Not his proudest victory, but he’d take it. Was it luck? He preferred to think of it as ‘playing the odds.’ \par
…He was extra glad Avery wasn’t here. She would’ve laughed at him for a week straight, probably.\par
Ah, well. He went to check out his new treasures. \par
\par


\section{65. Thunderdome (I) }
\par
Eggs were most of it. Giant eggs speckled with black dots, glowing with a creamy inner light. He inspected them.\par
Galefeather Raven Eggs (C)\par
These eggs contain the Natal essence of the Galefeather Raven, King of the gale-crows. Exceptionally rich. If left untouched, this egg will spawn a new Boss.\par
That was one of the least pleasant Boss fights Zane could remember having. He was definitely leaving these touched.\par
He'd been hurt far worse in past fights. That wasn't how he judged pleasantness, though. Those had been fights. This had been… he wasn't even sure. It was more running than fighting. It got him all eager, ready to give it his all, then let him give almost none of it.\par
He was still hot, simmering with pent-up battle rage. Splitting that Raven had been nowhere near satisfying enough. It was almost accidental.\par
He sighed.\par
He put a hand to an egg and felt the essence simmering within. Nothing held it. Nothing lived in the egg yet. It was easy to draw out into himself, up his arm, dispersing through his body in tendrils of cozy heat. It felt like downing a high-ranked essence elixir.\par
A few minutes later, the glow went out of the egg. He moved on to the next one. In the next. And the next still. There were seven in total, and on the fifth—\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 81 -> 82\par
He took some petty satisfaction in draining the last of them. Speed-type Monsters. He wrinkled his nose.\par
He scoured the nest and found a crystal big as his palm. A ball of sizzling light was trapped in the middle of it.\par
Stormheart Crystal (C)\par
Condensed in the heart of a Storm, this treasure has seen untold lightning strikes and knows their secrets. It holds within it fragments of the Elemental Law of Electricity.\par
Pretty neat. Kind of like that Volcanic Heart treasure he picked up back in Mount Saint Helens.\par
He also found a juicy-looking white fruit with an electric-blue stem.\par
Lightning Law Fruit (C)\par
Magnifies one's insights into the Laws of the Electricity. Effective until Elemental.\par
He was hoping for something he could use in his upcoming Law binge. He'd get in a Major Law of Fire and probably one of Steel. But it wasn't like he had any skills to do with Electricity…\par
Maybe he could start learning. Maybe Electricity Laws might add to his Rising Sun Slash? He wasn't sure how fire and lightning played off each other. Maybe he'd find out.\par
***\par
He made for the other Boss.\par
On the way, he found a Treasure Area—a little cavern built into the wall, sizzling with electricity. He felt it tingling his skin as he walked in. Its walls were pale stone webbed with electric-blue cracks.\par
Grounding Chamber (C)\par
The dispersed powers of lightning that flood the ground go here. The shocks here temper the body and leave essence behind. Those who can bear its flow stand to reap great essence benefits.\par
Zane grunted. For a second, his whole body locked up. A shock cracked through him, then another; he took another step. The shocks got more intense as he drew closer.\par
It seemed to be a similar class of treasure to the Lava Falls in Saint Helens. Kind of a painful essence geyser. Useful to boost up Luminous Faction warriors, maybe—those who could take it, anyway. He tried walking around a bit, but it was soon clear at his Level, the thing was too slow. He was better off killing things.\par
He'd let Reina know, though.\par
He approached the lair of the next Boss cautiously. It was called the Thunderous Beast, which could be anything. This one should have Lightning Spirit minions. Zane just hoped it wasn't another speed type, or he could be in for a very annoying time.\par
He went in with the same setup as before. Inferno Cyclone to start with. He stoked it to a raging flame. Then he waded down the Gorge, straight into the Beast's lair.\par
The plan worked. His Cyclone raged into the chamber, swept up all the red dots, and snuffed them out in seconds. The Spirits hardly managed to singe him; he saw them shrieking at him, saw their mouths open in shock as they burned. It kind of amused him. Lighting Spirits in shock.\par
Then it was just Zane and the Boss, and he let the Skill drop.\par
He stood in the cavern, the walls of white stone crackling blue light like they were charged up with electricity. And at its center—\par
Thunderous Beast (Monster)\par
Essence Level 76\par
Law: Major Law of DischargeStolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\par
Key Skills\par
Horn Charge (Active) [Rare]\par
The Thunderous Beast charges lightning and charges the enemy, its horn crackling with punishing electric energy. It discharges on contact, immobilizing and devastating the enemy.\par
Static Shield (Passive) [Rare]\par
Envelops the body in a swirling vortex of static electricity. Deters foes and repels projectiles, making the Beast an electric powerhouse.\par
Zane was relieved to find it was not a bird. It didn't look very fast at all—it looked chunky and bulky, with a horn shooting out of its blocky face. Like some kind of rhino. The bulk of it was tempest-gray, but its horn was white, the color of a lightning strike.\par
It did look pretty angry, though. Its massive feet were dug deep into the ground—probably to resist his Cyclone winds. Now they started glowing—was that the Law of Discharge? Zane watched, fascinated.\par
Then it bellowed and rushed him, horn blaring crackling white light.\par
Zane—as had been quite painfully established—was slow.\par
But it took longer for a several-ton giant Monster to charge the length of a football field toward him than it took for Zane to draw a line with his arm.\par
… Though it was a little depressing how close it was. The Beast got within ten feet of Zane before his Rising Sun Slash carved it up the face. Zane's flaming Axe struck the sizzling horn. An explosion rocked the air; howling, the Beast was thrown off-course. It nearly fell over. It had to stumble to avoid ramming into the wall.\par
Growling, shaking its head as though to clear it, it looped for another go. Zane had messed up its face worse than he thought. Everything under the horn was split pretty clean down the middle, halfway to its neck. Slabs of skin hung loose. Strings of black blood poured out.\par
It made sense. He had six Levels on this thing, a handful of Laws, and some Epic Skills. He felt kind of bad for it. This wasn't really fair, was it? Like a gentleman, it was actually making an effort to fight him. Unlike that bird.\par
He was still pissed at the bird.\par
So he stowed his axe and swapped over to his Chains. He'd pay this Beast back—he'd give it a good fight.\par
Bellowing, it charged him.\par
And bellowing back, Zane charged it too.\par
That horn dipped down, angling to gore him through the chest. If it connected it'd mess him up pretty bad.\par
So he didn't let it. He chucked out a Chain, catching it. The power crashed through the steel, rippled down the length of it, and gave Zane a nasty jolt. He felt muscles seizing up all over his arms and chest. But he'd blunted the bulk of it.\par
Then Zane and the Beast collided like two fighting bulls.\par
Zane felt like he'd been hit by a semi-truck. The jolt was so vicious it made him see double for a second.\par
He saw the heaving masses of muscle rippling under the Beast's thick skin. He felt it snorting, roaring, saw its muscles bunching, straining harder. That massive body, every fiber of it, labored to crush Zane into the ground.\par
But Zane's body did the very same.\par
Every single muscle in his body sang with the glorious strain of it, from his thighs to his chest to his back; he burned. He felt the fight in his flesh, in his soul, and grinned viciously.\par
They were two great machines of flesh then, interlocked, straining mightily, neither giving an inch.\par
Then Zane planted a foot forward and shoved…\par
And the Beast fell back. One step. Then another, its massive feet digging furrows into the ground.\par
The Beast tried desperately. It couldn't hold ground. Each step rattled the earth. The Beast stared at him. Zane met its beady little eyes and saw its pupils shrink with shock.\par
Zane roared; his grin widened. Veins bulged on his neck.\par
This. This was a fight!\par
Step by step, trembling with the effort, Zane beat it back. He felt it as he looked in that Monster's eyes and saw the shock. As a human a quarter its size forced it slowly but surely to its knees. As this mere human took the fight to where it was strongest—and dominated it.\par
As Zane wrestled the Beast to the ground, he looped a Chain around its throat. And he tightened it.\par
It shot reams of lightning through the chains; lightning wreaked havoc on Zane's body. He didn't care. He kept pushing, he kept tightening. His Chains were a pure, beautiful expression of his power, and all the Beast could do now was flail, and gasp, and shudder.\par
Health Warning!\par
Health under 75\%\par
As far as Zane was concerned, this was the right way to fight. Looking your enemy dead in the eye as you threw out your very best effort. Setting your spirit against theirs, and striving and winning. None of this nonsense, running around and pot-shotting.\par
The Thunderous Beast slumped.\par
The Thunderous Beast has been slain!\par
Clearance objectives 2/2\par
Zane let out a long, slow sigh. After that, he felt cleansed. He felt good again.\par
… Now that the battle fervor was slowly trickling out of him, he felt like he was waking from a great dream. He felt proud, and hugely joyful, but also a smidge embarrassed. He'd just gone and wrestled a rhino for no reason other than he wanted to, really.\par
…He was very glad Avery was not here.\par
The Thunderous Beast's lair had a fat chest near the back, and Zane looted it before he moved on. Most of the offerings were essence stones. He found another Lightning Law Fruit—lots of Lightning-themed stuff here.\par
Then there were a set of two scrolls engraved silver at the ends, electric blue in the middle. He inspected them.\par
The first—\par
Thunderclaw Manuscript (C)\par
This Skill Scroll contains the Rare Skill 'Claw,' an immobilizing Claw Technique. Crafted by Elder Yu of the Black Bolt Faction, after a deep study of the defensive habits of the Goldlight Pangolin.\par
Prerequisite: 1 Major Laws of the Elemental Law of Electricity\par
Neat, but he didn't use claws. Maybe he could give it to Reina. Have her pawn it off at the Beacon shop.\par
Thunderfoot Manuscript (C)\par
This Skill Scroll contains the Rare Skill' Volt Blitz,' an explosive stomping Technique. Crafted by Elder Yu of the Black Bolt Faction, after a meticulous decade-long study of the movement style of the Thunderfoot Zebra.\par
Prerequisite: 2 Minor Laws of the Elemental Law of Electricity\par
Now this… this was interesting.\par
And he had just been miffed by how slow he was, too. This could certainly help. The only problem was he had no Electricity Laws… but with this environment and those Law Fruits, that was a pretty easy fix.\par
He scratched his chin.\par
He figured there was a pretty good chance the second floor would have some sort of Electric Law comprehension place. Either that or Wind Law, judging by what he'd seen of these dungeons. Maybe it'd be worth stacking a Lightning Law Fruit or two and sitting down for a few hours before he went to the next Boss?\par
A rugged stone staircase opened up around the middle of the Gorge, sank deep into the wall. Torches lit the way. He started down into the depths.\par
***\par
After a while—lots of spiraling in the dark—the stone staircase opened up into another Gorge. Just underground this time.\par
The second floor was one straight Gorge. It ran from the edge of the staircase straight down into a chamber. Where the Boss, the Thunder Roc, had to be.\par
Thunder Roc….\par
Weren't Rocs… birds?\par
Zane had a sinking feeling.\par
The walls were a jagged stone blacker than coal, webbed with electric-yellow lines that pulsed faintly. Zane saw clusters of red dotting the length of it on his mini-map. He looked up.\par
Perched on the high cliffs, peering down at him, were creatures with spiky yellow plumages crackling with electricity. Their beaks were thin and long, like lances.\par
Stormtalon (Monster)\par
Essence Level 63\par
He watched one flicker down the length of the Gorge in two flaps, like a flash of lightning.\par
…God damnit.\par


\section{66. Thunderdome (II) }
\par
The instant Zane stepped out of the stairwell, they were on him.\par
Stormtalon (Monster)\par
Essence Level 52\par
Laws:\par
Minor Law of Spark (Elemental Law of Electricity)\par
Key Skills:\par
Wing of Lightning (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Each beat of the wings spawns a lightning bolt, wounding and stunning the enemy.\par
They swooped in low, cawing, whipping out their wings. Spears of light stabbed him so fast he couldn't even block. It was like getting a flashlight shone in his eyes, but much more painful. He hissed as the shocks rippled through him.\par
He slashed, slashed again, tried shooting out an Axe. He knew it was useless. The stupid things just flickered away, cawing loudly. He sighed.\par
Grunting, he kept making his way down the gorge. They swooped back around, started stinging him again from behind. He threw up a few Slashes. He didn’t know why he even bothered. He was just too slow.\par
Fuck it.\par
He started up a Cyclone. He’d do it brute-force if he had to. One revolution, two—\par
He hissed. A glut of lightning struck him all at once, and for just half a second he went still, spasming. He lost the Cyclone. A herd of Stormtalons drifted overhead, laughing at him.\par
They couldn't hurt him, or even paralyze him for long. Just pester him. What kind of dumb fight was this?\par
God, he hated birds.\par
It wasn’t even that they pestered him, though that certainly didn’t help. They kept teasing him with a real fight. Then not engaging! They got him all hyped up for nothing.\par
Fine. He’d just ignored them, then. He resigned himself to getting pot-shotted. It wasn't like they could do much. They were like the Ravens and Lightning Spirits mixed in one very annoying package.\par
He felt them swooping overhead, zapping at him, flitting away. They kept screwing with him as he marched.\par
He couldn't wait to get this over with. He'd been here hardly five minutes and he was already done with his floor.\par
There was a Treasure Area up ahead, sticking out this side of the wall. As he drew closer, he saw it was a cave mouth—\par
Cavern of Insight (C)\par
Sanctum of the Thunder Oracle\par
The Thunder Oracle, a millennia-old obelisk, lies at the heart of this Cavern of Insight. It casts a field of Electric Law, enriching all those in its presence. A haven for those who seek the secrets of Lightning.\par
Zane peered in, scratching his head. Its steel walls ran with pulsing electric-yellow veins.\par
He looked back at those stupid birds, then at the Cavern again.\par
Hmm.\par
He strode on in. Eventually the tunnel it opened up into a Chamber. There was a monument at the center of it—a rod of steel scribed over with glowing runes. This must be the ‘obelisk.’ You could see the density of the Electric Laws running off it before you felt it—it trembled the air around it.\par
Interestingly, there was some kind of Steel Law at work too, twining with the Electric Law. He felt an overlap. It made sense. One conducted the other, right?\par
Now that he thought about it... lightning strikes released energy. Same with fire. Lightning caused fires, right? There was some kind of natural connection between all three of them, he felt. He scratched his chin. Making that connection was a little beyond him right now, though. Right now he could only feel the vague shape of it.\par
He let the thought sit for now.\par
He had two choices. He could go out there and take his chances with the Thunder Roc. He had a sinking feeling it'd be even more annoying than that Raven, which was saying something.\par
Or.\par
He pulled the Thunderfoot Scroll from his Bag of Holding.\par
Hmm.\par
Originally, he'd thought he'd get a movement Skill like that demon Azeroth’s. Made from Fire—some kind of rocket-launcher type Skill.\par
But this would do just fine.\par
He was going to save all his Law stuff for one big binge, too. But maybe he could make an exception.\par
Let's even the odds.\par
He took out the two Lightning Law Fruit he'd got and downed them in four big bites. A cozy warmth washed through him…\par
He checked out the Scroll.\par
This Skill Scroll contains the Rare Skill 'Volt Blitz,' an explosive stomping Technique. Crafted by Elder Yu of the Black Bolt Faction, after a meticulous decade-long study of the movement style of the Thunderfoot Zebra.If you spot this story on Amazon, know that it has been stolen.

Prerequisite: 2 Minor Laws of the Elemental Law of Electricity.\par
Time to get to work. I’ll show you. Stupid birds.\par
…If Avery were here, she'd be dying laughing.\par
He’d need Minor Laws first, and he had something to go off of. He was thinking about the Thunderous Beast. The way it charged. That was the Major Law of Discharge, wasn't it?\par
He closed his eyes. His head tingled with the rush of the Law Fruit. His head felt dreamy but not sleepy, perfectly clear.\par
When he thought back on how that Thunderous Beast had charged, the move came fully-formed into his head. As clear as if he was seeing it for the first time.\par
He saw the way the Beast pawed, the way it tensed, the way the essence flowed down its body, made shockingly vigorous by the Laws flowing through it. It was a sudden thing—taking it in all at once, holding it there, under immense pressure, down to the feet—and kicking off instantly. In a massive burst of power.\par
…He already knew this, kind of. It was pretty similar to Eruption, wasn't it?\par
He watched it through again, paying careful attention. It really was similar. He felt he got the gist of it after just a few watch-throughs.\par
The more you put the two of them together, the more a strange sparking happened in his mind. They connected in so many ways—he wondered if it was like this other Laws. It felt like it should be…\par
He went through it again, and again, and the picture filled out in his mind. It was about weaving in the Laws, concentrating the power. Then letting it suddenly loose. An explosion. But the way it expressed that explosion was different from fire. Eruption was a continuous thing. This was instantaneous, but it wasn't directionless. The rest he knew. He honed in on the difference. That point, the point of contact.\par
He watched back the moment the Thunderous Beast kicked off, searching for the crack there. It didn’t take long to find it. He peered into the beyond, trying to make sense of it…\par
It wasn’t long before—\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Spark\par
Neat.\par
He had some more Fruit left in him, and his head was still buzzing with the thrill of the learning. He dove straight into the next one. It was so close to the Spark Law he felt he already knew half of it. If there was a Spark, there had to be a buildup, right? A charging. And it came in the way the Thunderous Beast crouched down, the way it commanded all that essence to flow through, to hold still, to ready for the moment of impact…\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Charge Accumulation\par
How long was that? Time was tricky in Law traces, but there was no way that took longer than half a day. That was the fastest he’d ever learned a Law.\par
He was starting to wear thin, but he had all he needed. Just one last thing to learn.\par
He pulled out the Thunderfoot Scroll and sat down with it beside the obelisk. Right in its charged embrace.\par
He closed his eyes, crossed his legs, and let his body dissolve. He breathed in, out, in…\par
It didn’t take long before he was gone. He wasn’t in some gorge in Portland anymore, but in some unknown space, floating outside his body, a pure space of the mind.\par
Colors flooded that space. Shapes. The scene shifted…\par
He stood there, crouched in the middle of a vast plain. Not him—he was seeing through the eyes of Elder Yu, he guessed. It was dark. Thick thunderclouds rolled above, low to the ground. It seemed about to rain. The straw yellow grasses went up to his waist. Huge shadowy beasts lurked in the distance; deep howls carried on the winds. But those were all blurs. Elder Yu had eyes for just one creature.\par
And it was magnificent.\par
A zebra, but like none Zane had ever seen. This thing's coat had an understated gleam to it, like expensive metal. And it was huge, well-muscled, with its head held proudly high, a stallion with stripes. It snorted and a little thundercloud blasted out of its nose, crackling with tiny bolts of lightning.\par
It fired at the ground, and its stripes began to glow. It was starting the Skill. Zane tracked the way its powers coiled down its legs, coming to a simmering rest on its massive hooves. It wasn't the same Skill as what the Thunderous Beast used, but so much of the mechanics seemed similar…\par
It didn't leap. It blasted off. The force was immense—you didn't even see it go, just saw the blur of it, the bright afterimage left as it streaked into the distance. There was a crack as it broke the sound barrier. Then it was one white line fading into the horizon.\par
The instant it moved the savannah flattened. Grasses were mowed down as though they were bowing in awe. And all the Zebra left behind were its hoofprints shining in the dirt.\par
The scene faded, but the hoofprints lingered. Zane blinked.\par
Skill learned!\par
Volt Blitz [Rare]\par
Zane breathed out. To his surprise, he saw his breath crackling a little with electricity—sparking with it, just like the Thunderfoot Zebra’s.\par
He grinned. Oh, yes. This will do just fine.\par
Standing, he stretched out his arms, his legs. Then he left the Cavern.\par
He had hardly gotten out before the Stormtalons found him again. They started circling, cawing, floating around him.\par
Damned birds. Round two.\par
He had a plan. No Chain this time, no Axe—too heavy. He needed pure speed. He’d take them down one by one if he had to.\par
He started charging up for the Stomp. The Minor Law of Charge Accumulation poured through his body, his essence pooled into his feet, crackling fast. The birds saw he was up to something. They started shocking him with those Lightning Wings. He’d planned on just tanking these—it wasn’t like he needed to be in motion to charge up, like with his Cyclone. But this time the charge poured straight through him, down to his feet.\par
…He’d just absorbed it. Huh.\par
Maybe it was because it was an Electricity Skill? It was already charging up, so it just took the new energy?\par
The transfer was weirdly smooth. Before, it’d gone straight into his internal organs, or his brain, or his muscles. But now his body just caught it and used it.\par
Something about the way Steel Laws wove into his body, working with Charge Accumulation… there really was a synergy. Maybe the universe was made to work together. He had that weird feeling again. Maybe at some very, very high level, it all came together.\par
Anyway. Back to the matter at hand.\par
The Stomp. His essence was well and truly loaded now. His feet had so much electricity they physically hurt. His skin was straining to hold it all. Go time.\par
He coated his body with Fire Laws.\par
Volt Blitz!\par
He would later realize charging his Volt Blitz for ten seconds straight, and pouring so much energy into it, was way overkill. He didn’t realize it in that moment. In that moment he was just hyped.\par
Then he stomped.\par
One moment he was on the ground.\par
The next moment he hit the side of the gorge so hard he gave it a new crater.\par
…Ow.\par
As he slid to the ground, massaging his face, he tried looking on the bright side. At least he knew the thing worked. He was still clumsier than he would have liked, but he could move now. He could really move now. In spurts, at least.\par
He looked up at the birds. They seemed to be laughing twice as hard.\par
…Okay, so he deserved that one.\par
But they wouldn't be laughing for long.\par
He had a feel for it now. He just needed to get the essence just right.\par
He crouched down, and aimed for a bird perched right above him.\par
Volt Blitz!\par
One moment he was on the ground. The next air whooshed past him, the cliffs streamed by. Zane caught the briefest glimpse of the bird—the sheer disbelief in its face as it clocked the giant clunky human hurtling toward it at mach speed. There was a squeal, a splattering, and he was spitting out feathers. He looked down.\par
Below him where a Stormtalon had been a second before, there was now a fireball. Its buddies went flickering away, screeching in fright.\par
He’d made himself a human flaming cannonball. And he'd slide-tackled it out of existence.\par
As he fell, he had the biggest stupid grin on his face.\par
That had no right being so satisfying.\par


\section{67. Thunderdome (III) }
\par
\par
The other Stormtalons fled, squawking loudly. \par
Zane licked his lips and bounded after them.\par
The neat thing was, he was kind of a tank. And not just because his body was woven with steel—which meant it was pretty useful when he hit stuff at high speed.\par
He was also a tank because he had a huge amount of essence. Enough essence for every single bird here. \par
He picked out his next target. It saw him coming, started up in shock. He leapt for it. It flickered away before he could get there, and he splattered into the wall. But he didn't care. He just grinned, turned, leaped again, and this time he went straight through it. \par
He didn't even see it clearly, just a yellow blur. Then he was wiping blood out of his eyes. Blood matted his whole body. He'd hit it so fast it just… exploded.\par
Awesome. \par
He lunged again and again. He blitzed up a wall, kicked off and mowed down half a ‘V’ of them. A couple more leaps, and he smashed through the other half. Most of them splattered against his chest. He headbutted few too. One he thought he’d missed, until he felt warm wetness on his shin bone and saw he decapitated the thing entirely by accident.\par
It was neat being this big. It was harder for them to get out of the way. And he didn't need to hit them with much. Any bone going that fast had them splattering. \par
He felt like one of those dogs that had been let loose at the park, chasing after its favorite ball. He was in bliss. He figured this was what life was about—these pure simple joys. \par
Soon, he'd splattered most of them. The rest decided they were better off hiding in little nooks and crannies, shooting lightning at him from behind when he wasn’t looking. They were back at it again. Little pricks. \par
 He didn't feel like digging them out one by one. So he got out his Axes and started setting up a Cyclone. A few of them still zing’d him as he went, but there were so few of them left he shrugged it off easily. \par
Once the Cyclone got up to the seventh revolution, harsh fingers of wind started sneaking between the crags. By the eighth, ninth, tenth revolution, the birds were dragged squealing out, and they roasted too.\par
He ran down the length of the gorge, and his Cyclone followed him, mopping up monsters the whole way down.\par
He ran straight into the Thunder Roc's lair.\par
Similar thing to the other two Boss lairs. Just a craggy chamber, judging by the mini-map—though Zane couldn't see much through all that fire. Red dots were scattered throughout. They quickly started vanishing. The Cyclone’s fires just licked them up and spit out ash. Ash that turned to essence, and flowed straight into him.\par
Not enough for a Level yet. But he was getting kind of close.\par
Then—\par
A shock tore into the edge of a Cyclone, puncturing it instantly. A beam of dazzling, sparking light slashed over him. It cut down and split the Cyclone in two, tossing the whole thing sideways, making it teeter. Lightning rippled through fire.\par
Zane lost control of it. The Cyclone sputtered out. And he saw who’d done it.\par
Thunder Roc \par
Essence Level 80 \par
Laws: \par
Major Law of Electric Radiation \par
Major Law of Discharge \par
Key Skills: \par
Surge Flight (Active) [Rare]: Envelops the wielder in a surge of electrical energy, boosting speed dramatically. Allows the wielder to move across the battlefield like a bolt of lightning, leaving trails of electricity in their wake. \par
Bolt Beam (Passive) [Rare]: Unleashes a focused beam of intense lightning, striking at enemies from a distance. The beam can fork to hit multiple targets or focus on a single point for massive damage, making shockwaves on impact. \par
The Roc glared down at him from its rocky perch, head held high like an emperor looking at some unruly peasant.\par
Then it blasted him. \par
If those Stormtalon shots were static shocks, this felt like being hit by a taser. It had Zane jerking, almost flopping over before he chucked out a Rising Sun Slash to cut it off. He grinned, Chains at the ready, as it opened its mighty wings and lifted off. It screeched a challenge.\par
Excited, he ran after it. It looked mad. It looked ready to tussle.\par
…he should’ve known the thing would run.\par
It somehow managed to run angrily. He leapt after it, and it zip-zip-zipped down its lair, where it could chuck a bolt at him from a nice safe distance. And when he got close—zip-zip, and it was gone. On the other side now, ready to potshot at him. \par
Zane was starting to think all birds were assholes.Stolen from its rightful author, this tale is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\par
Grumbling, he dropped his Chains. By now, his Health was dipping near 75\%. And the annoying thing about electricity was there was nothing for Rebirth in Flame to heal. He wasn't wounded, just… shocked?\par
That Boss could probably keep blasting him until he hit zero. And he wouldn't get a swipe on it.\par
Zane had no respect for this style of fighting. \par
But now, at least, he had something for it. \par
He dropped his Chains and made himself as light as he possibly could.\par
Then, with a Volt Blitz, he streaked straight for the Roc.\par
He missed. He face-planted into a wall. The bird was on the other side of the cavern, sneering at him—its eyes widened. He was lunging at it again. This time, it hardly got out of the way; he crashed through another wall. A plume of dust rose up from the crater…\par
And he burst right out of it, straight into that oversized chicken. He saw the shock on its face. \par
It even squawked like a chicken as it went down with him. He didn't expect to explode it, but getting hold of it was enough. The instant he did, he latched a Chain around its wing.\par
Then he felt like he'd gone on the world's most violent roller coaster ride. It went up, down, left, right. It threw him into a wall, then another wall, tried to scrape him off with a rock column, bashed his head into the ceiling, and the floor, and the ceiling again, then wiped the wall with his face, and the second time for good measure.\par
The problem was, Zane had a very thick skull. \par
The thing started tasing him, but he just kept clinging on. Every time it did that blink-zig-zag, his whole body shuddered. Soon,\par
Warning! Health under 75\%\par
Zane grinned a checkered grin. His front teeth had been knocked out. He was very happy about it. That’s how he knew he was in a real fight. Finally!\par
He dropped his other Chain like an anchor. He set it as long as it would go—which was also as heavy as it would go.\par
And the Roc went down flailing, spiraling, squawking in panic. It tried to burst back up, but he got another loop of his Chain around its wing, and it started listing heavily sideways. Together they crashed.\par
It tried to get up, but Zane got a loop over the other wing too, then another, and dragged its screeching to the ground. When it fought back up to its talons, it was so hopelessly tangled it could hardly move.\par
It pecked at him, drawing blood on his chest, but it hardly got past the skin. He laughed.\par
Then it seemed to realize there was only one thing it could do.\par
It opened its mouth, and a beam of ruthless white light shot out. The same brilliant white that’d slashed his Cyclone in two. \par
He took the blast at point-blank range.\par
He couldn't move. He couldn't see. Every muscle in his body locked up hard; his jaw clenched so hard his teeth hurt. All he could do was spasm.\par
But he could still spasm his arm right about up to the Roc's neck—and spasm a Chain around it.\par
There, he pulled out an old Skill. Old but reliable.\par
Promethean Noose!\par
The Roc's eyes bulged, it started to gag. The black Chains lit up red-white like a molten collar; its flesh began to roast.\par
Zane would grin, but his face was already stuck in a grin against his will.\par
Warning! Health under 50\%\par
Savage Body Activated \par
Vitality increased 25\% \par
Speed increased 25\% \par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Which helped—he strangled with his new strength. His Chains were an expression of his power; it helped him tighten faster. They were in a race to the death. Could the Roc electrocute him first? Or would he strangle it?\par
It poured all it had into Zane. And Zane poured all he had too. He dragged the boss down to his level. He felt oddly proud, even as he was slowly dying—he was teaching the thing what a real fight felt like. The passion of it—the fun, the joy, giving it your all in body and spirit! Yes! This was what it meant to be alive! \par
The Roc did not seem to be enjoying itself as much as he was. It seemed furious. And increasingly scared as the Chains got tighter and tighter, and the heat got into its veins, started seeping up its throat.\par
It tried squawking. It choked. It threw one last stab at him, everything it had, a sudden burst of power—\par
Warning! Health under 25\%\par
Then it thrashed one last time and lay still.\par
Thunder Roc has been slain! \par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 82 -> 83\par
C-rank Dungeon Gorge of Elemental Winds has been cleared! \par
It turned out the Roc also had a nest, and there Zane found a few more Lightning Law Fruits along with some Essence Vials. There was also a Wind movement Skill, which was mildly intriguing—it let the wielder ride on a gale, so long as they kept up a certain dance pattern of steps—but he had little use for it.\par
The most interesting things there were the Thunder Roc eggs, and he took great pleasure in draining them.\par
That done, he headed up to the first floor and checked out the Dungeon Chest that had spawned. There he found the best treasure yet, lying on top of a giant mound of mid-grade essence stones.\par
Gentle Snow Dew (C) \par
The eyes are clearest at dawn. Collected with permission on Planet Gentle Snow, the property of Master Thai’le, the Plum Blossom Sword. Each droplet clears the mind, providing a roughly equivalent boost to a C-grade Law Fruit. This vial has six droplets.\par
A simple vial tied at the top with a plain white ribbon. The liquid sparkled faintly within, winking at him.\par
*** \par
By the time he climbed out of the Gorge, the setting sun painted the sky golden red. Reina met him at the palace.\par
“So? How was it?”\par
“I have destroyed the birds,” he proudly informed her.\par
“…What?”\par
He went off to check his World Ranking. The Beacon was right outside the palace, in the middle of a courtyard—he found he was up to World Rank 35—which was what, a ten or twenty spot jump? All in all, he was pretty pleased.\par
*** \par
That night, he got out the Dreamweaver Veil and his Snow Dew droplets. He was trying to find a quiet place in the palace when Reina caught up to him, wearing a nightgown that looked uncomfortably tight, especially around the chest. It accentuated her figure well, and she wasn’t someone whose figure needed any accentuating to begin with. \par
She said she knew he’d leave soon. She made it clear she was very eager to take advantage of their time together.\par
He tried to explain he couldn’t. He explained how he meant to take the night off and grind through his backlog of Fire and Steel Laws. Maybe even pick up an Electricity Major Law, too. The whole time she stared at him dumbstruck. He got the feeling she wasn’t used to being turned down for this kind of thing.\par
He got the sense she was a little miffed. He felt helpless.\par
Anyway. He found a spare room, settled down, drank the Dew droplets, and put on the Veil. Then he clasped hold of the Orb of Azeroth, the Stormheart, and the The Sermon on the Law of Iron. And he drifted off. \par
\par


\section{68. Law Binge}
\par
He drifted away almost instantly.\par
It was like he was in one room and stepped into another—a hazier room, less defined, more felt. But his mind still felt just as sharp. He felt awake. Unnaturally so, for a dream.\par
He was hoping to get through at least two Major Laws this session, one of Fire and one of Steel. Maybe a third Electric Law, if he could manage it. He'd give it his all.\par
First up, Fire. He could feel the three Law treasures out there, hovering near his soul. He went for the Orb of Azeroth.\par
The Major Law of Ethereal Flame. The Law that founded the Cult of Black Flame, pretty much. He already had one chunk of it—Fiery Rebirth. He reached for the orb and sought the rest.\par
The scene shifted.\par
It came in vague, like an impressionist painting. Some sort of bleak forest he could barely make out. The trees were shifting shadows, and the ground was splotches of brown. The clearest shapes were the spikes—spikes tipped vivid purple. They crowned vines that choked the forest, wrapping the trees, stuffing the paths, coiling like an endless nest of snakes.\par
There stood Azeroth in the midst of it, kneeling, staring up at the sky, gasping. The demon bled black blood. Zane didn't see the wounds so much as the colors. The spikes' bright purples shone in the demon's wounds. They went deep, seeping far beneath the skin, and they were spreading. Corrupting.\par
It was like Zane had X-ray vision. Then he realized he wasn't really seeing the world. He was seeing the world beyond the world, the true face of the world. He didn't need to search for the crack—he was past that. The truth was laid out plain before him.\par
This world was the inverse of the world he knew. The fine details, the material surfaces, the flesh, and the matter—that was all muddy.\par
But the Laws that ran through it all, under the surface… he saw them clear as day. Clear as colors. The purple was a kind of poison Law. And it had Azeroth wounded deep.\par
Then Azeroth put his hands together as though in prayer. It seemed a little odd. Did demons pray? To who? He was using some kind of Skill, Zane figured—one whose powers were far beyond him, one that drew on several kinds of Law, all meaningless. But the centerpiece he saw clearly.\par
It was a pale fire. It blossomed at every wound and started burning on the purple. The purple melted away. It wasn't Fiery Rebirth--that Law healed, but this Law destroyed and healed at once.\par
No, that wasn't right. It didn't really heal. It just destroyed—it cured the poison. It cut out the blemish, the impurity, the corruption. But removing a negative was a positive.\par
It all felt a bit like an acid trip. The most lucid acid trip he could have. The warbling colors before him made so much sense….\par
It clicked.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Fire's Purity\par
The scene shifted.\par
Shifting black grounds. Wounded purple skies. The same impressionist vagueness. There stood Azeroth, gasping, riddled with heavy wounds. And facing him, on the other side, was a man who seemed human. Golden-haired, well-built, dressed in heavy white-gold armor. His sword shone with a holy light. He seemed like a paladin. If this were a story, he'd be the hero come to slay the evil demon.\par
The man had Azeroth on his knees. He pointed his sword and said something—or rather, his lips moved, but the sound came out in that other place, the other world, and Zane couldn't hear it. But Zane could imagine the gist of it.\par
Azeroth just laughed.\par
Then the demon burned.\par
Not his body—something deep within, and separate, something that suffused every inch of him—his soul.\par
Azeroth stoked his soul again and again, the way you use a poker to stoke a hearth. Zane saw it was some kind of Skill again, but that Skill was tipped with a certain Law. He peered closer…\par
Azeroth roared to his feet. Suddenly, he was blazing with essence, blazing with life, a living pyre. He swiped, and a ghostly claw crashed down on the hero. He swiped again, and splotchy black-red meteors drilled down from the sky. It was like he had tapped into some unknown reserve—a reserve of the soul, a last resort.\par
The hero tried blocking, throwing up glowing gold shields, but the onslaught grew relentless. He broke; he was forced to his knees. He cried out in shock. Then Azeroth took his head off.\par
Oof. Tough luck.\par
Anyway. The scene faded, and Zane was left with the impression of it. The burning of the soul—a burning of another fuel. That was all Fire, wasn't it? Taking what was there and releasing its energies. It could burn wood. When Zane threw out a Cyclone, it burned his essence—and whatever it touched. Of course, it could burn the soul. Inflame the soul.\par
Law comprehended!This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
Minor Law of Spirit's Incandescence\par
Though Zane got the sense this was a last-resort thing. He'd healed just fine when the Demon Cultist had given him a soul wound. But whatever Azeroth did was less taking a wound, more chopping off a finger, he felt. It wasn't the kind of thing you just healed from.\par
Cool to know, but not something Zane was interested in using. At least not how Azeroth did it. Zane seemed to have an unusually chunky soul, which was why he was so good at feeling out Laws. He didn't want to give any of it up.\par
The scene shifted.\par
Azeroth stood on white ground. All around him lay the emptiness of space. From here, you could see his planet, the Void planet—an almost unbelievably huge sphere made of gradient shades of swirling blackness, studded all over with coal-black mountain ranges. Spots of Fire spewed from their tips.\par
But Azeroth wasn't on his planet. He was on the moon, staring at the warbling bright red mass above him. The sun. It was a little more than a smudge of red in the haze of memory.\par
And underneath that sun, coming closer, was a glittering army. An army in white-gold gear—just like that hero had been. Zane couldn't see their faces, but somehow in this strange underworld he knew their feelings.\par
They were furious. They were here for revenge.\par
Azeroth regarded them coolly, then he raised his arms, and the sun's redness drew into him. Down his arm, into his body, simmering there, building hotter and hotter…\par
… and from below, drawing up, came the whiteness of the moon, another kind of power. They twined in him, fused to one in the crucible of his body.\par
Then he let it go. He screamed soundlessly, threw out his hands, and the light streamed forth. A swirling firestorm of two colors—one raging solar red, one cool moon blue. They wove into one another, making something monstrous. An unnatural disaster.\par
It swept the paladin army away with almost contemptuous ease.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Celestial Flames\par
The scene melted away. Zane was alone again, floating in the nothing. He breathed out slowly.\par
He had all the pieces—he could feel it. Now, to put them all together…\par
Fire's Purity.\par
Fiery Rebirth.\par
Celestial Flames.\par
Spirit's Incandescence.\par
His mind flickered from one to another. He saw the aspect in full. He knew the fires of the soul.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Major Law of the Ethereal Flame (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
He floated there, basking in it.\par
Well, that was exhausting. And rewarding.\par
But there was no time for rest. Another Law to go. Hopefully. He took care of one last errand—he delved into the orb of Azeroth and drew out that soul defense skill, Hellfire Cloak. With this new Major Law, it took little effort to grasp.\par
Skill Learned!\par
Hellfire Cloak [Rare]\par
He didn't plan on using it much, but it was nice to have something guarding against soul threats. He was done with Fire. On to Steel.\par
His main resource was the Sermon by the Sage of the Iron Fist. He touched on the Recording Crystal treasure.\par
The scene shifted again.\par
It came in impressionistic, yet again—it must be his state of mind. He'd taken so many of those Dew drops he was seeing things differently, instinctively. He saw the Sermon with fresh eyes—the Sage of the Iron Fist clapping his hands, his body turning to Steel, the shockwave he made. Then that punch. So heavy it felt like it might break the memory itself.\par
It was such a simple movement when you broke it down. But it took Zane's breath away. The Sage's whole body was one beam of shining gray light. And they knew the Sage had spoken the truth. If you could pick that mass apart, like with a prism, you'd find the colors of every Law of Steel, side by side.\par
It was so much he didn't know what to focus on. So he just let his mind wander. He cast about the scene. He'd learned for him, learning Laws was less about thinking, more about feeling, seeing what called to his mind. To his soul.\par
He let the recording play slowly… He found himself growing curious about the Sage's hands. Something odd was going on there. He squinted, tried picking out the colors—they were changing before the Sage even clapped, taking on different sheens. One was like iron. The other, something else.\par
And when he clapped, they flowed into one another, made something new. Something that mixed them both. Made Steel.\par
He played it back. He found that if he really focused, he had some control over the memory. He could rewind it, slow it down, zoom it in. Home in on that precise point. And watch it. Over, and over, and over.\par
Until….\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Alloy Alchemy\par
Ahh.\par
Right after the clap, too—he paid careful attention to the way that new light stilled in the Sage's body, and what changed. It was subtle, yet clear. Every line in his body was clean, sharp, defined, flowing from one to the next, precise as cast Steel. There was a new symmetry to his limbs, like his body was something crafted…\par
Law comprehended! Minor Law of Precise Casting\par
They just kept coming—Zane loved every second in this space. He wanted to keep learning until he drowned. The problem was he was starting to feel sleepy—weirdly tired. Could you feel sleepy in a dream?\par
All this… it was starting to take a toll. It had been all along. He'd just been too excited to really feel it.\par
But he had more in him. He had to push through. The scene played back, back to before the clap. He slowed it down as the hands met. There, Zane stared deep into that bright gray light. He could pick them out if he tried.\par
In that pure gray there was a strand of deep orange woven deep into the Sage's body. A subtle glow rising to the moment of the strike. It was what made the fusion possible. Metal didn't fuse cold. The Sage had made of his body a forge, spreading heat down his limbs. A heat that peaked with the clap and faded instantly after, firming the Steel…\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Heat Mastery\par
This one came surprisingly easy, maybe because his Fire Laws had helped him.\par
There was one more, Zane felt. It didn't take him long to find it. It was in the moment the strike finished. The moment the Steel fully settled, when the impurities had burned out of it, when it gleamed clean and bright and pure, with that telltale steel sheen. Polished, finished, flawless.\par
By now, Zane was slipping. The world was starting to clarify. The colors were starting to fade. It took him six or seven tries to grasp it. In the end—\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Steely Refinement\par
It was dizzying how many secrets lay in the Sage's one move. He knew now that they were all put there very intentionally. To the layman, it might just seem like a clap and a punch—simple moves. But maybe that was what it meant to be a master. To make the complex look effortless.\par
Alloy Alchemy, Precise Casting, Heat Mastery, Steely Refinement—they cascaded in Zane's mind. He was fading. He shoved them against each other like steel grinding, making sparks, trying to find the perfect fit by brute force. What was the concept that fused them? \par


\section{69. Reina}
\par
It wasn't an intellectual thing. It was all feeling. And as the feeling left him, he lost the magic. He couldn't find it anymore—it wasn't a matter of trying. Like grasping at water running between his fingers.\par
He was relieved when one last notification popped up as his dream faded out.\par
Major Law comprehended!\par
Major Law of Pure Forging (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
***\par
Zane woke up breathless. He felt exhausted. He didn't even want to think about trying for another Law. He'd done too much. This wasn't the kind of thing you walked off. He could tell it'd be days, maybe a week before he'd give Laws another go.\par
Lesson learned. Two Major Laws in one go was too much. For the first time he'd brushed up against the limit of his soul.\par
But he was still satisfied. Two Major Laws was still a lot.\par
What could he do with them?\par
***\par
He found a garden courtyard to practice.\par
So. Major Law of Pure Forging. His only steel Skill was Spirit Steel Body. They should go well together, right?\par
He tested it out. He sank Laws of Pure Forging into his skin, his muscles, his bones. He started weaving them in, just as he'd woven Unyielding Might. He followed the template of Spirit Steel Body.\par
Could he even do this? He thought back to Spirit Steel Body's description—\par
Gives the body the durability and density of Spirit Steel. Extremely resistant to both slashing and concussive damage. Steel grade scales with level.\par
Pure Forging went beyond "durability and density," right? So it went beyond the scope of the Skill.\par
But as he weaved, the Law went in just fine. The more he wove it, the more his body subtly changed, sharpening, smoothing, growing more robust…\par
Then—\par
Skill evolved!\par
Spirit Steel Body [Epic] -> Man of Steel [Epic]\par
Gives the body the density, durability, precision, flexibility, conduction, and purity of Spirit Steel. Extremely durable, powerful, and conductive. Steel grade scales with level. Properties adjust to the user's will.\par
He blinked.\par
...well, shit.\par
No one told him he could make new Skills.\par
He read it over again. Adjust…? He felt those Steel Laws like lights woven through his body. Lights he could turn bright or dim at will.\par
The brighter he turned it, the more his skin took on a subtle gleam, pure and blemish-less. It was the Law of Steely Refinement showing through.\par
His features sharpened too. Precise casting defined him, made him sharp—it brought out his jaw and his cheekbones, muscles, the separation on his arms, down his legs. He found a mirror in the palace and took a moment to inspect himself. Everything just seemed... cleaner. The lines on his body flowed smoothly, symmetrically, like a statue carved of marble.\par
He found he could superheat his body too, like a metal. He can make his grip incredibly hot. Any part of his body, really—his thermal regulation was off the charts. It was the Minor Law of Heat Mastery at work.\par
He could also make his skin texture harder or softer at will. When he dimmed his Steel Laws fully he seemed almost like any other human. You could only tell the difference if you inspected him very closely. Or cut into him—then it'd feel like cutting into kevlar.\par
He wondered how much more durable he was now. Nothing in that Gorge had really tested him. And while it was fun releasing all that pent-up annoyance on those birds... he did miss having a real challenge. Something to push him to the edge of a fight, something that really roused him.\par
Next up was Abyssal Crater. When he saw it on the beacon map, it presented as a C-ranked dungeon. But when he zoomed in on it, a little plus popped up next to it. C+… He wondered what it meant. Stronger, he hoped.\par
He'd soon find out.\par
***\par
Next up was his new Major Fire Law, Ethereal Flame. And since it was mostly the stuff of the soul, there wasn't much he could apply it to. He thought about layering Spirit's Incandescence on something like Rising Sun Slash, but it proved much harder than adding Forging to Spirit Steel Body.\par
Forging and Spirit Steel Body just felt like they should go together. But Rising Sun Slash was a physical thing, and adding a soul part… was too much of a leap.\par
What he could do was buff Rebirth in Flame.\par
He made a little pale fire dance on his fingertips. Then he poured in the rest of the Laws of Ethereal Flame. They came easily.\par
Skill evolved!\par
Rebirth in Flame [Epic] -> Fiery Renewal [Epic]\par
He made a cut down his hand and tried it out. It was a little better than Rebirth in Flame, healing-wise. But now it could burn through poisons too, poisons of all sorts—even lingering foreign essence that might stop a wound from healing. It could cleanse a wound as well as heal it.This tale has been pilfered from Royal Road. If found on Amazon, kindly file a report.\par
It didn't seem exclusive to him either. He saw no reason he couldn't use it on someone else. Could come in handy.\par
***\par
That done, he returned to the palace and found a note Reina had left for him. She invited him out to a mid-afternoon picnic. There was a map attached of a city he didn't recognize. It had directions.\par
Zane scratched his head. Then he went outside and saw the city on the map.\par
Reina had worked some kind of miracle.\par
When he left Portland, it was a war-torn wasteland. Black was the color of this city. The burnt-out buildings, the blackened barricades, the ashen streets.\par
Now he felt like he'd walked onto the set of The Lord of the Rings or something. Dark and light greens were everywhere. Green was woven into the wood housing, under the rooftop gardens, all along the pebbled roads. Vibrant purple flowers peeked out of wide swaths of well-trimmed grass, swaying softly in the wind.\par
Reina had told him some of her plans when they were sleepy, in bed together. She wanted to give Portland some of its old life back. He strolled down a pebbled path, past rows of quaint wood houses, smoke puffing up from the chimneys. He started walking down a riverfront.\par
A wide, strong flow of clear blue water ran straight through the middle of the city. He came across a lovely, historic-feeling wood bridge spanning its breadth. On the other side was a lumber town hall and a little nature reserve flitting with birds. There were dirt sparring arenas and a little cluster of dojos, vines woven through their roofs.\par
He saw some folk standing on the bridge, staring vacantly up the river in a daze. Some still looked haunted, like they couldn't believe where they were.\par
There were still huge chunks of the city undone. He saw them mostly across the river—the edges of this little green haven fading to black wasteland. But still… he shook his head. Nuts.\par
As they walked, he saw a little woodland treasure area called Tranquility Park teeming with essence—motes of soft glowing light drifted about between groves of massive dark green trees. People lay there resting. Some red tomes. He saw some of the resistance fighters he'd met sitting there on benches, watching the gurgling of an essence fountain.\par
Past that were the food stations, modeled to look like those quirky old cafes Zane imagined once peppered the city.\par
That was Reina for you. She got all the little details right. It still baffled him that she seemed to like him. He scratched his head. He was pretty much a Neanderthal next to her.\par
On his way back from his little stroll, an old man in a tattered vest came up to him, a shy little blonde boy at his side. The boy introduced himself as Jacob. He gave Zane a flower unlike any he'd seen in the city. It was duller and smaller, a little white-petal thing, kind of wilted—the boy said it was the only flower he'd found back when the city was still a war-torn waste. It was the boy's lucky charm. The thing he held onto as he cringed under the barricades, waiting for the Spell-fire to stop.\par
"Thank you Mister Sage," mumbled the boy. And he gave it to Zane. "This's for you."\par
Zane felt a soft warmth in his chest. He ended up putting it in his Bag of Holding, right next to all his other treasures.\par
It also gave him an idea.\par
***\par
Hours later, he arrived at the little grove where he and Reina would have their picnic.\par
The first thing she pointed out was that he looked different. He explained the changes to his steel body, and she studied him for a bit.\par
Then she said, "You said you could adjust it?"\par
"Yeah."\par
"Could you lower it a little?"\par
"Sure."\par
He did, and the sharp edges softened some. His skin did too. He asked her why.\par
"Maybe it makes you a little more handsome. But you were already handsome," she murmured. They sat beside one another, leaned against a thick tree trunk. She put her head on his chest, her favorite resting spot. "I like you like this," she said, closing her eyes, sighing happily. "I can cuddle you easier."\par
Slowly, he stroked her hair, and they just lay there for a while.\par
They ate the sandwiches she'd made and murmured softly to each other. And by the end of it, just when they were about to pack up, he nervously reached into his bag of holding. Zane was not someone who got nervous. Reina just did strange things to him. His heart was going weirdly fast.\par
He brought out a crown made of bright, spotless steel. It gleamed gently in the soft afternoon light.\par
"What's this?" said Reina, blinking. She must've inspected it. "It's... not a treasure?"\par
"It was a treasure," said Zane, scratching his head sheepishly. "I melted it down. And... made this. For you."\par
He melted it down by hand, and molded it by hand, and tried engraving little flowers onto the thing. He wasn't sure they looked much like flowers.\par
She just stared quietly. He felt he should say something. "You know, 'Reina.' It means queen... right? So…”\par
It had taken him almost five hours, an embarrassingly long time for such a little thing, and a lot of tries. Way too many tries. He kept breaking them or twisting them. His hands felt way too big with these clumsy sausage fingers. He felt kind of stupid hunched over the tiny thing, trying to coax the steel into something pretty. He was so much more used to breaking things than making them.\par
He thought for a while about what to give her. But all his treasures were pretty much useless to her. In the end, he realized nothing he gave could possibly show his appreciation. All he had to give was his time, his body, and... a stupid little crown.\par
At least he tailored it. She loved resting her head on his chest, and he loved stroking her hair. So he had a good idea of her shape.\par
She was so quiet, still staring. "Zane..." she whispered.\par
"I put two major Laws into it," he said. "Unyielding Might and Pure Forging, so it should never break or rust."\par
He tried to make it sound unique. But the more he looked at it, the more amateurish and ridiculous it seemed. He wasn't a craftsman. This was stupid. He wasn't sure why he even bothered—\par
She threw herself at him and kissed him, bowling him over. Then she was on top of him. She kept kissing him.\par
He wasn’t the best judge of these things, but he got the sense she was pretty happy with it. \par
***\par
Before he set off the next day, he got a message.\par
Hey there! This is your buddy Elias. Just checking up! Couple things. First, I've got some swag for you—this awesome B-ranked treasure. Trust me, you'll love it. I hear you're doing a road trip. Drop by, will you? I'll have it ready for you when you get here. As it happens, I've got some special guests from abroad staying with me for a bit. We can have dinner, schmooze a little, it'll be a great time.\par
Also! Heads up!\par
There's this Faction called The Tomb Kings running out of LA. You might've heard of them. They're the second-strongest Faction in America. They've got pretty much all of Southern California locked down and chunks of Nevada too. You wouldn't believe these people. They've got like a dozen World Rankers. And their boss is this nasty dude, World Rank \#11, Mike Masters.... once you get past 20, they're all monsters. It's insane. There's a world of difference between someone like me or you and him.\par
I say this because they've been flexing a lot lately. They've sent teams crawling all over Northern California. I think they're trying to find something. Not sure what. They've claimed a shit ton of Safe Zones around these parts, though.\par
Now, you shouldn't have to worry about them! They're insulated from you. By me. They pretty much have to get through me before they get to you. And don't you worry! I'm taking measures to make sure they can never do that. Some of those guests of mine are part of that, actually.\par
Most of their focus isn't on us anyway. They have this crazy war going on with the Mexicans and their Cartels… it's a mess down there. Very bloody. Not my thing.\par
Again. You shouldn't have to worry. But I'd just be a little careful! If you see any 'Tomb Kings’ Faction members crawling around, steer clear!\par


\section{70. Winter Warriors}
\par
Before Zane left for the Abyssal Crater the next morning, Reina gave him a hug, buried her head in his chest, and sighed. \par
For a while she'd tried to be neutral toward him in public. She felt it was important to keep up appearances. But she'd come to the embarrassing realization recently that pretty much everyone already knew. People noticed her sneaking off to his rooms every night—including last night. And she was less discreet than she'd thought even in public. She'd asked Ethan, who'd become one of her trusted lieutenants, and the bearlike man shrugged. "Pardon, miss," he'd said. "Just look at how you look at him. It ain't subtle." \par
So Reina gave up. \par
"Here," she said, clasping a bracelet around Zane's wrist. It glowed with soft green runes.\par
"What's this?"\par
"A Signal Blocker, just in case," she said. "It'll block any weak essence signals within a hundred-foot radius. Including Life Crystal recordings."\par
She looked him in the eyes. "I read Elias's message. He played it down, but with these ‘Tomb Kings’… they sound very aggressive. If something were to happen—if they were to attack you—we don't want another Stroud. If you have to act, we don't want it traced back to you." \par
Zane nodded. "Hadn't thought of that."\par
She came up close. "That's why you have me," she said softly.\par
She kissed him, and he set off.\par
He resolved to bring a gift worthy of her when he came back. She was just Level 48 and still an Aegis Cleric—she barely had time to Level. And she was only that high because he made her take some of his treasures. He felt she was almost too selfless for her own good—she ran herself ragged helping folk. He promised himself he'd find a way to take care of her. \par
***\par
For a while, it was just a wasteland. A burnt-out stretch of black, flattened out like it'd all been bombed. Eventually Reina would get around to rehabilitating all this, he knew, but… damn. The Cult had wasted this place. As he went through mile after mile, it gave him a post-apocalyptic feeling. Soon he left civilization far behind.\par
No one lived here. Nothing moved but ash swirled by the winds.\par
It took an hour of running before things looked up again. He crossed into a Safe Zone that was mostly green, nearly untouched by the war—save for a few trees blackened at the edges. \par
Then they all started turning up green. Southern Oregon was a rich place before the Change. Once he got out of the wastelands, the Safe Zones showed it. All lush evergreen forests. He was back to a long stretch of forest Safe Zones, just like in Washington. This time there was more of a dewy, watery feel. Dew dotted the leaves, wet the branches. Rivers ran alongside the paths. He vaguely registered some folk in the distance a few times. Some scouts on treetops or Rangers on distant hills looking out at him, but they didn't seem keen to come close. He ran on mostly undisturbed. \par
He dipped into a valley and came across an odd Safe Zone—just a weird maze of vines. It might've been a vineyard once. He tried solving the maze, got lost, eventually just blasted his way through and kept running.\par
Soon he started gaining altitude. The Cascades were coming up fast. He saw them marked out in the distance, white peaks daring the sky along the horizon. They seemed bigger than the mountains he knew way back when. They probably were.\par
The ground got rockier, more rugged. He started going up hills. Sleet and ice started dotting the paths. After a while, a thin film of frost caked pretty much everything.\par
By then he was well into the Cascades. He came across his first real dungeon, a D-rank. It covered a small mountain. Lots of frozen waterfalls and icy paths and rocky ledges. It took him just two hours to clear, and most of that was running around from Boss Lair to Boss Lair. Two golems and an ice spirit. Light work. A good warm-up. \par
It was strange to think that the dungeon, which was an afterthought, was probably about as hard as Mount Saint Helens.\par
When he went about life, he didn't think about it much. But he'd changed a lot, and quickly, hadn't he?\par
He had to be getting close now. He was sure he was going the right way. He had a compass to help, and Reina had drawn him a map. An incredibly good map, because of course she was really good at drawing. Because, well, Reina. Zane could easily imagine the type of girl she'd been in school—with note-taking and penmanship that looked like works of art, always neat, with perfect grades, the smartest girl in class, but always happy to help if you had a question. So pretty she could easily be mean, but she wasn't. She'd be the type of girl everyone liked—the type half the class had a crush on. \par
It still astounded him that she liked him, of all people. \par
Anyway. Even so, it was hard to tell one mountain apart from another after a while…\par
Soon—\par
You have entered: Safe Zone: Frostspire Ridge\par
Faction: Winter Warriors\par
Not Luminous Faction. Huh. After they had vanquished the Cult, all of the Cult's territories had been grandfathered into Luminous territory. So far, he'd only been running through what was technically Luminous territory.\par
He figured these folk would know where the C+-ranked dungeon on their doorstep was. He thought about paying them a visit. He saw smoke curling up from the top of the mountain—people lived there.\par
He kept up the mountain path, still debating, when he saw dots pop up on his mini-map. They were coming the other way—just around the bend. Soon he saw them. They wore thick hooded parkas furred white along the edges. They all looked young—college age. Young and fierce.\par
And at the head of them was a lean, handsome young man who wore his hair long and loose; he kind of reminded Zane of Tarzan. He was bright-eyed and lusty, maybe a little younger than Zane even. Unlike the rest of them, he was half-naked; his chest was striped with bright blue war paint. His face was too. If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
Henry Colt (Creature)\par
Essence Level 46\par
Faction: Winter Warriors\par
"Halt! In the name of the Winter Warriors!" shouted Henry.\par
Zane held up his hands awkwardly and halted. "Look, I mean no harm. Just passing by," he said.\par
Henry considered him. "So you say," said the boy. "But from where I'm standing you seem awfully suspicious, big guy. A random passer-by on this out-of-the-way, hard-to-get-to mountain? Sure. You know what I think? I think you're a Black Flame cultist, come back for more!" \par
Zane scratched his head. Was it his face? His body? This kind of thing happened so often he figured something about him gave off villain vibes. \par
Henry thumped his bare chest and laughed. Not mockingly, but in a brave carefree way. "Haven't you goons learned your lesson last time? So long as I'm still around, I'll never let you touch my people! So you can go back and tell your boss—the Winter Warriors are here to stay!" \par
"That's right!" shouted some of the youths behind him. They were eyeing him nervously—really just the bulk of him, the way you might eye a grizzly bear. But they still seemed spirited. "Yeah!"\par
"I'm really not a Cultist," said Zane helplessly.\par
"Then prove it," Henry declared. He thrust out a finger, pointing straight at Zane's face.\par
"Show yourself! Now!"\par
"…"\par
"If you keep hiding, you leave us no choice! We'll be forced to come to blows," warned Henry. "Choose. Or face the consequences!" \par
Zane thought about it. He didn't seem like a bad person. Just… enthusiastic? They were probably just scrappy survivors hiding out from the Cult. Like those other stragglers had been. \par
So Zane shrugged. He dropped his mask. \par
"See?" he said, gesturing, "Not Black Flame. Luminous Faction."\par
"Aha!" Henry shouted. "That's—"\par
Then he fell silent, his eyes bulged, and his mouth hung slightly open.\par
By now, Zane was so used to this he could see the thoughts playing across the boy's face in real-time. First, he must have seen Zane's Level. He went pale. Then he must have seen Zane's Title, and he went very pale. He started trembling a little, like he realized who he'd just threatened.\par
"Savage… sage?" whispered one of the girls.\par
They all looked ready to piss themselves.\par
If Zane was honest, the Title didn't help either. It sounded like a pretty villain-y thing, didn't it? He was pretty sure his reputation was mostly positive. At least to neutral parties and friends. Nearby factions mostly knew him for liberating other factions and treating folk well—his entire reputation coasted off of Reina's work, basically.\par
His reputation as a fighter, though, against enemies… he wasn't even around the campfires much, and he'd heard some wild stuff. The farther he got from headquarters, the wilder the stories got. Just last night he'd overheard some Portlanders saying how he'd single-handedly turned back five Iron Legion galleons, chopped off Marcus Blackwell's head in a single blow, and drank the man's blood raw. Apparently he was some kind of vampire…? He wouldn't want to fight the Savage Sage they told stories about either. Well, he would, but—figure of speech.\par
“Uh,” stammered Henry. "I, uh… woah. Uh. Good! So, not Black Flame, definitely not Black Flame! Haha!"\par
He laughed nervously. "Wow. Savage Sage, huh. So. Mr. Sage, Mr. Savage? What, uh, should I—"\par
"Just Zane's fine," said Zane hastily. "I mean no harm. Really."\par
"Right, right! Of course!" Henry swallowed. "Would you, uh, please come with us, sir? We'd love to have you—we'd be happy to, honored, actually! Can I… uh… make you some tea, or…” \par
"Sure. Lead the way." \par
They led him up the winding mountain path, staring wide-eyed at him all the while. By now Zane was so used to the 'animal in a zoo' treatment he could shrug it off.\par
At the mountain's peak, he found a flat patch of snow-covered land. A horseshoe of yurts ringed an ever-burning bonfire. Dozens more wide-eyed stares greeted him there. The folk there were overwhelmingly young, in their 20s, some even younger. But it turned out their leader was an older man named Walter. He said he'd been living in the mountains here since before the Change. He'd still been here when a bunch of bedraggled refugees came fleeing the war, and he took them in. They became the Winter Warriors. \par
Walter was a short, gruff old man with a weather-lined face, a thick head of gray-white hair, and piercing blue eyes. He seemed a little surprised when he saw Zane coming. But then he just grunted and asked if Zane would like to come in for a chat. He, at least, seemed capable of acting like a normal person. It was a bit of a relief. \par
The yurt was heavy-duty, draped over a sturdy wooden frame with a thick hide covering. It looked rough from the outside, like it was built to take a battering. The inside, though, was cozy—gentle lanterns bathed the place in warm yellow, and a stove in the middle brought warmth. They sat down on thick little hide cushions. A little stone table lay between them.\par
"So," said Walter, "Henry tells me you took care of our Black Flame problem—"\par
The door flaps opened, and in came the boy in question, juggling a tray of hot tea. He set them down. "For you, sir—fresh off the stove!"\par
"Thank you," said Zane.\par
Then the boy just stood there awkwardly. Zane noticed he'd put on a shirt and wiped off the face paint. "Sir," he said again, "Actually, this is kind of embarrassing… uh." He flushed. "I'm… something of a fan of yours, actually… if you don't mind, uh. Could we have a spar? Just, you know, as practice—it's something of a dream of mine, sir—well, not a dream, just a goal, y'know—" \par
"Later, Henry!" snapped Walter. "Can't you see we're in the middle of something?"\par
"Right, right, sorry!" The boy scurried off.\par
Walter shook his head and sighed. "That boy. He's got a big heart, sure. But nothing between the ears. He wants to make himself a great warrior. A 'legendary' warrior, as he puts it. Fool boy. He wants to be spoken of… well. Like they speak of you."\par
Zane felt a little uncomfortable. "Don't believe everything you hear."\par
"You did free Washington from those Iron Legion scum, didn't you?"\par
"Well. Yes."\par
"And now you've cleared out the Cult of the Black Flame."\par
"That's right."\par
"Then we owe you a lot, Savage Sage," said Walter gravely. "So." He laced his knobby fingers. "How can the Winter Warriors help you?"\par
"I need directions to the Abyssal Crater," said Zane.\par
"You too, huh," Walter grunted. "Well, maybe you'll have better luck with it than the rest of them."\par
"The rest?"\par
"Oh yeah, it's a popular place. Not many C+ ranked dungeons around."\par
"Right. I was wondering about that. What's with the plus?"\par
"As far as anyone can tell," said Walter, "It means a dungeon between B and C. I'll tell you this, it's a hell of a lot harder than those C's. At least four of the teams that went in these past few weeks have cleared C's before. And none of them have come back out."\par
Zane blinked. “…There’s four teams in there?” \par
“Oh, far more than four have gone in. That’s just the strongest ones in the last few weeks.” \par
“Why?” That… seemed an unusual number of strong teams, to him. For one dungeon. \par
“Well,” said Walter heavily. “This dungeon’s a strange one. You might know—the place used to be Crater Lake. Some huge natural disaster happened there a very, very long time ago. And when the Change happened… well. If you believe the rumors, a Treasure Area formed in the crater. Some supernatural shit. That’s all I got. But from what I can guess, it’s... very good. It’s got strong folk running in like moths to a damned flame.” \par
He chewed on his lip. “Trouble is, they don’t come out.” \par
\par


\section{71. Winter Overworld (I) }
\par
“All we know about what's inside comes from a few NorCal folk,” Walter continued. “They were rich or lucky enough to have C-ranked escape portals on them. They got out. Well, the Faction Leaders anyway. Those things only let one man through. They say the Bosses were so strong their whole teams got wiped."\par
The old man shrugged. "Who knows? Could be they just saved their own hides. Could be their people are still in there."\par
Zane took a sip of the tea. “How many teams went in?”\par
“At least… say… fifteen?” said Walter. “That we know of. But most are dead by now, I’d guess. More keep coming, though. Those NorCal folk had to go running their fat mouths. Now folk are getting stuck in there—they’re inside, sending out Rescue Quests. They're pawning the house to save them. For some of them their whole Faction leadereship’s stuck in there. It's a joke. No one’s coughing up Escape Portals for parties that big, especially not C-ranked. Only way they’re getting out is if someone clears the dungeon."\par
It made sense to Zane. Escape portals were incredibly rare, especially for higher-ranked dungeons. You couldn't buy them from the Beacon Store, only pick them up as drops. Even Zane didn't have one.\par
Something stuck out to him, though.\par
"Hold on," said Zane. “‘Pawning the house’?”\par
“Yep,” grunted Walter, “There's four or five Rescue Quests floating around that dungeon—rewards are something like five, six C-grade Essence Vials per quest. They want out, and bad.”\par
"Hmm," said Zane.\par
"You thinking of taking them up on it?"\par
To Zane, it sounded like free money. And a lot of it.\par
"I'll say this," said the old man. "You're not the only Signed who's come round these parts. You're not even the only World Ranker. And so far, far as we know, the first floor hasn't even been cleared yet. Could be you're the one to do it. I don't know," he shrugged. "That's all I know, though. You decide if it's worth it."\par
***\par
When Zane went out he found Henry waiting outside, pretending to drill his moves in the square. Zane sighed and went up to the boy. He agreed to have a friendly spar.\par
It felt a little awkward talking to Henry. He was like… well, like a kid meeting his favorite NBA star, or something. He was stammering the whole time. His eyes were shining. He spoke as if Zane was far more important and interesting than he actually was. Zane wasn't sure how to handle it.\par
And when the spar came around, suddenly the square was alive with people. It felt like the whole Winter Warrior Faction crawled out to watch—there must’ve been a hundred-odd people in parkas standing in a loose circle, cheering.\par
Zane tried not to embarrass the kid. But it was weirdly hard. The power difference was just too big. Even without using most of his strength, the difference in fighting experience—in fight intuition—was also too big. Walter had it right, the boy had heart. But he was too predictable. When he rushed then, swinging wildly, all Zane saw were holes.\par
Eventually, Zane got out his Chains, which drew gasps all through the crowd. A chant came up: “Axes! Axes! Axes!”\par
… How did they know about his Axes? Zane thought, ducking another one of Henry's wild screaming blows and giving the boy a soft tap on the backside which sent him sprawling. It was always a little jarring realizing people talked about him. People he'd never met. Even somewhere as remote as these mountains.\par
He supposed they weren't that far apart, in the grand scheme…\par
They’d been nice enough to him, so Zane did get out his Axes—to wild cheering—and did a couple of twirls with them. He made sure never actually to hit Henry, though he did send the boy's spear flying.\par
In the end, he gently bound the boy with his Chains, made him yield, and that was the end of it. \par
Afterwards, Henry came up to him and asked for some tips. Zane didn't feel he had anything profound to say. He just gave some basic advice—don't swing so wildly, time your shots better, that kind of thing—and Henry listened a little too intently. Zane got the sense he'd take these words to heart forever.\par
Zane wasn’t built for… whatever all this was. Too many eyes on him, he felt. He scratched his head; he just wanted to punch monsters. They were all stood around staring at him—He wasn't sure if he was meant to give them some kind of inspirational speech or something. In the end, he just left it there and wandered off. They seemed happy enough.\par
Before he left, Walter asked him to sub-Faction for protection. Zane put him through to Reina.\par
He also borrowed the Winter Warriors' essence began to check out those Rescue Quests. It was like Walter said.\par
URGENT: Rescue Requested at Abyssal Crater Dungeon!\par
Calling all World Rankers, and teams of World Ranker strength! We [tk] are trapped on the first floor of the Abyssal Crater Dungeon. Requesting immediate rescue, either by providing sufficient escape portals, or by clearing the dungeon!\par
Reward:\par
Five C-ranked Vials of EssenceThis story has been taken without authorization. Report any sightings.\par
There were four quests like this, some offering three Vials, some offering seven. If it wasn’t Vials it was other essence treasures. All of them had a prerequisite to accepting them—the System had to recognize them as a World Ranker.\par
Zane took them all.\par
If he cleared the dungeon, that was enough essence to boost him past Level 90, probably. He was feeling pretty pleased as he set off for the Abyssal Crater Dungeon. \par
*** \par
He set off around noon. There was one last climb through a wintry forest. The trees, tall and solemn, had boughs heavy with fresh snows. His footsteps crunched as he went.\par
It took half an hour of climbing before he saw the peak coming up—a wide rocky lip. A few leaps took him to near the top of it.\par
You have entered: Dungeon: Abyssal Crater (C+)\par
Clearance Objectives:\par
Slay the Phoenix of Falling Snows X \par
Slay the Overlord Basilisk\par
Slay Nymeria, the Blizzard Wolf\par
Second Floor\par
Slay the Leviathan Glacier Whale\par
Slay Jotunn, Lesser Ice Giant\par
Objectives Met: 1/5\par
Zane wondered at it for a moment.\par
Five bosses. It was the biggest dungeon he'd ever been in. \par
Nymeria? Jotunn? He’d never seen bosses with names before. Curious. He wondered how they were different. \par
At last, he crested the rocky ridge. \par
It went left and right for miles in a slow, long arc that made the lip of the crater. And below, sloping down hundreds of feet, was a sprawling landscape of snow and ice and stone, peppered with trees. There were frozen rivers and ice-covered rocky outcrops, and frozen waterfalls draped all over. Bitter winds swirled, drifting snow.\par
In the distance, on the far side, there were even little lakes hissing steam where flowing water gurgled—as though geothermal vents lay hidden beneath. A strange little micro-climate amid the cold.\par
The whole place glittered in the noonday sun, brilliantly white, brilliantly blue. Almost blinding.\par
But that was just the crater’s rim. \par
The centerpiece lay in the middle. And it dominated Zane’s sight. A frozen lake. A mind-bogglingly huge expanse of ice, so large it dwarfed the already-massive rim. \par
It was a blue so bright and pure it seemed unreal. It threw back the color of the sky, but even brighter. It was so clear Zane could see the tunnels stretching far underneath, crossing over one another in an infinite lattice, a hidden world under the ice. He saw schools of strange, monstrous, large fish frozen in between. He saw huge gray shapes even farther beneath—were those whales? Then below even them, he could make out the outlines of murky chasms where vague ghostly creatures shifted, scarcely seen…\par
The Second Floor. \par
Zane was not an easily awed man. But this… this was breathtaking.\par
His gaze shifted back to the surface. \par
There was something in the middle of that vast frozen lake. From afar it looked like an island topped with trees so pale they seemed like ice sculptures. Even from out here, Zane could feel the Law flowing off it like heat—not any Law he knew.\par
That had to be the special treasure area. It was a little too far to make out even on his mini-map. But it was a Law treasure area—that much was clear. Something like a Cavern of Insight, he guessed? Which was a little disappointing— For now, at least, it was useless to him. He was still too fried from his last Law session—\par
Wait. Was that… a person? It was a little hard to see. Could be blonde hair, could be ice… no. Some woman stood there, hands on her hips. She was tall and slim. That was all he could make out. \par
He couldn’t see her face from out here. But for some odd reason, he swore their eyes met. \par
She turned and vanished behind the trees. \par
Odd. Well. It seemed the Cavern—treasure area—whatever it was, it was in use. He scratched his head. If he was in there comprehending Law, he probably wouldn’t want to be disturbed. \par
He’d clear the Bosses first, give her space for now. But he’d check it out before he went to the second floor, at least. Hopefully she’d be done by then. \par
He started his way down the slope, got into the thick of the crater rim. It was all rocky, snowy forest.\par
It wasn't long before he came across his first patch of X's. A team had died here, in the middle of this innocent-looking snowy clearing. He wondered what killed them.\par
He kept walking. Soon enough he found out.\par
Red dots popped up at the edges of his map—a clump of them, moving shockingly fast. Zane turned to face them, frowning. They burst into the clearing so fast they seemed one huge streak of white light, almost indistinguishable from the snow they padded on. They panted heavily, their thick breaths frosting the air. Low growls tickled their throats. Their eyes glowed red. Great fangs stuck out of their mouths like saber-tooth tigers.\par
Primeval Snow Wolf (Monster)\par
Essence Level 67\par
Law: Minor Law of Frostbite (Elemental Law of Ice) \par
Key Skills:\par
Frost Fang (Active) [Rare]\par
The wielder’s bite inflicts frostbite on its victim’s limb, deadening it instantly. \par
Pack Command (Active) [Rare]\par
Wolves find strength in packs. They have intuitions which border on telepathy, allowing them to coordinate attacks supernaturally well. Packs of Snow Wolves have been known to end entire armies who vastly outstrip them in Level. \par
Their weaknesses—belly and throat.\par
There must’ve been twenty or thirty of them, all in the 60s. Zane had hardly registered them—they were already on him, falling like an avalanche. His Axe was out in an instant. Too slow. The frothing mad beasts tore into him.\par
Before Spirit Steel Body, that might’ve been the end of him. Those fangs were wickedly sharp. So were those claws. They would’ve shredded even high-Level human skin.\par
Before Man of Steel, even if they hadn't instantly killed him, those fangs would’ve shot frostbite so deep he would’ve been immobilized. Easy pickings. \par
But now it felt like stepping into a fast-flowing stream and watching the water course around him. They left thick white scratches on his skin. They couldn't even break it—it kind of amused him, watching them scrabble and hack. \par
They were fast. He’d give them that. He had almost no time to react.\par
They crowded around, snapping, yowling. Two had lashed onto his thigh and were trying to gnaw it off. The rest were shredding his clothes fairly well. Not so much anything else. \par
He casually got out his Axes. Rising Sun Slash! \par
It was nice of them to put themselves in such a clean row for him. \par
A new color flooded this blue-white world. A furious yellow-red. It made a simple, almost lazy circle. \par
And many, many wolves found their top halves falling away from their bottom halves. They clawed at the air, had a moment of blinking shock. \par
Then there was a lot more red. \par
Zane kept walking. He imagined these things had something to do with that ‘Blizzard Wolf’ boss. He was in its territory. \par
Time to go hunting. \par
\par


\section{72. Winter Overworld (II) }
\par
After trekking through the forest for a while, Zane realized he was a pretty shit hunter.\par
He wasn't sure what he should look for. Tracks? He saw some but he couldn't tell if they were wolves, men, moose, or something else. 'Hunting' for him amounted to blundering around in the forest, hoping a really big red dot showed up. \par
That didn't happen. But eventually, a big cluster of red dots popped up at the edge of his mini-map. He drew closer and found they were hugging a smaller cluster of white dots. \par
He was there in a Volt Blitz—a step and he plowed through five straight trees. He rammed straight into a bank of fluffy white thicknesses; white clumps went flying. At first he thought it was snow. Then it howled and shrieked and started biting him, and he realized he'd overshot a little.\par
He'd just cannonballed straight through the wolf pack's flank. On the mini-map there was one blank line in the middle of that red mass—the line he'd just mowed down. He was pretty sure a few of the beasts straight-up exploded on impact. It'd explain the blood on him.\par
The wolves came at him in a fury, all at once, with lots of snarling slobbering teeth.\par
He got his Axes out.\par
As it turned out, it didn't matter much how many numbers you had if none of them could make a dent.\par
Wasting a hundred-odd Snow Wolves wasn't that much harder than wasting thirty. Just took a little longer. With every swipe, he sent up a wave of blood. Slick white fur caught fire, roasted to black crisps. He just waded into the midst of them and started whomping, blasting through rows at a time. He sent a fair few airborne, clawing at nothing. Some he chopped in half mid-air. He felt like one of those fancy French chefs, lining all those ingredients up and slicing them down the middle.\par
Soon there were just a handful of scattered red dots. And they went scurrying, yowling, their tails between their legs, slipping on pools of blood.\par
Which left Zane to face the crowd of people standing there staring at him dumbstruck.\par
Turned out they were three Factions clumped in one, clustered for self-preservation. It was pretty easy to make out who was who—one was called the 'Guardians of Eureka,' mostly grass Mages and Rangers. The 'Red Voyagers' in their red cloaks, and the 'Skyhawks,' wind Rogues dressed in light blues. Most Factions Zane found had a theme. The Luminous Faction was a bit more scattered, mostly because it was a Faction of Factions. But it seemed the exception, not the rule.\par
After they got all shock and awe out of the way, a burly gray-bearded man ambled up to him, smiling all relieved. "Zane Walker. Thank Heavens you came! Name's Clayton—I lead this little alliance of ours."\par
Zane blinked. "Do I know you?" \par
"You did take that Rescue Quest we put out, right?" \par
Right. That. "Ah. Yeah." \par
"Hey everyone!" Clayton shouted. "The strongest man in Cascadia's come to save us! Just a little longer and this damned nightmare will be over!"\par
Ragged cheers rose up. Mostly they looked too frazzled to be very excited.\par
Zane felt a little embarrassed—'strongest man in Cascadia'? That was a little…\par
… Now that he thought of it, it was probably true, wasn't it?\par
Eh.\par
Soon the Factions decided to go off to seek shelter. They were headed for one of the caves on the crater's other side—where they said wolves seldom went.\par
"Where can I find the boss? This 'Nymeria'?" Zane asked.\par
"Not sure," said Clayton. "She could be anywhere. This whole stretch is her territory. But she likes hunting the strongest and taking 'em out first… so." He swallowed, looking straight at Zane. "You'll find each other one way or another, I reckon."\par
"Hmm."\par
They left. Zane kept going the same way.\par
He dipped along the edge of the forest, near the sparkling frozen lake. Close enough that the little island in the middle came into his mini map's range. Sure enough, it was yellow—a treasure area. There was a white dot there. It had to be the same woman. But he hadn't expected to see an 'S' on it.\par
A Signed?\par
What had that Walter said? Zane wasn't the only Signed he'd seen around these parts. Nor the only World Ranker…\par
Could it be they were both still here?\par
Were they the same person?\par
These thoughts drifted idly by as he prowled. He had a feeling he and this Signed lady would meet again, sooner or later.\par
*** \par
He was coming up to the edge of this patch of snowy forest. Still no wolves besides the occasional straggler. He saw heated pools popping up in the distance—it was those geothermal vents he'd seen earlier. Up close they looked like the ones he'd seen on those nature documentaries about Norway or something. Though Zane had a feeling these were a lot hotter. The steam rose so high it seemed a low cloud.Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\par
A few treasure areas popped up around there. Some of those steaming hot pools vented sheer essence…\par
He blinked. Wait a minute.\par
He wasn't seeing things. There was a white dot somewhere beyond the pools, hidden behind a rocky outcropping, just out of sight. But it was clear on his mini-map. A single 'S' lay on it. It just sat there like it was waiting for something.\par
Had that blonde lady moved? But he had been going in the same direction and he hadn't seen her pass him. He hadn't seen movement from the island at all. That couldn't be another Signed, could it?\par
… No way. The odds… Even if this place attracted lots of powerful folks, three Signed in one dungeon?\par
The dot vanished. Like it'd never been there. \par
He blinked. Just weird stuff. He kept staring, but it didn't pop back up again. \par
Whatever.\par
Where was this wolf hiding? \par
***\par
And then, he came upon another bunch of stragglers. These ones were hidden in a cave. They seemed relieved and frightened at the sight of him—they asked him not to come too close. The wolves like to go for the strong ones, they said.\par
In the end, stymied, he just plopped himself in the middle of a clearing. Big fat target. And waited.\par
That did it.\par
Not five minutes in, dots started to circle in from all sides. Zane saw a particularly thick one drift closer at the head of the pack.\par
There we go.\par
They didn't come in fast this time. They just crowded in from all sides, pouring out of the tree line, mouths drawn in low growls, saber teeth bared. Like a slow-moving avalanche. \par
Then there was the wolf at the head of them. \par
Nymeria (Monster — Blizzard Wolf) \par
Essence Level 84\par
Law: \par
Major Law of the Eternal Frost\par
Major Law of the Blizzard\par
Major Law of Absolute Sharpness\par
Key Skills: \par
Slash of the Blizzard (Active) [Rare] \par
The wielder's slashes fall like blizzard winds, moving with incredible speed and ferocity. These strikes cut past skin, chilling to the bone. \par
Slash of Eternal Cold (Active) [Rare]\par
The wielder's slashes carry the powers of eternal winter, inflicting instant frostbite on whatever they touch. A well-placed slash can deaden limbs and even organ systems. \par
Pack Command (Passive) [Rare] \par
The wielder has absolute command over packs of their species.\par
She was twice as big as any other wolf. And from bone to fur to claws she was one pure color, the color of freshly fallen snow. So clean you couldn't tell where bone ended and fur began. And under that fur lay tight coils of sleek muscle. A powerful, terrible, beautiful beast.\par
Zane grinned at her. Finally! \par
They stopped there, circling him. The whole pack. All glaring.\par
She howled. \par
They swamped him.\par
They came at him so fast it was like they'd all turned into vicious winter winds and he was suddenly caught stranded in a blizzard.\par
It looked scary. Lots of flashing white chaos. It sounded scary. Snarling and slobbering and scratching and gnashing shrieking past his head. \par
Only… it didn't feel scary. They gave him the same scratches as the other wolves.\par
And like with the others, he made brutally quick work of them. \par
Blazing red slashes split the air, one after another. Red pierced the white, stained the blizzard, stained the snow-white grounds. Yowls drowned out the snarls.\par
Mostly Zane was just irked at them. He had to fight his way through them to get to the interesting one. He couldn't even see the great wolf until she bowled into him.\par
Four claws sank deep into his chest, tearing muscle. Then they raked down; blood poured. Zane hissed. A line of cold pain ripped down his torso, breaking at his hip. He stumbled back and the Blizzard Wolf was on him again, slashing the other way. She crossed a bloody X down his chest. And where her claws touched the wounds went black, thick with frostbite, deadened. He lost all feeling. Icy essence struck deep into the core of him, aiming for his heart—\par
And burned.\par
Every wound burned stark white as Fiery Renewal roared to life. Nymeria tried striking again. But this time he cut first. And his slash cut deeper.\par
Blood splattered the air. A molten line ripped through the wolf's chest; she yowled. But she didn't fall back. She whirled around, snorting ice, and lunged for his throat.\par
She slashed twice, deadened an arm. He slashed back with the other, drew a fountain of blood. Her next slash nicked a vein on his neck. Then he almost split her in two. They tore into each other; white slashes crossed red crossed white, lightning quick. Man's blood and wolf's splattered the white snow; soon there was hardly a white spot left where they stood. And it only spread, getting redder and redder...\par
The red drowned out the white.\par
In the end Zane was panting, kneeling, bloody claw-marks all over him. His health dipped dangerously close to 50\%. His skin was necrotic black, splotched all over. He couldn't feel his upper body anymore.\par
But the wolf was the one who lay still. That sleek pelt had been shredded utterly. You could hardly tell it had been white once. Zane limped over and put the creature to rest.\par
Nymeria, the Blizzard Wolf, has been defeated!\par
Objectives complete: 2/5\par
He stood and sighed happily at the sky.\par
Then he scratched his chin.\par
Pretty good appetizer. But… \par
"Not enough." \par
He stood. \par
"More," he breathed, grinning.\par
*** \par
Next, this ‘Basilisk.’ That was a fun scrap, but it only got him going a little. He hoped this Basilisk would really take it to him. \par
Though the Second Floor… he had a feeling that was where he'd find the true heavy-hitters. \par
He trawled around for a bit, poking into caves, checking out cliff faces, scouring the nearby forest. Where did snakes live?\par
After coming up empty, he looped back to those hot springs. He'd checked pretty much everywhere else along the rim…\par
Wait. He blinked. That Signed white dot wasn't on the island anymore. \par
It was in the hot springs region. Zane pushed his way out of the tree line, came up to the frozen water's edge, and saw her on the other side of the little bay.\par
The same blonde woman, tall and lithe. She turned suddenly as though she'd sensed him, and they locked eyes.\par
She was younger than he thought—she couldn't be much older than him. She had delicate features, like those of a princess—something about her just screamed high-born. The kind of face you might see on a magazine cover. Her most striking feature, though, was her eyes, bright blue and clear as ice.\par
Vanessa Volkova\par
Essence Level 86\par
Signature Title: The Winter Rose\par
Class: Aurora Sorceress \par
Faction: North Star Empire\par
'Volkova'—where had he read that last name before? \par
\par


\section{73. Winter Overworld (III) }
\par
Zane saw her Level.\par
86?\par
She wasn't just a World Ranker. She was ranked higher than him.\par
He was surprised. What were the odds of that? There must've been less than thirty people like her in the world.\par
She saw him staring at her and frowned. She threw a derisive glance at him like she'd just seen old gum sticking on the bottom of her shoe. Then she turned away, ignoring him.\par
Zane scratched his head. Had he done something wrong?\par
She turned to look to the spring at her feet, like she was searching for something. She narrowed her eyes.\par
Then she held out her hand, and gorgeous white staff burst into being, drizzling snowflakes. She stepped out onto the steaming water. It froze, crackling under her feet.\par
She took another step, then another. Soon she stood at the center of the pool, watching its depths. \par
She raised her staff. The weapon began to seethe. Cold light poured off it. A little storm of Law swirled around the tip of it. He felt the tremors drifting off it — at least two or three Major Laws all coiling together. And the essence…\par
So much poured into the staff it was a little shocking. And it just kept going, shining brighter and brighter until it was one line of dazzling blue-white light, drowning out all the other brightnesses around it. Hard to look at, like harsh sunlight shining off pure snow. \par
Zane was transfixed. The only person he knew who could put that much power in one shot was…well… himself.\par
Then she slammed the staff down.\par
It was like she dropped a pebble in the middle of a pond. A shockwave rippled the length of the spring.\par
Where it passed, water froze to ice. Not just the surface. It went down too, spiraling into the water's depths…\par
The steam burned off. Now the hot spring looked like just another chunk of that great frozen lake. Icy Laws coiled gently off its surface.\par
Then the whole thing started to tremble.\par
A little earthquake jarred the land, sent cracks shivering down the face of the ice. Vanessa leaped back with ease, landing nimbly as a cat. She eyed the cracking ice, staff raised, lips set.\par
Then the cracks all burst at once. They showered the air — a massive smoking hole had been blasted right in the middle of it.\par
And a serpent's head the size of a barm reared out, splashing steaming water everywhere. It kept going, climbing for the sky, and more and more of it burst out; it climbed so long you got the feeling it might go on forever. It was the size of a small skyscraper by the time its tail wrenched out. It loomed over her, blotting out the sun, its two orange slitted eyes like little devil-suns put there to replace it.\par
Overlord Basilisk (Monster)\par
Essence Level 85\par
The Basilisk opened its mouth, fangs dripping black tar, and shrieked. Not like a snake but like some awful bird. \par
Vanessa didn't seem cowed in the slightest. She looked unimpressed if anything. She raised her staff.\par
One moment the air was clear.\par
The next there was blizzard. \par
It came so fast, so suddenly, it was like she'd opened up a portal to some sleeting chunk of the Arctic and called its fiercest winds through. It was a sunny day for the rest of them. But the Basilisk was caught in a funnel of shrieking, twisting white currents. It hissed and bucked, but the winds wrenched that massive beast in. They wouldn't let go. \par
The sheer amount of essence in that blizzard… she had to be a Mage. But even among Mages, this was something else. Zane could tell that Boss was no slouch. Just the power it took to trap something that big...\par
Then the air started shivering with power, and he realized this was only the beginning.\par
Icicles glistened in air. Blue-white crystals honing to infinitesimally sharp points, glinting meanly at the ends. And they just kept getting bigger, longer, crackling as they did. They went from arrows to spears to whaling harpoons, then further—until they were half the size of the Basilisk itself. Towers of glorious essence, primed to blow. \par
It was awesome to see, honestly. She had so much essence she pretty much just bullied that huge Boss. \par
…it was how Zane liked to fight too, honestly. \par
She waved a hand. An icicle shot forth.\par
It lanced straight into the Basilisk. There was an explosion of ice, of Law, of power — a CRACK, the shattering of a scale. And it slid on through. Right through the meaty center of that huge beast. Bursting out the other side, sliding through until she had it on a skewer.\par
She waved another hand. And skewered it again. And again. And all the Basilisk could do was shriek. It thrashed, it spat gobs of black poison. But her blizzard winds took its attack and threw it right back. And all the while, Vanessa just kept throwing one icicle after another.\par
The Basilisk's thrashes grew weaker and weaker.\par
Soon Vanessa didn't need the blizzard anymore. She let it drop.This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
She'd skewered the beast so many times her attacks held it up—like some massive ice sculpture shining in the mid-afternoon sun.\par
He'd just witnessed a brute force beating. Zane wasn't sure he could have killed the thing that clean…\par
Just watching it got his heart going fast. He found himself grinning. \par
The oddest thought came to him.\par
He really wanted to fight her.\par
The Basilisk slowly dissolved, swirling to essence, swirling into her...\par
The Overlord Basilisk has been slain! \par
He wasn't really sure what to do in this kind of situation. It felt a little awkward just going up to her cold and saying, "Hi, my name's Zane. Would you like to fight me?" \par
And by how she'd looked at him, he got the sense she didn't want to be disturbed. \par
Besides, right now she looked pretty drained. That'd clearly taken a lot of essence out of her. \par
Eh. There were plenty of other fights to be had on the second floor, he was sure… \par
Something moved at the edge of his mini-map. It was coming in fast, weaving through the trees on the far side. Vanessa noticed it too. Her head snapped up. She frowned, then tensed.\par
A white dot with an S on it.\par
It take Zane a second to realize. That dot Zane had seen earlier, hanging around the pools... that really had been another Signed!\par
Darkness pooled at the edges of the trees, making a veil. And a man stepped out of the shadows.\par
He was dressed in black so fine he seemed made of shadows himself. He was a lean, muscular man with piercing dark eyes and jet-black hair slicked back. His face was sharp and subtly smiling. He wore a well-tailored suit with a plum-purple cravat. And he was clapping with hands gloved white.\par
Javier Mendes \par
Essence Level 90\par
Signature Title: Sage of the Crescent Moon \par
Class: Deathstalker \par
Faction: Tomb Kings \par
Level 90? Tomb Kings?\par
And he'd caught her low on essence.\par
He must've waited for her to burn herself out.\par
…Just what was going on? \par
He strode out of the shadows with a cool, casual confidence. He said something. Vanessa's face darkened; she spat words back, chin held high. He still seemed relaxed, darkly amused.\par
Then he raised his hands, and two huge silver knives, curved like crescent moons, dropped into his hands. Vanessa shouted angrily back.\par
He ignored her. And he slashed. One huge, gleaming crescent moon rippled through the air. Silently, almost gently—but deceptively quick. It crossed half the space between them before she could even react.\par
She threw up a hand. A wall of ice burst forth. It fractured. But it blocked the arc of the crescent moon.\par
Only the moment that crescent struck, it shattered too—into two smaller arcs just as bright, running at her just as fast. Her eyes widened. She threw up another shield. It broke—and the slashes split into four.\par
And hit her all at once.\par
 She cried out. Blood dripped down her snow-white dress. Cursing she raised her staff, and the air started shimmering blue-white… at the same time, Javier strode toward her. His knives made lazy loops around his fingers. Two discs of shifting silver. \par
Power erupted between them. \par
Zane still had no clue what was going on. This Javier had just ambushed her—and Zane wasn't a betting man, but he got the strong impression he wanted her dead. \par
He should probably just leave them to it. But for some reason, he couldn't make himself go. Maybe it was the draw of the fight. The force of it, the passion, the power… Man. He loved this stuff. \par
Just watching fascinated him. That girl was nearly tapped out, he could tell. But she still threw the house at Javier. Just an avalanche of ice pouring down on him, trying to bury him. She threw up blizzard winds, trying to trap him — and the man just easily shifted out of the way. She lanced at him with giant icicles — and he made her miss. And he struck back so easily, so effortlessly, it looked like he was dancing.\par
That man was smooth.\par
He took a few shots here and there. But he shrugged them off and struck back twice as hard. He was kind of butchering her. With grace.\par
… Now that Zane looked at it, Vanessa's moves were getting desperate. And he was only gaining. Even just in the way he moved. So clean, flowing like slivers of moonlight off a sharp edge. Damn! \par
Vanessa's solution was to just try harder. It… wasn't working. She was flagging. He was carving her up; beautiful curves of moonlight started ripping through her attack. She was a mess of blood, staggering now, almost delirious.\par
A thought crossed Zane's mind. \par
…Should he intervene?\par
Zane didn't know these people. It really wasn't his business, he told himself, scratching his head. And the Tomb Kings… he'd been warned about them. Don't get involved.\par
Though… it was kind of a low thing that Javier did, ambushing her like that, wasn't it? Then again—for all Zane knew, she could be a terrible person, and Javier was exacting justice or something.\par
All Zane really knew was that she was beautiful and he was part of a gang. Which was a pretty darn shallow set of facts to go off of. Just superficial appearances, really. She could even be a cartel member for all he knew. Maybe this was a gang war.\par
… Zane looked at her. She didn't really scream 'cartel gangster.'…\par
He stood there, torn.\par
He was getting a little itchy, which was a bad sign. \par
Best not to involve himself in other people's messes, he told himself yet again, like a mantra. Especially when it could put his own Faction at risk. That wasn't what he was here for. Really, this was none of his business… \par
…\par
God, he wanted to, though. Watching someone get ambushed and butchered right in front of him made him uncomfortable, sure—even if he didn’t know the circumstances. But it was more than that, he told himself—and it was true. Javier fought beautifully, passionately—Zane really wanted to fight the man. The thought had him panting. He just knew it would be a great fight.\par
He'd have to make a choice very soon. This was getting brutal…\par
He shuffled nervously. He tapped his wrist just to make sure his Signal Blocker was still there. He took a step... \par
Then Vanessa chose for him.\par
She threw out one last blast. And she ran. Fleeing across the lake's frozen surface, across the bay… toward Zane, as luck would have it. He didn't think she even knew where she was going; she was stumbling, totally out of it.\par
She collapsed facedown in the snow in a bleeding heap. Not twenty paces from him.\par
And there came Javier, striding across the ice. He stopped in the middle of the lake. He and Zane locked eyes. \par
"…You saw all that, huh," he said. Even his voice—measured, smooth. \par
Zane shrugged. He felt a little tingly. \par
Javier pursed his lips. Then sighed. "That's unfortunate." \par
He reached into his suit pocket and pulled out a handkerchief. Then, slowly, methodically, he started wiping the blood off his crescent knives. The same knives he'd used to butcher a World Ranker 3 Levels higher than Zane. \par
"That was a dangerous thing you saw," Javier continued. He smiled wanly. "If word reaches her mother, I'm afraid I won't live out the month." \par
"So you'll have to kill me, then," said Zane. \par
Javier shrugged. \par
Zane was flooded with relief. \par
Oh well. He supposed he'd have to save this girl. And fight this awesome World Ranker. It just couldn't be helped. \par
\par


\section{74. Winter Overworld (IV)}
\par
Zane identified Javier.\par
Javier Mendes\par
Essence Level 90\par
Signature Title: Sage of the Crescent Moon\par
Class: Deathstalker\par
Faction: Tomb Kings\par
Laws:\par
Major of Shadow Weaving (Elemental Law of Darkness)\par
Major of Absolute Sharpness\par
Key Skills:\par
Crescent Moon Slash (Active) [Epic]: An ethereal slash with the essence of the moon—unerringly accurate and lethal when struck. Power scales with Level.\par
Shadow-Weave (Active) [Signature]: Allows the wielder to bend shadows to their will, to use as shields or as tunnels. \par
Prism Slash (Active) [Signature]: The wielder's strikes split into other strikes, splintering like the moon's reflection on a rippling pond, dealing several times more damage.\par
Sage Mind showed him Javier's weaknesses. They were oddly few for a human. The throat, a few dots on the skull. That was it. The rest of Javier's body was one blank slate… was it some Skill?\par
Or could it be that suit of his? Something told Zane it wasn't any normal suit. It had taken some of Vanessa's icicles head-on—and there wasn't a scratch on the thing.\par
"So," said Javier, "What is your name? Tell me." He spoke with a faint Spanish accent.\par
Zane stayed quiet.\par
"Come now," said Javier. He smiled. "Don't be shy. My name is Javier, but you can call me Javi. I am a Marquis of the Tomb Kings Faction. It is a pleasure."\par
“…”\par
Javier chuckled. He'd finished wiping off the knives. He carefully pocketed his bloody handkerchief. "My friend, you are going to die. Don't stand on ceremony now. Won't you tell me your name? After you are gone, I will send your mother flowers."\par
"Are we just going to talk?" breathed Zane, grinning. "Or will you fight me?"\par
Javier blinked— for a second, he looked taken aback, then he laughed. "A man of few words. Very well!"\par
His knives materialized in his hands, and he bowed. "Let me bid you good night."\par
He lunged.\par
He didn't even deign to use a Skill, just pure speed. He was at Zane's throat like a flash of moonlight. His knives arched up—\par
Clang!\par
Sparks flew as Crescent steel met the flat side of a glowing Axe head. It took just a thought for Zane to summon. And even that almost wasn't fast enough.\par
Zane caught the surprise on the man's face. Then—Rising Sun Slash!\par
A brutal red line blasted his knives aside; it raced for Javier's throat—\par
The knives spun right back and caught the strike on their shining edges. An explosion rocked the air. Javier was blasted back; he flipped like a gymnast and landed nimbly on two feet. His wicked knives smoked at the edges.\par
His face changed. His eyes narrowed. "Who the hell are you?" he said softly.\par
Zane would've thought the Chains gave it away. But this Javier was from down South—maybe news of him hadn't spread that far.\par
The man's eyes turned calculating. "You're a World Ranker."\par
Zane shrugged.\par
"Who sent you?" Javier demanded. "The Cartel? The Russians?"\par
"You talk too much."\par
Javier laughed. "Fine, then." He smiled, but there was no humor in it. "I will cut the truth out of you!"\par
He slashed.\par
And it was like watching the moon fall out of the sky, growing impossibly big, hurtling straight for him.\par
He'd seen what happened when Vanessa met force with force. He gave a Volt Step, skidded out of the way—\par
It swerved gently and struck him anyway.\par
A thin line of pain dug down his ribs. Then splintered inside of him. One slash turning to four, turn to eight, laden with thick Laws of Sharpness. It had to be for how deep it cut. By the time it fizzled out, it'd sunk deep into muscle.\par
Then Javier was in his face slashing again, shockingly fast.If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
Zane blasted a Rising Sun Slash right back at the man, but he flowed like moonlight rippling—he wasn't there to be hit. A fresh pain stabbed down Zane's other side. He whirled around. And took a slash down his back for his trouble.\par
Zane tried getting him back, tried swiping with his Axe, but it just felt like the wrong thing to do. He felt like he was trying to swat a swarm of angry wasps—they stung him up the legs, up the arms, through the belly, whistling like flutes as they passed.\par
At least with Zane's body, they did little more than wasp stings. And Fiery Renewal was already burning up, healing him fast.\par
Javier frowned. He looked at his knife, then at the wounds it'd made. He'd butchered Vanessa with ease, opening up huge gashes, but on Zane they were little more than flesh wounds. "Your body," he muttered. "Strange… it is like cutting Spirit Steel."\par
He couldn't know how accurate his guess was.\par
Then he shrugged. He was back to smiling. "It does not matter how many cuts it takes. I will put you down, as the hunters do the elephant."\par
Then he vanished, and the storm fell again. The man was just too fast. By the time Zane threw, he was already gone. Already making his next bloody mark.\par
Zane had to time him—he watched the man move, lashed out as soon as he came in—\par
That felt wrong, too, even before he threw it. Somehow he knew it wouldn't work. Sure enough—still too slow. A bloody cross carved up his belly.\par
So Chains were a bust. What about... Lighting Laws gathered at his feet—Javier saw. The man vanished. He was suddenly a dot fifty paces away. And when Zane Volt Blitzed, he hit nothing but shadow. The man had Shadow-Walked out again.\par
It wasn't just his dexterity. His reaction time was nuts.\par
No time to think. A new line of pain tore up Zane's back. Drat.\par
Warning! Health Under 75\%!\par
It was silly. He knew he had the power. He was pretty sure he could mess the man up if he got in a good punch to the face. He just had to land it—and he couldn't. Everything he threw just felt wrong.\par
Fiery Renewal kept him afloat. It mended the deepest of the wounds, kept him mobile. It replenished his health. But not fast enough. The knives just kept coming, one after another…\par
The man was a puzzle.\par
Yet it was the weirdest thing—Zane hadn't gotten a single clean hit on him. But he felt he was making progress? He wasn't sure why. He was kind of getting his ass handed to him so far, admittedly—but…the puzzle felt clearer and clearer.\par
Javier did it all almost at arm's length. Close enough to swipe, close enough to touch. When Zane reached, he bounced a little farther back—and carved Zane up as he passed by.\par
He tried tangling Javier in Chains. He tried feinting the man out. He tried setting up a Cyclone. Nothing got within a foot of him.\par
White fires were burning all over Zane now. They couldn't quite keep up with the damage. He felt kind of like a sinking ship. It might be a while before he went down, but he was slowly, surely going…\par
"Impressive," said Javier. He whistled, inspecting Zane, and shook his head. "I have put enough damage in you to put down a C-ranked boss… how are you still breathing?"\par
Zane stood there bleeding, heaving.\par
"Well," said Javier, shrugging. "I can do this all day."\par
Zane could probably stay afloat a while longer. Nowhere near all day, though.\par
Well, that was most of the tricks in Zane's bag. What else could he try?\par
Hmm.\par
He licked the blood out of his mouth.\par
"Oh?" Javier cocked a brow. "You can still smile in a time like this?"\par
How did Zane win any fight? It wasn't by planning, or even logical thinking—he wasn't like Reina, with all her pre-made strategies. He just… found stuff. Mid-fight. Stuff that came to him. It was intuition...\par
Javier smiled himself. "Let us see if you are still smiling when I have you on your knees, hmm?" His knives started twirling again, making that eerie flute noise. "When I cut your eyes from their sockets, hmm?"\par
That was it. It was all about feeling. Really, that was his whole life was about. Chasing feeling.\par
A thought hit Zane so hard he literally jerked, like he'd been struck by lightning.\par
"I… have to stop trying," he breathed.\par
Javier blinked. Then laughed. "You have lost so much blood you have gone mad, my giant friend! Ah. Let me put you out of your misery."\par
Once more he lunged—and carved a blood gash down Zane's side…\par
And Zane just stood there. Staring, almost limp. Starting to unfocus a little.\par
Why was he fighting like this? Throwing everything at the wall and seeing what stuck? That was blind flailing. He was chasing after shadows. He didn't even know what he was aiming for. It worked for most Monsters, to be fair—because… frankly, Zane's body was better than theirs. He could get away with things. Not against this man.\par
He gave up trying to land a hit. First he had to learn what he was dealing with. He had to know, to see the shape of the puzzle. The moment he had the thought, it just felt right.\par
Sage Mind told him Javier's weaknesses. And Skills. But that was like showing Zane the sword and the armor—it told him nothing about the man wielding them.\par
To hit him, Zane had to know Javier. And while Zane was throwing, and lunging, and spinning, he wasn't focusing.\par
So he just did what felt right to him. He opened his mind. Almost like he was opening his mind to Laws. And he tried to comprehend.\par
Javier laughed carefree as he dug into Zane cut after cut; blood poured out of him in rivers… Zane blinked at him. Saw him. The way he moved. The way essence flowed through his body. Even the way he smiled. He was starting to unfocus, weirdly, in Zane's mind.\par
Even Zane wasn't sure what he was doing anymore. It just felt right. God knew if Zane had one superpower, something that stretched from his life, to his Laws, to his fighting, it wasn't thinking. Or even determination, though he knew he had that too. It was instinct—it was his feeling, married with cold-blooded execution. He went back to what he was best at.\par
Warning! Health Under 50\%!\par
Savage Body activated…\par
The notifications floated past him. He was a little too far gone to even register it. Moonlight flashed before his eyes.\par
He hardly saw Javier at all—the flesh of him. There was a crack. The skin…peeled away.\par
Then Zane saw the colors that made him.\par
He saw Javier's Dark Laws brimming on his knife, like smoldering shadows. But more than that, he saw the colors of the man's soul. The way colors led to action. How that bloody deep red lit up when he slashed, cooled off when he pulled back…\par
It wasn't telepathy, Zane felt, but it was close to it— it almost felt like they were one, somehow, in that moment. Zane just… got a feel for him. Comprehended him, somehow. He wasn't sure if he was delirious or if he'd really—\par
Skill up!\par
Sage Mind I -> II\par
“…”\par
Wait. Sage Mind… the description popped up.\par
Deconstructs the enemy, gaining deep insights into their powers and weaknesses.\par
That made sense, actually…\par
"Have you truly given up, friend?" cackled Javier. He left a vicious tear down Zane's thigh; Zane sank to a knee.\par
Warning! Health Under 25\%!\par
The weirdest thing was, Zane knew he was going to do it. He felt the way intent led to action. It wasn't premonition, just… connection. He saw the puzzle. He saw how to solve it.\par
"Fight the good fight! Go out like a man!" said Javier, leering. He was relaxed. Expecting nothing. He really did think Zane was done. "What a sad—"\par
His face exploded.\par
It happened like this. He leaned in close. And Zane just… put his fist exactly where his face would be.\par
He knew Javier wanted to mock him; he knew he'd be looking up at him. So he threw an uppercut, just under the man's line of sight. And… it hit him. Right in the chin. He threw it pretty darn hard, too—he felt a lot of stuff breaking.\par
Zane blinked down at his fist, then at the man's howling writhing body.\par
…Huh.\par


\section{75. Winter Overworld (V)}
\par
Javier scrambled up. His face was pretty badly broken. He was a lean man, quite angular, without a lot of fat in his cheeks. So you could see very clearly one side of his face was quite different from the other. A lot more droopy and bent.\par
He was pretty angry about it, too. Zane felt anger pouring off him like heat. Rogues like him were very fast, but their Vitality—usually not great. They weren't the strongest.\par
And Zane was one of the strongest people in the world. His fist, Javier's face—very bad combo.\par
Javier screamed. He lunged for Zane's throat in a rage, knives swinging.\par
Zane had loved watching those old martial arts movies with Bruce Lee and the like. They fought prettily, fluidly—almost like a dance. When Zane got into MMA, he found out that real life wasn't like that, sadly. Too messy. That kind of cool Kung Fu mostly worked if fights were choreographed.\par
For instance, if a guy was coming at you with a knife—a guy who was much faster than you, mind you—stopping it by trying to catch his hand at the wrist was probably a very bad idea.\par
But this fight was choreographed for Zane, pretty much. He knew how the other guy was going to move. So he just moved in sync.\par
Javier stared dumbly. He couldn't seem to understand the massive fist swallowing his wrist. Then it twisted and he cried out, dropping the knife. More bones crunched.\par
Zane felt two feelings in Javier's mind then—first utter bafflement. Then overwhelming pain. He screamed. Eyes brimming with tears, he leaped back, trying to put some space between them. And tripped.\par
Zane felt where he was going to go before he went there. So he just casually put a Chain in the way. And Javier fell backward, smashing into the ice.\par
"What?!" slobbered the hitman. He blinked down at the heavy black links wrapped around his ankle.\par
Shadows poured at his feet; he tried to walk out. Then stiffened.\par
Zane had shocked him. Hard enough his concentration broke.\par
The Skill vanished.\par
Javier tried again. And at the moment the shadow coalesced, right when his mind was most vulnerable, Zane shocked him again. And broke him.\par
"What is this devilry?!" He choked.\par
Zane calmly strode up to him and smiled. "I can feel you," he explained. Then, just to prove it—"You're confused. Now you're getting scared. You're starting to panic." \par
Zane scratched his head. "Oh. I wouldn't reach for that if I were—"\par
"DIE!" shrieked Javier. He lunged like only a desperate animal could, knives flailing, eyes bulging.\par
Going wild mostly worked because of the element of surprise. You shocked the opponent with sudden aggression. The problem? It was stupid. From a technical perspective, that was. Go all in on offense, and you leave yourself open to getting hit in the face.\par
Unfortunately for Javier, Zane was not at all surprised. In fact, his fist had been wound all the way back, waiting for just this moment.\par
He leaned to the side. Not too much, not too little, just enough—so close that the gleaming tips of those knives passed within an inch of his eyeballs.\par
At the same time, his fist began a long migration. First it was wound all the way back, almost touching the ground, and a flame lit up as though on an oil-soaked torch. Then it came up and over like a great wheel turning, making a bigger, brighter, hotter crescent that dwarfed the little thing Javier threw. \par
It came right over the top. The poor man didn't even see it coming until it was right on top of him. It dropped like a sledgehammer onto his ruined face and completed its great arc at last.\par
If you really wanted to hurt someone, you didn't end the punch at their face. Zane threw that like there was a brick wall a few feet behind Javier's head and then wanted his fist to break it. His hands were the size of Javier's face. His knuckles mapped a route from chin to brow, and every bone in between shattered. At once. \par
Then it just. Kept. Going.\par
Javier's body slammed over the surface of the icy lake, skidded 20 feet, and jolted to a halt. Since Zane's Chain was still latched around his ankle.\par
To Zane's surprise, the man was still alive.\par
He was so close to dead—his soul felt like a little candle's flicker in a harsh wind—Zane wasn't sure you could call him alive. But he was moving. His face… you definitely couldn't call that thing a face anymore. It was screaming something at him. But all the muscles there were so ruined all that came out was incoherent anguished babbling.\par
Kind of a pity. The man had been such a smooth talker. He'd mocked Zane so casually. \par
Javier crawled up to his arms, reached down to his bag of holding, fumbling for something. He was desperate to escape. He brought it out—a C-ranked escape portal.\par
He was just about to throw it when Zane yanked, and it fell out of his grip. His body came flying back…\par
Zane wound his fist back like he was pitching a baseball. And swung.\par
The speed of the ball that came off of Javier's shoulders would have made some MLB pitchers proud, he felt. It went pretty far too, almost to the island before it dissolved to white light and flowed back into him.\par
The body slumped to the ground. And dissolved to nothing. \par
Level Up!  \par
Essence Level 83 -> 84If you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\par
Zane stood there and sighed happily. \par
Nice. \par
The sun was starting to set. The sky was lit a vibrant orange, shading to gray as it met the horizon. It poured over the crater's edges, shading in the trees, giving the whole frozen lake a pretty new sparkling coat… under this light, the tunnels beneath the ice were even clearer. The murky shapes shifting there glowed the color of sunset.\par
This was nice. He let his heart keep running until it calmed down. He closed his eyes and let out another deep breath… He walked over and scooped up the escape portal. Could come in handy. Javier’s Bag of Holding had little else. More suits, a few Vials of Essence,  various hair gels… the man had packed for a brief trip. \par
Then he turned, and blinked.\par
Oh dear.\par
That girl was still there. He'd totally forgotten about her. She was face down in the snow in a pool of red.\par
… Had she been bleeding the whole time? She was making quite a mess.\par
He scratched his head. … He should probably…. Yeah…\par
He came up close and then gently flipped her over. Her dress was pretty shredded. Everything about her was pretty shredded. It was kind of surprising she was still breathing.\par
He knelt and pressed his hands to her belly. Through that touch, he channeled Fiery Renewal.\par
White flames poured into her. There was still so much dark essence lurking in her. The white burned it out. It started up all over her, cradling her in a gentle warm brace. Her muscles began to mend. Her skin slowly stitched up.\par
It was a lot harder to heal when it wasn't on himself, he found. A lot of essence was lost in the transfer. He wasn't a healer. He knew Reina, or someone specialized, could have done a much better job of it. But he tried his best.\par
And it turned out to be enough.\par
Within a quarter-hour, he was reasonably sure he had restored her. Where his hands touched, there used to be a mangled mess. Now there was a toned belly curving up to a full chest, rising and falling. Where there were cuts, they was now smooth skin. He inspected her face and saw a faint blush of health on her cheeks.\par
She was stunningly pretty, but in an objective way. The kind of pretty where even if she wasn't your type, you'd be forced to admit, yeah, she's absolutely gorgeous. If you showed her face to a hundred people, a lot of them, maybe most of them, would say she was prettier than Reina.\par
For Zane it was no contest. He far preferred Reina—which was a weird thing to think about right now, he knew. When he looked at Vanessa, he was just reminded of how much he missed being with Reina. \par
Something was up with him.\par
Her eyes snapped open. They were startlingly blue. For a moment their gazes met, then—\par
She cried out and thrust her hands right into Zane's chest. He felt a massive blast of cold essence, and he was sent flying, hacking out snow. \par
Then he blinked.\par
He found himself stuck to a tree. Rather—frozen to a tree. He couldn't seem to move. His whole body up to his neck was encased in thick ice.\par
Then something shone right in his face. The bright blue crystal at the tip of a staff. A staff wielded by one Vanessa Volkova, eyes narrowed at him.\par
"Pervert!" She snarled. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't turn you into a statue."\par
She spoke with a fancy British accent, which somehow took a little edge off the threat.\par
Zane wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. "It's not what it looks like—"\par
"Then what were you doing?"\par
The crystal prodded him in the cheek, making him turn his face.\par
"You were blacked out," he said, a little miffed. "I helped you. I healed you—look at your wounds."\par
She did look down, checking her arms, her belly. When she looked back up, she was uncertain. "Well then. What happened to the Marquis? Don't lie. I'll know."\par
"I killed him."\par
"You? Killed a Marquis of the Tomb Kings?" She looked like she found the idea laughable. "And how'd you manage that, Magic Mike? By sitting on him?"\par
She had a very mean-girl smirk. But at least she wasn't outright hostile now.\par
"I did. Kill him, I mean. Not sit on him," said Zane helplessly.\par
"Right. And I'm the queen." She pursed her lips. “Hold on. I remember you. You were watching me earlier, weren't you?"\par
"I—"\par
"Who are you really? Did my mother send you?"\par
That crystal pressed into his face again, flaring bright.\par
"Please don't do that," sighed Zane. "And no. Why would I know your mother?”\par
She pressed it in harder. "I told you not to lie to me!"\par
Zane was done with this. \par
He flexed all his muscles at once. And all that ice shattered.\par
Vanessa had a moment to gasp. She threw out her staff, but he grabbed it and wrenched it out of her hand. Then he had her wrists pinned above her head against the tree. His body crushed close to hers so she couldn't try anything funny. They came face to face.\par
She was fairly tall for a woman, almost six feet. Zane was fairly tall for anyone, and he might as well have been two of her in width. He dwarfed her. He stared down at her straight in the eyes. And she could only stand there, stunned, helpless as he leaned over her. She was wide-eyed. Her mouth hung slightly open.\par
"Enough," he growled. "I don't care whether you believe me or not. You just woke up. You're confused. I can understand why you'd attack me. But do it again, and I won't be so gentle. Got it?”\par
She was flushed all of a sudden. He thought there might be a fight.\par
Then, to his surprise, the fight just… went out of her. She sagged. She nodded. "Okay," she said in a small, soft voice. \par
This time, before he released her, he reached out to her soul—just to make sure she wasn't going to attack him again.\par
He found she was shocked, partly. But most of her mind was swelling with… weird feelings. \par
 … He did not need to know that.\par
But. Uh. He was pretty sure she was not going to attack him.\par
… They were oddly close, weren't they? And this position… he could kind of see why this would give off a weird impression. He let go of her and she just slid down the trunk, like she lost all muscle control in her legs. She sat there red-faced, looking dazed. \par
Disturbed, he started walking away.\par
Then, about thirty paces later—\par
"How—how dare you!"\par
Oh bother. He just kept walking. \par
He heard her running after him. "Wait!" \par
He didn't stop. Then a shadow flew overhead, and she dropped to a halt right in front of him. She wasn't dazed anymore—still red-faced, though. She looked equal parts angry and embarrassed. \par
"You were telling the truth."\par
"It doesn't matter," said Zane, exasperated. He tried stepping past her. She blocked him. \par
"It matters to me." She crossed her arms and sniffed. "I…apologize." \par
She still somehow managed to sound kind of pretentious.\par
"Sure." \par
He made to step around her again, and she got in his way again. "I said, wait!"  \par
"What now?" \par
She thrust something at him. It looked like an egg sculpted of ice. A dense mist was trapped inside it. \par
Egg of the Phoenix of Falling Snows (B) \par
A legendary treasure of the Isle of Falling Snows. If left untouched, this egg will spawn the Boss Phoenix of Falling Snows. Contains a vast amount of essence, as befitting the legendary bird. \par
"There," she said, still pink-faced. "Now we're even. I'm off to the Second Floor. Don't get in my way!” \par
Chin held high, she walked away. \par
\par


\section{76. Winder Underworld (I) }
\par
He considered the Egg. Then he found a quiet spot in the woods, sat down, and started drawing out its essence. \par
Its essence was laced with Ice Law. If Vials of Essence felt like warm broth for the soul, this felt like a cold shake. It took a while to go down. He was a little overeager with it at first, and he got a strange shivering shock. Brain freeze? Soul freeze?\par
So he took it slow and just kept sipping.\par
Soon enough—\par
Level Up! \par
Essence Level 85 -> 86\par
About half an hour later—\par
Level Up! \par
Essence Level 86 -> 87\par
Then the Egg went dull.\par
Satisfied, he stood. Second floor time. But first… \par
He set out across the ice, heading for the island in the middle of the frozen lake. This time no one was there. As he got close, he made out frozen waterfalls pouring down little stone hills and a thicket of snow-laden trees. \par
Cavern of Insight: Icicle Isle Sanctuary (B) \par
This Treasure Area's grade began at E and increased by one grade every thousand years. Like strata in a canyon, the ice in this sanctuary is a time capsule. It holds memories crossing millennia. An invaluable resource for those studying the Laws of Ice.\par
As he got close, the air grew thick with cold mist. Laws so dense they were nearly corporeal. \par
It felt like he'd crossed into some kind of icy wonderland. Thick blocks of ice rose at the Isle's center, a little Stonehenge of pure ice. Trapped in them were all kinds of odd fish. Some huge and gray, leather-skinned, with long flat noses. Some tiny and colorful, shimmering softly in the pale light. You'd never think they were from the same body of water. \par
They were, if you believed the description. Just from different times, different epochs. It was like time stopped here, frozen in ice. He was the only thing that moved.\par
He was sure this place was very valuable to the right person. But to him it was just a pretty stop. It was no use to him right now—and not just because he was exhausted.\par
Something about this place made him uncomfortable.\par
As he stepped, the mists wafted away from him as though repelled. The thought of taking them in made him faintly nauseated.\par
There was a dissonance. The Laws diverged. Fire and Ice did not agree with each other. Somehow Fire, Electricity, and Steel all felt friendly. But Darkness, Ice… they felt far away. Like Yin and Yang, or something. \par
He felt eventually, if he tried hard enough, he could probably grasp hold of a few Ice Laws. It'd just be grueling to use. It wouldn't work with the rest of him.\par
Right now, at least. One day, though.\par
These Laws… they felt to him like part of a bigger puzzle. A puzzle bigger than the puzzle he was trying to solve right now. He had to solve this one before he got to that one. \par
He took note of this Cavern of Insight, just like he'd done with that Sharpness one way back when. For now, he'd focus Fire, Electricity, and Steel. \par
The sun was setting. He walked back to shore, found a nice bed of snow, and sprawled on top of it. He was out in minutes.\par
*** \par
He woke up hugging a fallen branch.\par
He frowned at it, then he realized what he was doing. He was just so used to Reina being there…\par
He sighed. \par
Second floor time.\par
The stairs icon was in the middle of the lake, not far from the Isle. It was a spiral staircase corkscrewing deep into the ice, far out of sight. He heard shouts as he neared the entrance. He looked up.\par
 There was a wide arc of white dots splayed out against the far shore. Watching, some shouting, cheering, waving at him. The Factions he'd met yesterday.\par
He just gave them a thumbs-up. Could they even see from out there? Whatever. He started down the stairs.\par
A bunch of neatly cut, long, slippery ice slabs, one after another. The ice walls let in the morning sunlight in bent, abstract streaks. It was like going down some very inhumane aquarium exhibit. Fish crowded around the stairwell, staring sightlessly. It was kind of eerie—the stairs cut straight through a school of them. For a few yards, he was lost in glimmering red scales. He passed a narwhal-like thing with glossy yellow eyes as big as he was. He could swear they swiveled to watch as he went.\par
It wasn't long before the staircase opened into a craggy, wide tunnel, and he was in the second floor proper.\par
Up ahead, the tunnel split in two. One going left, one right.\par
The one going left had tunnels on tunnels on tunnels. It just kept branching, seemingly forever. He saw ghostly ape-like shapes drifting about, dragging their knuckles on the ground. Flashes of bright blue lit up a branch in the far distance. A fight? Unauthorized duplication: this tale has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\par
It had to be Vanessa.\par
Then there was the tunnel going right. Instead of a bunch of narrow tunnels, it opened up to a huge cavern. Then another, and another still, going down one straight path, all linked.\par
One of these must be going to that Frost Giant. And the other the Leviathan Glacier Whale.\par
He scratched his head. Then he went right.\par
Not a hard choice. Vanessa seemed not to like him. And he just liked working alone.\par
The cavern was a giant underground—under-ice?—lake. Its walls were the same pure ice, lightly reflective, giving a blurry view of the world above. Ice floes drifted about from one end to the other, making a makeshift path across the water. There was a tunnel down the other end… \par
You have entered: Monster House (C+)\par
What? \par
Monster Houses contain an unusual number of unusually strong Monsters. Their strength lies between minion and Boss. Your task is to slay every Monster in the House. \par
Clearance Reward: 1 B-Grade Treasure, tailored to you by the System. \par
Accept? \par
This was new. He squinted down at the water and saw massive dark shapes swirling far beneath… \par
Glacial Orca (Monster)\par
Essence Level 78 \par
Law: Minor Law of Deep Freeze \par
Key Skills: \par
Blizzard Burst (Active) [Uncommon] \par
Unleashes a powerful burst of icy energy from its blowhole, creating a localized blizzard. \par
Icebreaker Bite (Active) [Epic] \par
Bites down with incredible force, enough to rupture a glacier.\par
These sounded pretty fun. He accepted. Ethereal blue light walled off the tunnel behind him and the tunnel ahead. \par
Lair Lock: Monster House\par
He'd just beaten a Level 90 World Ranker. He figured he could drub a few whales pretty easily. \par
Only, how was he meant to actually fight these things?\par
Something was odd about this water… Zane stuck a finger in it. Frost instantly started creeping up the digit, and he jerked it out.\par
He hadn't really thought about the logistics of fighting underwater. It'd seemed pretty fun, but now that he was here… hmm.\par
His new body was great for a lot of things. Swimming was very much not one of them.\par
Eh.\par
He didn't need to go to them. He figured if he just stood there long enough, they'd come to him. The rest… he'd figure it out. He was pretty good at that. \par
So he took a couple hops down the ice floats until he landed at one just about in the middle.\par
Already the shapes took notice. They were swirling up to the surface. And fast. The floes began to teeter as the lake grew turbulent, shaking with waves… \par
He grinned. Then he reached out with his soul just to see, and felt the whirlpool of minds rushing up to meet him.\par
He recoiled.\par
He could instantly tell these things were different. There was something there, but it wasn't a soul like a human soul—it felt tainted somehow, stained with a deeply dark energy. At its core, there was this incredible lust for destruction. For violence. The moment the Orcas sensed him, he felt hatred spiking in them.\par
They hated everything that lived.\par
The water began to tremble all around him. He saw fins big as sails rising to the surface. He got out a Chain—and almost flipped his ice barge wholesale. He had to de-summon it to right the float.\par
He was stable for all of a second.\par
Then he felt a hateful mind rushing up right under him. He leaped straight up. \par
A sleek torpedo of a head blasted straight through the barge, rising fast out of the water, glistening with frost. Inky jaws unhinged, lined with rows of knifelike teeth. \par
He fed the Monster his Axe.\par
It was like dropping an anchor right through the beast's body. It carved through the throat, down its intestines, and it choked on tons upon tons of flaming steel. An explosion rocked its insides. It fell away, tiny eyes rolling back.\par
Then Zane was falling. And he had nowhere to land. And no less than three of the beasts were rising out of the water now, trying to crunch up a piece of him.\par
Shit.\par
He whacked one out of the air, got his Axe deep into the fin of another.\par
The third clamped its jaws around his waist and dragged him under.\par
He felt a shock of freezing water, water that sank its cold fingers deep under his skin, prying for his muscles, for his organs. And his Steel didn't protect him. He tried flailing for the surface—it was no use. He couldn't lift off. He was just too dense.\par
All the while those massive jaws tore into him with a huge force. Enough to chew through the hull of a tanker ship, probably. But not his body. It sank an inch into his arms and belly. Still deep enough to draw blood. And the others swarmed in…\par
Rising Sun Slash!\par
His arm moved so slow down here. And something about this water smothered his Laws. It took a huge effort to get it going—it was a sputter of a slash. It went half as far as normal, and took him almost three times as long to get off. Still enough to rip an Orca clean in two, and slice a flipper off another. \par
Then he felt his body smash into a hard wall. He'd hit lake bottom.\par
The Orcas swarmed around him, screeching so loud it felt like his head might explode, battering furiously at him. A huge one had him by the waist, just burying him down here. They kept pummeling him, spinning him, drive-by blasting him as he tried to right himself. He forgot which way was up. He realized what they were trying to do.\par
His Steel Body made himself stupidly heavy. Then there were the whales weighing on him, sinking their teeth into his ankles, bullying him into the ice…\par
They were trying to drown him.\par
He stopped trying to kick for the surface. Just wasn't working, not with so many of them pummeling him down. He just got out his Axe and buried it deep into the skull of the Orca holding him. Its jaw slackened. \par
Then he swept out in a slow, inevitable arc, and huge gobs of blood spurted into the water.\par
They started rushing him at once, trying to bully him, and he hacked into them, slicing through mouths, ripping up blubber and skin with ease. They couldn't hurt him. And one slice of his Axe could cave those huge skulls in. The only thing was, down here, in this cold, everything was so slow. He had to go one, by one, by one… \par
He was getting lightheaded. \par
He needed air. He had to get through them, then kick for the surface—he looked at his mini-map.\par
Shit.\par
There must've been dozens of dots swarming him. All at once. At this rate he'd run out of breath. Then it wouldn't matter how much power he had. He was done. \par
He was getting a little frustrated. It felt like the story of his life lately. He had all the power he needed. He just couldn't use it! Not in time, at least. If only there was some way he could get them all at once. If only his Electric Laws were strong enough... but two Minor Laws, against all that Major Ice Law in the water--and he didn't even have a Skill to apply them. What could he do? \par
…Wait. \par
Could you start a firestorm underwater? ...Logically, the answer was no.\par
Fuck it. \par
He got out his Axes. \par
\par


\section{77. Winter Underworld (II)}
\par
Zane had a theory.\par
…Maybe "theory" was giving himself a little too much credit. Really it was more of a hope.\par
If he poured in enough power, he could throw all logic out the window.\par
He had a lot of essence. Even he wasn't sure how much. He'd never come close to truly exhausting himself. These Orcas kept hitting him, spinning him around and bowling him over—but that was it. They were annoying, but they couldn't actually hurt him. \par
He had more strength in an arm than these things had in their whole bodies. If he wanted to make a Cyclone, could any of them stop him?\par
Time to find out. \par
His Axes began to spin. Essence gushed through him, coursing with Laws of Fire.\par
His Chains wound their way into motion. Sparks began to fly.\par
Ice Laws smothered his Chains, smothered his Axes. It felt like he was trying to force them through mud. They sparked and sparked—but they couldn't take flame.\par
One. One horribly slow, frozen revolution.\par
The Orcas could tell he was up to something. They rammed harder into him, started sinking their teeth into his arms, huge tails flapping ferociously, making whirlpools, straining with all the might of those giant heaving bodies. He roared soundlessly, bubbles leaking from his lips, and wrenched his arms on. Just brute-forced the stupid thing through.\par
Still too slow. \par
He had to give it more. His Cyclones burned on his essence. His fires lit on his essence. He shoved more in—as much as he could bear at once. His head was getting light.\par
Two. Flames sputtered down the Chains, sputtered up the Axe-head; barely there, tiny against the vastness of the cold, but they were there. The edges of the Axes started glowing, going deep red to bright yellow, verging on white. His whole body screamed with the brunt of it. He forced another cycle through.\par
Three! Now things were really heating up. The water around the flames started to warm, started to boil as Zane's Laws poured out, burning away those Ice Laws, burning out the dark blue cold. His Chains caught a smattering of Orcas as they swept through, branding trails of sizzling crimson on sleek black skin. They screeched, flailed away.\par
Four. And now he was really picking up momentum. He could feel his Cyclone getting off the ground. He felt a stab of fierce joy. It spurred him on.\par
But he was fighting the world. He was fighting a whole school of Orcas, trying to pummel him into dust. Fighting this whole lake laden with brutal Ice Laws, mired with essence—made perfectly to counter him. Fighting the dungeon itself, feeding this death trap its powers…\par
And all he had was his body and his essence.\par
He had to believe he could win. \par
Five. He started screaming with the effort; every muscle ran taut; all over his body veins bulged with the effort. The Chains were swirling fast now, slapping whales all over the place. The ones unlucky enough to get in the way of the Axes made quick, brutal, bloody ends. Like hot knives through huge lumps of butter. A few of the Beasts still got through, screeching those nail-on-glass screeches. They tried ramming him, all desperation.\par
But they bounced right off.\par
Zane didn't care about kicking to the surface anymore. His body was one giant chunk of Spirit Steel, held up by two giant Chains just as heavy. He was in motion now. If they couldn't stop him earlier…\par
Another revolution and they were sucked screeching into those boiling, fuming currents. They vanished. Those blooms of red—was that their blood or just more fire, raging faster, brighter, climbing to a fever pitch?\par
Zane lit up the lake bottom. And now the light could not be denied. It was exhilarating.\par
Seven. Eight. \par
He stumbled. Blinked.\par
…There seemed to be black spots dotting his vision. He was getting lightheaded. And not just from a severe lack of air. The power rushing out of him was breathtaking. In a lot of ways.\par
Nine. And the Cyclone broached the surface. He felt it hit air. He felt Scorched Wrath Laws seeping down the length of the lake, burning up every inch of it. And the whole thing began to steam, began to swirl in on itself, bending to the shape of his Cylcone…\par
The whole chamber began to shake.\par
Ten! \par
Everything was blinding now. There was a huge hissing, a huge whooshing as great masses of water turned to steam. All at once. Hundreds of tons of water swirled above him, held aloft…\par
Eleven. \par
He felt drained. He was shocked—a sudden, cloying fatigue was spreading down his limbs, tugging at his eyes, making his thoughts go slow and sluggish. And he realized—with some shock—for the first time, he was feeling his limit. This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
He was getting low on essence.\par
Twelve, and he couldn't see anymore. The world was a mass of steam. He felt the massive load growing lighter, lighter, lighter still…\par
…Where had all those whales gone? All the water? All the ice?\par
He couldn't think. He just had to keep going. Had to—\par
Thirteen, and something snapped.\par
It was him.\par
He dropped, and his head cracked against hard, dry ice.\par
For a few seconds, he just lay there. He couldn't even think. He was just dragging in huge lungfuls of air, trying to blink the black spots out of his eyes. He was so bone-tired there was nothing he could do but lay there, face down, spread out, whole body heaving massively, just trying to breathe. He felt scraped raw from the inside. Utterly wrung out. He had nothing left. He felt he could pass out at any moment.\par
Monster House cleared!\par
He got such a burst of simple joy from seeing that message it almost sent him over the edge.\par
He smiled.\par
It took a few minutes before he was ready to sit back up and assess the damage.\par
He blinked at an empty, rounded chamber—a chamber much bigger, much deeper than he'd thought. The ceiling must be a few hundred feet in the air. And it just went on and on all around him… \par
It was big enough for a school of giant Orcas to live in. He hadn't really appreciated that fact until now. It was like seeing an iceberg once you drained away the water.\par
It had been full of liquid. And ice. And bodies—flesh and bone. Now… nothing.\par
It was like he'd done some kind of weird physics experiment. He'd converted everything in this giant room to gas. Including all the monsters in it.\par
Level Up!\par
Inferno Cylcone III -> IV\par
Neat.\par
He hobbled to his feet. So. His body did have limits. He blinked at the size of the room. He wasn't sure how much essence he'd just used, but…\par
Yeah. It'd make what that Vanessa girl used to kill the Basilisk look like a cantrip in comparison.\par
It was good to know. Unless he planned on evaporating another Arctic Ocean in one go, he probably didn't have to worry about hitting his limits.\par
He scratched his head. Why was his essence pool so abnormally big anyway? His soul was the other thing about him that was abnormally big, physical traits aside—he wondered if they were connected somehow…\par
He got the feeling Avery also had an unusually large soul—though nothing like his. And she could spew essence at her mirages like no tomorrow.\par
Then he got another notification and forgot what he was thinking.\par
Selecting treasure reward…\par
A crystal popped up before him, spinning slowly, shimmering in a halo of warm white light.\par
Recording of the sermon on Pseudo-Stormfire, given by Master Lucian to assorted Elders during the short-lived Fire-Lightning Alliance circa 7th Megannum (B+)\par
In which the Master expounds on Pseudo-Stormfire, his new breakthrough discovery. A carefully guarded secret that made Alliance cultivators who could master it nigh-unbeatable at power levels under Foundation—until the discovery of other such Pseudo-Fusions hundreds of millennia later.\par
Due to its uniquely synergistic properties, Pseudo-Stormfire is one of very few Fusions that can be performed even without full basic Mastery of their respective Elemental Laws. \par
A B+ treasure? It was the highest-grade treasure he'd ever seen. He assumed it meant 'Treasure between B and A', just like C+ Dungeon meant 'Dungeon between C and B'. He was a little shocked he got it in a C+-ranked Dungeon. Had he just gotten lucky with the System's draw or something? \par
And it was tailored just to him, apparently—looking at the Laws, that made sense.\par
He read it over again. It sounded pretty darn cool, though the terms themselves didn't mean a lot to him. \par
Too bad he was too burnt out to use it. He pocketed it for later.\par
He drank in a few lower-grade Vials of Essence. \par
When he recovered fully about an hour later, he made his way over to the exit tunnel some fifty-odd feet off the ground, hopped to it, and kept on moving.\par
The next chamber was studded with yellows—a big treasure area? He poked his way through.\par
Whale Bone Sanctuary (C)\par
A supernaturally powerful flash freeze swept up a lake on the Planet of Thousand Trenches, instantaneously killing everything that lived within. The most powerful of the beasts there became relics, preserved forever in the ice.\par
He emerged at what looked like some half-finished archaeological dig.\par
A set of pale white bones, each big as canoes, lay frozen in the ice, close enough to touch.\par
Spine Shard of the Colossus Whale (B)\par
A rare bone containing the condensed remnants of the essence of a Colossus Whale.\par
They lay scattered across the ice. When he touched them, he could draw out their essence. There were three or four in total. Not enough for a level, but they got him fairly close.\par
There were some other knickknacks. A few C-grade frozen eyeballs that promised to help comprehend Ice Laws. He burned those out of the walls and took them for safekeeping. It was shaping up to be a pretty good haul, even if he couldn't use all of it. \par
What really intrigued him, though, was a black pearl as big as his fist, shining softly in the low light. Spiderwebs of frost smothered its surface.\par
Permafrost Oyster's Pearl (C)\par
Condensed over 300 years by the Permafrost Oyster. The wisdom of the oceans lies within this treasure. Helps heal soul wounds, nourishing and invigorating the spirit.\par
He burned it out and grabbed hold of it. There was a certain dewy, milky essence hidden in this thing. When he drew it out, he felt a sudden burst of clarity, of energy—it was like he'd taken some kind of caffeine shot for the soul.\par
It didn't heal his weariness. He could still feel it dragging at him under the surface. But for just this brief moment, he felt… normal. Better than normal. He dragged more of it in until his head was filled to bursting with it. He felt sharp, clear as a freshwater lake in spring. \par
He couldn't waste this.\par
Instantly, he sat down and grabbed for the recording. He went into it excited.\par
The world around him dissolved, fading out, losing definition…\par
A new world filled in. New colors—rich greens and warm browns—all soaked in a layer of fuzzy white mist. He was looking at a mountain rising out of the mists, one of many quaint, calm peaks flowing into the vague distance. It was picturesque, beautifully simple, like something out of an old Japanese painting. It was early morning. Birds chirped softly.\par
There was a lake at the peak of this mountain, from which waterfalls trickled gently all the way down.\par
And at this peak was the gathering of white-haired folk, most of them sported long, flowing beards. They all wore these silky robes woven of faintly luminous threads. Some were shades of red, some of blue, some of white. The red ones seemed to smolder a little as they moved; the blues and whites crackled softly, like distant lightning. Each was carefully embroidered, sporting a little crest. If you looked at them they seemed to move subtly over the fabric. A bird with an elephant in its claws, flapping its wings. A slowly shifting cloud. A sun rising over the mountains… \par
An Elder stood at their fore on a little wood dais by the lake. He was utterly plain-looking, insignificant except for his eyes, which shone with a burning intensity. He cleared his throat. \par
\par


\section{78. Stormfire (I) }
\par
"Elders of Mount Thundercrest! Elders of the Azure Flame Faction! It is my honor to host you today at this Joint Lecture on the Law."\par
Azure Flame Faction? Wasn't that the same Faction that made the Rising Sun Slash?\par
Elder Lucian clasped his hands behind his back.\par
"I have gathered you here today on Mount Taiji, under arrays of absolute secrecy, to reveal a secret that—without exaggeration—shall upend the foundations of our Factions. A breakthrough I believe will shake the Galaxy for generations to come."\par
Silence greeted his words. The other elders looked at one another, frowning. \par
"Or so you've said," growled an Elder in the middle, squat and bushy-browned. "Let it never be said Sage Noughtfire lacks for ego. You pulled me out of seclusion for this, Lucian! If you've wasted my time—"\par
"I assure you, Elder Rini," said Elder Lucian. His proud eyes flashed with annoyance. "You will be quite satisfied. Shall I continue?" \par
Elder Rini crossed his burly arms and harrumphed. \par
"This secret," continued Elder Lucian. "Should only be disseminated to your most promising young talents. A scant few will ever comprehend it. But those that do shall become unparalleled at their power levels. This secret shall not only strengthen them now, but also put them on the road to becoming true galactic powerhouses! Listen well!"\par
"You know of Stormfire, one of the greatest destructive powers in the universe. It burns what lightning could never shock and shocks what fire could never burn. The perfect fusion of two Elemental Laws—and among the most difficult to achieve. Even among you, your Factions' most venerable Elders—I would guess less than half have managed the feat."\par
At Elder Rini’s indignant expression—“This is no insult.”\par
He held up a hand. It was missing its ring finger and pinky. The stumps smoldered black.\par
"True Stormfire exacts a tremendous price. It took me six centuries of practice to achieve it. I was lucky to leave with only the permanent loss of two fingers… most pay with their lives."\par
The elders there shuffled uncomfortably. Murmurs scattered down the row.\par
"But what if," Elder Lucian continued, "It was possible to achieve Stormfire before the full mastery of Elemental Laws? A version which—while dangerous—is not tantamount to gambling with your life? A stepping stone to Stormfire, if you will?"\par
The murmur ceased. The elders all stared wide-eyed. "Enough!" spat Rini. "Speak!" \par
"Very well. I present to you… Pseudo-Stormfire!"\par
He opened his palm, and something new burned in the center of it. A flame that seemed to buzz, a flame that flickered not like fire but like electricity. It was still the red of fire, but where fire flickered red and yellow, this flickered red and white—a pure white, an electric white. The licks of flames seemed to crackle. They gave off sparks that sizzled and buzzed at once. A burning that shocked…\par
It was pale as it lay in his palm, a ghost of an element. But somehow, even dreaming, Zane felt the effects of it—the heat pouring off it which somehow tingled like electricity. It gave him a hair-raising feeling. Major Laws poured off it, so closely wound you couldn't tell them apart.\par
Gasps rippled down the line of elders. Even Elder Rini seemed flabbergasted. \par
"Indeed," said Elder Lucian dryly, "It is a shadow of Stormfire, true—but it is there. It is real." \par
He paused. "True Stormfire is an esoteric art. Few below great elders of the main Faction ever achieve it—and that is one, of tens of millions! The first great benefit of Pseudo-Stormfire is simply that it is easier to achieve. But it is also a learning tool. Once you know Pseudo-Stormfire—once you climb the levels of mastery—why, it is like ascending rungs on a ladder! By the time you have reached the highest rung, all that is left is to make the final leap. Significantly simpler than leaping from the ladder's bottom, is it not?"\par
"The second great benefit… even at its lowest level, Pseudo-Stormfire allows the Condensation Cultivator to tap into powers far beyond their station! It is fiercer than any fire, more destructive than any lightning. It is by far the strongest single element a cultivator below Foundation can wield… our Factions all suffer from gluts of Cultivators stuck at that first bottleneck from Condensation to Foundation. Even for those with talent, the unlucky may stay stuck at Level 99 for centuries. Perhaps for the rest of their lives! For some, it is not soul talent they lack, but essence talent…Pseudo-Stormfire gives these unlucky souls a power to match their betters. Even at low mastery, Pseudo-Stormfire is equivalent in power to an expression of Elemental Law!"\par
This drew disbelieving mutterings. Lucian's smile tightened. "I would even go as far as to claim that at high mastery, Pseudo-Stormfire exceeds the power of a pure Elemental Law!"\par
"Ridiculous!" cried a tall, fork-bearded elder. \par
"Heresy!" snarled Elder Rini.\par
"Lucian... we have made some allowance for your eccentricities," muttered another elder. "This… this is an achievement, true. But your claim goes too far. What you say goes against universal Law." \par
"So it does," said Lucian. "I humbly suggest, my fellow elders, that your understandings of the Laws of the Universe… are incomplete. I am aware I have made a bold claim. Allow me to offer a demonstration."\par
He pointed a finger at the lake. Stormfire poured out in a thin dazzling line. It touched the edge of the water...A case of content theft: this narrative is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\par
The lake burned.\par
Not a spreading fire. An instantaneous one. None of the lake was burning, and then instantaneously, all of it was. Fire had spread like lightning conducting—and it raged over the surface. Zane knew Laws of Fire, and he could tell they were Laws in that water directly opposed. It didn't matter; the Stormfire burned easily over it anyway. The water was electrocuted—with Fire. \par
In a flash it was over. A cloud of steam rising to the sky. Then nothing.\par
The silence was overwhelming. Even Zane felt the awe. \par
All he could think at that moment was— \par
If only he had this against those damned whales! \par
"That," continued Elder Lucian, "Can only be considered a medium mastery Stormfire, containing the Major Laws of Scorched Wrath, Thermal Dynamics, Arcane Conduction, and Discharge. What single element, esteemed elders, can hope to match it? Water clearly cannot… would you like to offer another?"\par
No one did. Lucian smiled grimly.\par
"This Pseudo Fusion Element," he went on, "Can be used in place of electricity or fire for the vast majority of skills. It is as simple as swapping it in—and it shall upgrade every such skill at least one tier. A Mortal Grade Epic skill becomes a Mortal Grade Legendary. Like that."\par
He bowed. "I must reiterate, however, even Pseudo-Stormfire is not for the faint of heart. Only true geniuses, on par with natives of Ur-Planets, may achieve this! Even then… some may take months or even years to achieve even basic mastery…"\par
His hands clasped behind his back again.\par
"In truth, Pseudo-Stormfire, at its most basic level, can be reduced to just two Major Laws: Scorched Wrath of the Elemental Fire and Discharge of the Elemental Law of Electricity. You can weave in more from there! The conceptual foundations are the same. Both govern the furious explosive hearts of their elements. The same emotion expressed in a different medium. It is this simple initial observation that led me down the long road to Pseudo-Stormfire. From there, I conducted decades of experiments! This is the formula I have distilled. Observe."\par
The Stormfire vanished; in its place lay a simple fireball laden with a familiar Law.\par
"The core is Scorched Wrath. From there, interweave Discharge like a lattice so that it melds into the flames… notice the pattern. Ingrain it in your memories. For it is the crux of Pseudo-Stormfire!"\par
The elder weaved it in with exaggerated slowness, as though Discharge were a needle and he was sewing electricity into the shifting fabric of flame. As he drew it, the air seemed to hum, like the universe itself was pleased with the movement. It was a sublime pattern, looping and swirling and zagging, a collection of perfect geometries. The pattern agreed with nature, somehow. It felt right, right at the level of the soul. It felt to Zane like seeing one of those golden ratio videos back in science class—where you could find the same simple pattern in a sunflower as in the spiral of a galaxy. The pattern was harmony. It erased the difference between fire and electricity, made null the forms, until all that was left was the feeling that animated them both. \par
Elder Lucien wove until the threads were inseparable, until Zane couldn't pick out Scorched Wrath from Discharge… just the fury of them, two, burning as one. \par
Stormfire.\par
Elder Lucian left it burning there. Already the pattern was vanishing from Zane's mind. The elder seemed to want him to memorize it. The rest of the elders frowned at it—they seemed to be trying to. Or maybe they were just in awe. \par
For Zane, it just wasn't happening. Not in a hundred years. He frowned. He thought that was how someone like Reina might learn this Law—it was how Elder Lucien had found it.\par
But Zane just stared at the Stormfire. He felt the way Fire and Lightning played off each other, felt the way they bonded, seamless. He didn't understand why he needed the pattern memorized, at least. Maybe it would have been hard to find his way here if he'd never seen it before.\par
Now that he knew what it felt like, he didn't understand why he couldn't just… feel his way there again? All the pattern did was trace the gap between Fire and Lightning, and in doing, erase it. But he'd felt what they were like together. All he had to do was compare the way they felt apart and feel his way across the difference, right? He probably couldn't memorize the raw shape of it if he tried. It seemed awfully complex… most of the elders there seemed to be struggling with it. Beads of sweat popped up on their wrinkled brows.\par
Was he just not getting something obvious? He scratched his head.\par
Maybe he'd see.\par
Sometimes when he comprehended Laws, he got the vague sense he was doing it the wrong way. At least not the way everyone else did it, the way you were supposed to do it. He seemed to get there just fine anyway most of the time. So he figured he'd just keep doing it.\par
The scene vanished.\par
***\par
But before he could try it, he needed the Major Law of Discharge. So, he got out his Stormheart Crystal and threw himself back into the comprehension.\par
It was a little harder getting to it because—and this was rare for him— he was too excited to settle down at first, to really relax his mind, let it open up. \par
Eventually, a haze of a vision came to him.\par
It was storming, and badly; forks of light flashed through the vast dark. He could hardly see—he was on a mountain somewhere, rain-stricken. Winds lashed the peak, screaming as they went.\par
A duel seemed about to go down. \par
On one side of that peak was a serpent, winding loop of vivid blue. Its eyes were so bright you couldn't even see the pupils, just crevices of light. A trident of horns lay between its eyes.\par
On the other side, crawling down from a massive boulder, there was a serpent outlined in red crackling lightning. A single scimitar of a horn reared out from its head. It screeched a challenge. The blue serpent answered.\par
And they ran together. There was a fury of sound and light, like a cannon's blast. Then they started coiling into each other, intertwining, and then he felt the way their powers shifted, opposing, twining, balancing each other as they fought—until they seemed one huge writhing beast, so tangled there was neither blue nor red, but a vivid purple. Their powers made and unmade each other. Something new was born. And Zane saw it.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Charge Neutralization\par
The scene faded…\par
A familiar fatigue started dragging at him again... He was starting to crash. No good... He ambled his way to the Permafrost Oyster's Pearl and drew out another few drops of it. He had to keep going. \par
He sat back down, squeezed his eyes shut, and started putting it all together. Charge Neutralization, Spark Charge Accumulation… swirling in his mind faster and faster, a buzzing whirlwind of feelings, coming together at the bottom in one fine point—\par
He gasped, shuddered. And opened his eyes.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Major Law of Discharge\par
Now for Pseudo-Stormfire. \par
It wasn't often he was buzzing about learning a new Skill, but he was now.\par
He wondered if he could get it done this session if he drained the Pearl dry. There was the stuff that elder said about taking months or years or whatever, but Zane had heard that before, and it all kind of flew past him now. Nobody he knew took that long to learn a Law or Skill.\par
… Come to think of it, there was that phrase again—'natives of Ur-Planets.' Was that what Earth was?\par
He shook his head. No more drifting. No time. \par
He'd give this thing his best try. He grabbed the Pearl and took a big sip.\par
\par


\section{79. Stormfire (II) }
\par
(2/2)\par
He was exhausted and excited all at once. It was hard to explain—like he was running on fumes, but very hot fumes, the kind that got you all tingly and buzzy in the head.\par
He sank back into the recording and watched the vision over again. By the time he got out of it, his brain felt wrung dry. He wasn't sure he had another watch in him—but he had the feeling now. That he was sure of.\par
All he had to do was reproduce it.\par
He stretched out a giddy hand. And Scorched Wrath flames burst to life on top of it. He drew out the Major Law of Discharge and closed his eyes. Twin feelings raged beside each other. He felt them like pieces of the same puzzle.\par
Now that he'd felt them whole, he knew where one completed the other. He just needed the right position, the right opening. And he could trace the line where they met. The binding pattern.\par
He soon found it—he'd start from the edge and weave his way in. He took a thread of electricity and started winding.\par
Discharge touched Scorched Wrath.\par
And exploded.\par
Then he was face down on the ice, convulsing, hacking up air, then blood. He built his way up to his elbows—elbows with no skin on them, just flesh. Fiery Renewal patched him back up pretty quick but he felt the stinging all over the front of him. The blast had taken off a whole layer of skin.\par
…That wasn't pleasant.\par
It only made him more excited to do it to someone else.\par
He felt a spreading wetness under him. For a moment, he thought he was lying in a pool of his own blood. But no—just a crater in the ice, dissolving to water.\par
He threw himself back into it. He traced a sizzling line through the fire. This time he got a little ways in before he exploded.\par
He only grew more excited. He'd screwed up twice, and already he'd learned so much about what not to do. Which was almost as valuable as learning what to do. He could feel himself getting closer.\par
He went at it again. It felt like sprinting down a winding tightrope of the mind. He had to do it in one mad dash, one go, or he'd fall off. Except he couldn't see the path. He stepped into open unknown air. His only compass was feeling. Zane could see why someone would lose their nerve—it was probably why those elders didn't want to do it. You had to have a steady hand. A steady mind.\par
Something told him they didn't have the kind of intuition he did either.\par
By his fourth explosion—\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%\par
Closer, but still not quite right. The electricity was dancing around the fire, on the outside—weaving on the fringes. He needed it cleaner.\par
By the sixth explosion, he'd gotten it more than halfway, he felt. The fire was flickering like lightning now, burning like fire. But the sparks still weren't quite there. They were embers, not ember-sparks.\par
He blinked and fuzzed out mid-thought.\par
Drat. He could feel himself starting to crash. He grabbed the Pearl and drank the rest of it. Instantly he felt lightheaded, a buzzing rush of energy, and his eyes fluttered back open.\par
Again.\par
And again.\par
And again. Faster, faster—\par
The fires met the lightning at the center of his palm until his eyes started to water, until blood started trickling from his lips, until the two blurred together in his vision...\par
Until he blinked, and the blurs resolved, and he saw them in full. Dancing brilliantly on the center of his palm, a fire brighter than any fire, cackling like lightning.\par
Skill comprehended!\par
Pseudo-Stormfire (Active) [Legendary - Basic Mastery]\par
He grinned a big dumb grin.\par
**\par
Now, what could he do with it? That elder said he could use it on pretty much anything, right? He felt like a giddy kid. What first?\par
He'd try Rising Sun Slash. Seemed the simplest.\par
He gave it a few experimental slashes. First, with basic fire.\par
It wasn't quite as simple as swapping in Stormfire. He tried it. Even he could've predicted the explosion.\par
But it was still much easier than weaving Stormfire in the first place. He frowned, sat down, and focused. It didn't take him long to work out the kinks.\par
Skill evolved!\par
Rising Sun Slash [Epic] -> Rising Storm Slash [Legendary]\par
Now when he slashed, it wasn't just an arc of Stormfire that shot out—brighter, hotter, more explosive than before, sizzling and cackling and buzzing and smoldering, all at once. It also left a groan of thunder in its wake.If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.\par
There were a bunch of puddles around. He chose one ankle-deep, the size of a small swimming pool. It had some Major Laws of Ice swirling within—Laws that had given his Inferno Cyclone some trouble.\par
He threw out a slash just to see.\par
Fire stormed out, rippled across the water lightning-quick, eating it up. The slash was blindingly fast now—and where it passed, water caught fire, kept spreading, kept roasting like it was made of dry wood. Before, it would've fizzled out. His fire might've been weak to water. But water was weak to electricity. And Stormfire had none of fire's weaknesses—but all of lightning's powers.\par
He watched as the flames licked out from the slash, spreading until the whole thing went up, hissing steam like a sudden sauna. No resistance.\par
Man. If he had this slash before the Monster House, he could have just sniped the whales from the surface. Or burned them alive.\par
He couldn't believe this came from only a B+ ranked treasure. This felt really strong.\par
Maybe that wasn't how treasures were graded, though? This was just a recording, after all. What you got out of it depended on you. Some folk would get nothing. Whereas for something like a Vial of Essence, everyone would get a huge influx.\par
Anyway. He was very happy with this new toy. It didn't spread quite as fast as the fire in that vision. That Stormfire had lit up the lake instantaneously—his had to spread. Probably had something to do with that 'Arcane Conduction' Law.\par
He wondered if he could get it from the Stormheart. First he'd get that, then weave Stormfire into his Cyclone, then...\par
... His thoughts were getting sluggish. He frowned down at the Pearl. It was empty.\par
He seemed to be crashing a little. \par
"..." \par
Everything was getting quite blurry. But he wasn't done! \par
"Hmm," he said. And blacked out.\par
**\par
He woke with his face smushed against icy ground, which was getting to be a familiar place for him. It felt like there was a second heart inside his head, a very hot heart, and it wouldn't stop thudding that nauseating beat over and over. Groaning, he tried to get up. This turned out to be a bad idea. He spent the five minutes dry heaving.\par
"Fuck," he groaned.\par
He’d burned out—worse than he’d ever burned out before. He ran out of that pearl juice, and all his fatigue, mounting, put off for so long, finally caught up to him. It felt awful.\par
No more Law. No more. No more comprehension. He didn't even want to think anymore—maybe ever. No think. Must hit things.\par
He crawled to his feet, squinting up ahead. The next tunnel lay open before him, a dark-blue blur in his vision, and he ambled toward it.\par
Sometime later, he came out the other side into blinding light. Far too bright. The shafts of it seemed to streak through his eyes, piercing straight into his brain. He groaned.\par
They were glistening. Sunlight off of ice. He tried to make out the cavern ahead. It was like the cavern before, only he couldn't seem to make out the ceiling. Or the walls. They were lost behind soft walls of mist. Very big place. Very, very big place. No—he made them out now; things were resolving. A very high, vaulted ceiling spiked with icicles. Sunlight came through as though through stained glass, drenching the place in an extraterrestrial blue.\par
Another giant lake lay before him. So giant the edges faded off as a mini-map—at what point does a lake become an ocean? Icebergs bobbed about in the water, and he saw the blurry outlines of massive beasts trapped inside, crusty gray things with skin like some hybrid of dirty ice and rough stone.\par
Glacial Whale Shark (Monster)\par
Essence Level 78\par
Law:\par
Major Law of Deep Freeze (Elemental Law of Ice)\par
Key Skills:\par
Glacial Armor (Passive) [Rare]\par
The wielder gains a thick layer of mystical ice which acts as both armor and a source of power. This armor regenerates over time, making the wielder incredibly resilient to physical and magical attacks. This armor can also be shed in large chunks to be flung at the enemy.\par
Cry of the Arctic Ocean (Active) [Epic]\par
Their maws release a tsunami of Ice, drowning and freezing the enemy. Capable of immense blunt force trauma and freezing damage.\par
They showed up as red dots on his mini-map.\par
Then there was the iceberg in the middle. You couldn't even call it an iceberg, really—something like a glacier, or the world's biggest ice cube. It took up the bulk of the cavern. It must have been half a mile out from him, and it still dominated his sight.\par
And in the center of it…\par
He hadn't seen it at first, partially because it was almost the same color as the ice. But also partly because you see animals by their parts. A fin, a flipper, a head, and you can start piecing them together.\par
When a flipper's the size of a cruise ship, you start to lose all context. Zane had to blink and then turn his head from one side of the room to the next. Zoom out. Only then could he really take it in.\par
It was hard to tell where the ice ended and where its body began. The closest thing he could compare it to was a blue whale—a blue whale the color of ice on an overcast day. Maybe an aircraft carrier? It was almost hard to think of it like a Boss, a thing he was meant to fight.\par
Leviathan Glacier Whale (Monster)\par
Essence Level 89\par
Laws:\par
Major Law of the Tidal Forces (Elemental Law of Water)\par
Major Law of Deep Freeze (Elemental Law of Ice)\par
Key Skills:\par
Cry of the Somber Deep (Active) [Epic]\par
Emits a mournful cry that resonates through water and ice. This sonic wave inspires terror in the enemy while dealing great vibrational damage. The sheer force of it is enough to shatter a glacier.\par
Glacial Armor (Passive) [Rare]\par
The wielder gains a thick layer of mystical ice which acts as both armor and a source of power. This armor regenerates over time, making the wielder incredibly resilient to physical and magical attacks. This armor can also be shed in large chunks to be flung at the enemy.\par
Tidal Surge (Active) [Rare]\par
Creates powerful tidal forces capable of swallowing and crushing entire armies.\par
Whirlpool Maw (Active) [Epic]\par
Summons an immense whirlpool from the wielder's maw, inexorably dragging in all those nearby. This force builds on itself. It is incredibly difficult to resist.\par
Its weaknesses were its eyes. What Zane thought were its eyes, anyway—these two pale discs covered by a huge fleshy flap. And its throat lit up red too. That was pretty much it.\par
He tried using his Sage Mind empathy on the thing, just to see, and felt like a hot whip had lashed him inside his skull, right at the tenderest parts of his brain. He groaned.\par
He was so burnt out he couldn't even use soul-based Skills properly?\par
…Wow.\par
Then one massive eye snapped open.\par
It stared at Zane through the ice.\par
“…”\par
A screech blasted out from that central iceberg and tore through the room, so ferocious, so blisteringly loud everything present trembled. The waters jumped a foot in the air; the walls shivered; the icicles on the ceiling cracked, shivered, threatened to drop. Zane trembled too. He couldn't stop his whole body vibrating.\par
It didn't hurt much. Just felt incredibly odd.\par
Then…\par
Seams lit up on the icebergs. They shattered all at once.\par
And the Whale Sharks inside broke free, crashing into the sea, sending jets of water splashing halfway to the ceiling.\par
They came for him all at once, from all sides, bellowing deep, mouths wrenching impossibly wide. Reams of white gathered deep in their throats, spilling out…\par
Zane got out his Axes. They let up with Stormfire at the edges; they sparked mightily as they dragged against the ice. He loved the new look.\par
He readied Rising Storm Slash just as a world of Ice poured over him.\par


\section{80. Stormfire (III) }
\par
It felt like Zane stood before a blizzard so massive it blotted out his world. This was no ordinary ice. It was woven through with Major Laws. This ice had a chilling deathly touch, and it felt dense as stone.\par
He raised his Chains and slashed. The Axes carved a shining red cross through the white.\par
And slashed it clean open.\par
The white fell away. Red licked down the white—and suddenly the ice storm was going the other way, turning against itself as more and more of it caught fire.\par
The whale sharks screeched louder, blasted harder, but it was like throwing dry wood into a raging bonfire. It just gave his Stormfire more fuel. Gave it a path straight to them.\par
The flame raced down the storm, swallowing as it went, until all Zane could see was swirling flickering red-white until it looked as though the whales were breathing Stormfire instead of ice.\par
Then the fire reached their mouths, reached their throats. And the Monsters burned, started choking on their own essence. They cooked from the inside out.\par
A few were smart enough to choke it off. Those came at him with their massive battering ram bodies, bursting out of the water, trying to crush him.\par
He slashed, slashed again, carved two shining lines in the air—burning steel moving smoothly through blubber and bone and muscle, coming out the other end. Whale halves fell side by side, convulsing with shock, smoked to essence.\par
That felt so easy.\par
Damn.\par
One of the beasts had made it to shore and was skidding across the ice, mouth cranked open, looking to swallow him whole. He wheeled his Axe back around and fed it down that fleshy, ribbed tunnel of a throat. He didn't even load it with a Skill. Just shoved it in, poured pure Stormfire through. And it roasted the Whale from the inside as it went down its slip-and-slide throat. The sheer momentum of the throw, the weight of the Axe going through, blew out its sputtering speed. And a Monster the size of a school bus came to a skidding not ten feet from his face. He peeked inside.\par
Just a tunnel of flame down there. In seconds it was hollowed out. Then it was nothing. The Whale Sharks were gone, smoked out.\par
Zane turned back to that huge block of ice, to the Leviathan stuck within it. And the beast let out a mournful, furious cry, a cry that shook the world, jittered the waters and the ice. It sent reverberations down Zane's steely body—it made him see double.\par
Then the icy sea began to stir.\par
He saw the beginnings of it coming. A shelf of a wave in the distance, starting right about where the Leviathan was, building, picking up plates of ice. Picking up speed and tons upon tons of water until it was a thirty-foot-tall behemoth surging straight for him.\par
One Rising Storm Slash tore it in half.\par
The icy water went sloshing to either side of him. He thought some might splash him for a second—then the Stormfire got hold of it. It was steam before it could graze him. That whole wave: just a wall of steam rising to the ceiling.\par
Zane grinned.\par
Stormfire was awesome.\par
He saw another shelf of water forming. The beasts seemed to be content to just shoot at him from its icy castle.\par
So Zane took the fight to it.\par
He loosed a Rising Storm Slash. It crossed the lake in a blink and sank deep into that great ice block, sizzling as it did. And the ice began to burn.\par
It was one small wound on one huge block. Luckily, Zane had essence to spare. He slashed, slashed, slashed again, loosed a blizzard of slashes, blanketing the face of the glacier with angry red scars. Soon he was lopping off huge chunks of it, sending barn-sized slabs sloshing into the lake.\par
Carving his way straight to that cruise ship of a beast.\par
The Leviathan bellowed that earth-shattering bellow again. Zane didn't need his Sage Mind empathy to tell him the thing was furious.\par
Then the glacier shattered. All at once.\par
The sound was ear-popping. The splash washed the walls, brushed icicles off the ceiling. And the Leviathan Glacier Whale splashed into the lake, and charged him.\par
Oh boy.\par
It opened its mouth, so huge and strange it could've been a portal to another world. And a freezing whirlpool spun up, sucking in water currents and air streams and whole icebergs, sucking everything down that black hole of a gullet, stripping chunks of ice off the very land Zane stood on and shunting it down its throat.\par
Zane stomped. He got his feet a good way into the ice, sticking his footing. Then he just kept slashing, and slashing, and slashing—\par
He was hurting it. He could tell. His fires were taking to its essence, to the flesh on the roof of its huge mouth. Still they were only little glowing pockets dotting that vast landscape of flesh…\par
Its vitality—just the sheer bulk of it—was too much. It was five, maybe ten seconds away and rushing in fast. And the winds tore at him like hurricane winds; they felt like giant cold arms grabbing at his body, dragging at him hard. He blinked his streaming eyes. He couldn't see himself standing much longer. The moment he lost his footing, he was going in.The tale has been illicitly lifted; should you spot it on Amazon, report the violation.\par
Looked like he'd be going on a very unpleasant scuba dive. He figured he could carve it up from the inside…\par
Or.\par
He chucked an Axe straight at the ceiling, sank it several inches deep into the ice. He started loading his other Axe with essence, with Stormfire. As much as he could in the little time he had left.\par
Then he yanked hard. So hard his Axe came shooting right back out, but it didn't matter. He went shooting up too. Up out of the path of that icy vortex, up some fifty or sixty feet in the air, until he and the Glacier Whale saw eye to eye.\par
Then he loosed his loaded Axe.\par
Rising Storm Slash!\par
He wasn't ready for how that much Stormfire would look. It took his breath away. It was a light that eclipsed every other light. The contrast made it seem the sole brightness in a vast dark sea.\par
The power—the majesty of it—as he floated there, suspended in the moment, he felt like an astronaut on the edge of space, watching sunrise come over the curve of the Earth. Just this otherworldly bright, glorious red-white arc, dropping like an anchor. Straight into the glacier whale's eyeball.\par
Something squishy burst. And what was once black surrounded by white squirted out—until its whole eye went black. The Axe kept going—he felt it carve through flesh and fat, burst through bone, the shell of the skull. It met the squishiness inside.\par
Then it just kept going. And going. And going. Until it hit rock bottom.\par
The Glacier Whale crashed bellowing into the cavern wall. Zane was just lucky he was still midair. That impact looked pretty nasty. Cracks burst up and down the whole chamber. Skyscraper-sized icicles rained from the ceiling. For a second he was worried it'd all come crumbling down.\par
But it seemed to hold as he touched down.\par
The Whale was still alive, somehow still thrashing. It made some kind of sense—with that thing's size, it would be like sticking a needle through someone's brain. They could still live.\par
But what Zane was counting on came next.\par
The eye his Axe went through wasn't an eye anymore. It was a hollowed-out black crater, burnt to a crisp.\par
And somewhere deep in that skull, the Monster's whole brain was set on fire. He couldn't see it, but he could hear it. The roaring and the crackling flooded out.\par
The Whale gave one last shudder, flopped its tail, and lay still.\par
Then its pale gray-white skin turned whiter and whiter still, until it was pure light. Until the whole beast was one explosion of essence-light.\par
So much essence came flooding into Zane, and at once, he went blind for a full ten seconds. All he could see was white. Then—\par
Level Up! Essence Level 87 -> 88.\par
The Leviathan Glacier Whale has been defeated!\par
After all the steam flooded away, after all the waters settled, all that remained was a single bone-shard the size of a man’s body, like a piece of pure white driftwood.\par
Glacier Leviathan Bone (C)\par
The marrow of the Glacier Leviathan soothes and nourishes the mind, amplifying the wielder’s connections to Law. Contains the equivalent of a bushel of C-Grade Law Fruit. \par
Zane put it in his Bag of Holding.\par
***\par
He came out of it in the tunnels, feeling pretty pleased with how it'd all gone down. This might've been the first time he walked through a boss without getting a single health warning.\par
He wondered how strong he was in world terms. Not just his ranking—his raw powers. He had to be getting up there, right? Probably at least top 20.\par
Well. That left just one boss, then. Jotun, Lesser Ice Giant. That Vanessa girl still hadn't cleared it, apparently.\par
His head felt a little better now. He was ready to use Sage Mind again. It didn't take a lot. Full-on comprehension, though… still no. It'd be a while before he was ready for that.\par
He came to the fork in the tunnels. He was back at the start of the second floor.\par
He glanced at his mini-map. That was a lot of tunnels, to be fair… you could get really lost in this place. Some of them seemed to go in circles.\par
Zane just picked one at random and went for it.\par
These tunnels went round and round, ribbed with uneven sheets of ice. It felt like he was walking down the intestines of some translucent snake. The light that washed down through the ice was a warm orange. It seemed to be early afternoon outside. He saw gobs of new ice studding the walls, wrapping around the ceiling. So Vanessa had been here before. No wonder everything was so cleared out.\par
It took a few hours before he saw his first red dots. He was pretty excited as they came rushing up to him. Finally, some action!\par
Then they came upon him, and he almost caught his mini-map and made a mistake. Where were these…\par
He frowned at the tunnel ceiling.\par
Frost Seraph (Monster)\par
Essence Level 78\par
They were these little ice figurines with wings. They were the size of his hand. They flitted about like flies. They wore evil little grins. He frowned. A Rising Storm Slash almost seemed like overkill—and they were so small… how was he supposed to—\par
His vision blurred white and he blinked, grunting, wiping at his face. What the hell? They were cackling, laughing these tinkling little laughs as they zipped around his head. Even if he didn't have his Steel Body, that wouldn't have hurt. It was just annoying. Like getting water sprayed in your eyes. He slashed at them, and they flitted out of the way like flies from a swatter.\par
How were these even real Monsters? He didn't understand. He got out his Axes. He didn't get ticked off this quickly, this easily, usually. But something about these things just got him rankled. He was more than willing to go full Cyclone on these little shits.\par
The moment they saw steel, they shrieked and bolted. They were gone.\par
Zane figured out why they pissed him off. They reminded him of something.\par
… as far as Zane was concerned, those things were honorary birds.\par
Grunting in annoyance, Zane trudged along.\par
He was apprehensive at the next dot he saw drawing close, until he caught a glimpse of it through the ice. A blur too big to be a fake-bird. And it wasn't. It turned out to be a pile of jagged ice blocks welded together, nearly ten feet tall, with solid blue gemstone eyes.\par
Glacial Golem (Monster)\par
Essence Level 81\par
And behind it, cackling up a storm, were those freaking birds.\par
The Golem let out a shriek of a roar, then pounced. Its hammerlike arms smoked cold essence.\par
Zane split its head open with a frankly lazy Rising Storm Slash. Another lopped it clean off. And it toppled to a sad halt, smoldering at the stump.\par
Until essence started pouring out the birds in thick streams, hardening at the stump, sealing off the wound. In just seconds, you could see the nub of a head. Zane stared at it, frowning, then up at the birds. He ripped a Rising Storm Slash at the darn things. But the thing about being so small was they didn't need to move much to get out of the way.\par
The Golem had recovered enough to stagger up to a leg. Zane had enough. His Axe seethed Stormfire. Snarling, he raised it high and sent it crashing down in one harsh line.\par
It split the Monster in two. One ruler-line down its body. And both halves instantly caught fire; they spasmed as they melted.\par
Zane glared at the birds. Heal that. Stupid birds.\par
They flew away screaming.\par
That's what I thought.\par
God, he hated birds. And they weren't even birds.\par
***\par
A few hours of aimless wandering later, and he'd made scant progress. He'd smashed a couple more golems. Got spat on by a few more birds. He was thinking about calling it a day until he saw a white dot with an 'S' on it pop up ahead.\par
Oh. That Vanessa girl. He was pretty lost down here. Maybe she'd have a clue?\par
***\par
Vanessa Volkova was lost. Completely lost. She'd been here over a day. It felt like she'd gone backwards, if anything.\par
She was getting frustrated trudging down these ridiculous tunnels over and over. And the more frustrated she felt, the more her mind drifted.\par
She couldn't seem to stop replaying it—the absolute most humiliating moment of her life...\par


\section{81. Princesses \u0026 Queens (I)}
\par
That man.\par
How dare he?!\par
The moment he grabbed her, she should've kicked him between the legs! What had come over her? Just… the way he growled at her, deep and raspy, the way he looked at her… it was like all her thoughts went out the window.\par
"Arrgh!" She took her anger out on a flock of passing Frost Seraphs. Blasted them to dust with a flick of her staff.\par
The worst part was, she owed him now. He must be feeling proud of himself, swooping in like that. She reckoned he was used to girls swooning in those muscley arms of his. The thought made her want to puke.\par
She buried her face in her hands and groaned.\par
"I can't believe I'm losing my mind over some—some run-of-the-mill himbo," she mumbled. "Get yourself together, Nessa."\par
She tried to keep things in perspective. She was Vanessa Volkova, World Rank 28, heiress to the House of Volkova, one of the most storied noble families in Europe—she had queens of England and Russia in her line. And now she was the princess of the North Star Faction. Perhaps the most powerful Faction in the world, what with her mother's World Ranking. She had some of the most eligible men in the world on their knees for her—Top-20 World Rankers, even—and she didn't spare them a second glance!\par
Meanwhile, who was he? A nobody! Everything about him screamed simpleton. Six months prior he was probably a farm boy or something equally ridiculous. He wouldn't have been fit to be her servant.\par
That did make her feel better.\par
She let out a tight breath.\par
…Who was he anyway?\par
How do you really kill that Marquis? He didn't seem like he was boasting. And he seemed strong too…\par
She looked up at her mini-map. And saw the dot not ten feet from her. And she felt a stab of pure horror.\par
She turned slowly around, praying to God it wasn't who she thought it was.\par
There he stood at the mouth of the tunnel, blinking at her.\par
She cried out, reddening further. Had he heard all that?\par
"I wasn't—I wasn't talking about you!" She spluttered. "Who'd fancy you, you ugly brute?!"\par
"… what?" Rumbled the man, blinking. "I was just wondering if you knew where the boss was."\par
God. He looked so stupid! Just look at him blinking and scratching his head like a moron. Sure—so maybe he was a little handsome. But he was thick as a brick! What could she possibly have been thinking?\par
"If I'd seen the boss, I wouldn't be wandering around here like a headless chicken, would I?" She scoffed. "Idiot. And didn't I tell you not to follow me?"\par
An awkward look crossed his face. "But… there's only one boss left…"\par
"Tch!"\par
Just then a swarm of red dots flitted out from the tunnel ahead. More Frost Seraphs. Snarling she swept out her staff, and a Blizzard Gale crushed them into the cavern walls with incredible force. One tried to get out of it, shrieking and flailing but she sucked it back in and ground it to little glittering shards.\par
The big oaf just stared at her, his mouth a little open. That's right, she thought proudly.\par
"You do know, by the way," she said crossing her arms. "If he didn't wait for me to tire out, I would've beaten him myself. I didn't need your help!"\par
"… What?"\par
"My fight! Against the Marquis!"\par
"Oh." The big guy scratched his head again. "I believe you."\par
"Hmph."\par
Then they were just staring each other. She wasn't sure what to say. She panicked.\par
"I'm going left," she said, gesturing at the tunnel's head trying to sound self-assured. Like she was the one in charge here. That's right—she was taking charge. "You go right! If I catch you stalking me…"\par
She gestured at the wall, where she'd smashed the Frost Seraphs. "Am. I. Understood?"Stolen from its rightful place, this narrative is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\par
She stared him down, feeling powerful.\par
And she was pleased to see he was the one who folded.\par
"Alright," he said, raising his hands, looking a little exasperated.\par
She marched off through the tunnel she chose, feeling proud of herself.\par
***\par
…What?\par
Zane blinked.\par
Well. He supposed he was going right.\par
He found a few Golems trudging about. This time he started loading his Axes before they even came up, so he could one-shot the darn things, giving their little bird groupies nothing to work with.\par
That mean girl's powers would have come in useful. But man. She really hated him. He went. And he wasn't even sure what he'd done wrong.\par
Anyway.\par
He kept on going. Eventually the thin line of the tunnel on his mini-map opened up. There was a room up ahead—A room glittering with yellow dots. A new treasure area?\par
A door greeted him up ahead, this heavy, thick slab of dense ice, and on it was one of those giant steering wheel thingies you saw on bank vaults.\par
Vault of the Frost King (C+)\par
Jotunn, Lesser Ice Giant, stores the fruits of his conquest in his Imperial Vault. To enter, you must solve the Thousand-Year Riddle on the door. Hint: What is only found in winter?\par
There were a bunch of ice runes carved on there, glowing pale blue, and underneath there were a few lines of text. It translated neatly as Zane read:\par
I live when all else dies and die when all else lives. You may find me in the depths of the fiercest Blizzard yet never in climes where—\par
Okay, this wasn't happening.\par
Zane got out his Axes and gave it a slash. It did less than he'd hoped. But it did leave a mark. So you could damage these things.\par
In Zane's experience, anything you could solve with your brain was better solved by brute strength.\par
So he did. He just stood there and loaded his Axes with so much storm fire they were melting little craters into the ice they sat on. Then he slashed a brilliant cross on the vault door.\par
There was a blinding explosion.\par
And it was smoking and melting a little, and pretty darn scarred. But still standing.\par
… This thing was really tough.\par
Oh well. He could just do it again, couldn't he?\par
So he did. Again and again until it cracked the thing open all the way. Then he gave it a hearty kick, and the slabs gave out.\par
He was admitted into a glittering chamber. Mounds of glistening gemstones, red and green and blue, lay everywhere. And nestled atop them as though they were plush cushions—huge golden totems. Giant horned crowns. Random statues—like one of a gargoyle with sapphires for eyes.\par
Then there were the pillars of ice scattered throughout the room. Thick chests were frozen in the middle of them.\par
He freed one with Stormfire and looked inside. He found a wealth of mid-grade essence stones. Another had clumps of 'essence sapphire.' A third had diamonds as big as his head. Just lots of rich-looking stuff. Reina could probably make good use of this stuff. He imagined it would trade for a lot with the Essence Beacon.\par
He got farther into the Vault and started seeing human stuff. Dented breastplates, broken gauntlets scattered around, crooked smashed helms. Also, Bags of Holding filled with all kinds of adventurer's goodies. Mostly healing vials, essence vials. Some changes of armor. One D-grade Escape Portal. It was lucky you could store Bags of Holding in Bags of Holding. He'd need a lot of them to haul all this stuff home.\par
At the very end of the Vault lay the thickest ice pillar of all. Just one thing was frozen inside. A Bag of Holding like none he'd ever seen. It was woven through with gold thread—not fake gold either. He wasn't sure how he could tell, but it just looked expensive.\par
He burned it out of the ice and grabbed hold of it. Sure enough—\par
Bag of Holding (B)\par
Stores a pocket dimension within, allowing its owner to carry an inventory of objects without the burden of their space or weight. At B-grade, this treasure can store approximately 1 mile by 1 mile by 1 mile of space.\par
It was the highest-grade Bag of Holding he'd ever seen. He almost couldn't imagine what you'd even do with that much space. When you looked inside, there was barely anything in it. A ton of vials of healing. Some… smoked fish? And colorful candies? A few mirrors—a pocket mirror, one full length. And perfume. Several sets of clothes, all fancy robes, the sort you'd wear to a dance.\par
… what? The other stuff, the armor, made sense. Who brought this stuff to a dungeon raid?\par
Then there was a silk-bound manual with pages soft to the touch, infused with a faint sweet fragrance. The cover had intricate gold embossings… he swore they were of two bodies intertwined.\par
Mephisto's Pleasure Sutra (B)\par
A Dual Cultivation Sutra made by the Demon Mephisto for his lover during their honeymoon. By harnessing the powers of pleasure, this Skill grants great essence to couples through the act of love-making. The more intense the sensations, the greater the essence—\par
Okay, that was quite enough. Zane didn't blush easily. But just flipping through the pages, he saw a lot of illustrations. He couldn't help but think of Reina. It got him all flustered.\par
He pocketed the thing, still red-faced. ...Just for safekeeping, of course.\par
He scooped up everything in the Vault and kept on going—but he soon found that was pretty much it for this fork. He'd hit a dead end.\par
Well. Time to backtrack. He guessed Vanessa had chosen the right way after all. She'd threatened to beat him up if he went that way. But he thought about it.\par
Why did she have dibs on the dungeon boss anyway? She just walked around like she owned the place. And she'd been nothing but rude to him, which didn't bother him particularly much, but it didn't endear her to him either.\par
He couldn't really find a good reason to listen to her.\par
Well. Too bad. He was going the other way too.\par
***\par
About an hour later… \par
\par
She found it!\par
Yes!\par
There it was—a frozen arch looming before her. And beyond… a chamber with a huge red dot in it.\par
She'd found the Boss, and that foolish oaf was probably still bumbling around in the cold. She couldn't wait to clear it. Then rub it in his stupid face.\par
She stepped up to the arch.\par
Warning!\par
You are about to enter the lair of the Final Boss. The Final Boss of a C-Plus-ranked Dungeon is equivalent to a Boss of a B-ranked Dungeon.\par
She paused. For just a moment. Then she remembered him 'saving' her like she was some hapless damsel, and flushed with the humiliation of it. For the hundredth time that day.\par
Screw this—she’d fought B-ranked bosses before, hadn’t she?\par
She was Vanessa Volkova! She didn't need any help. If anything, that Boss was in trouble!\par
She marched straight in, head held high.\par


\section{82. Princesses \u0026 Queens (II) }
\par
Vanessa strode into the Boss Lair with her head held high.\par
It was a throne room made entirely of ice. The ceiling arched so high it seemed like a second sky. Little crystals studded the dome, twinkling like stars in the deep dark blue. It sloped down in icy pillars, pillars dense with Law. Frost smoke drifted off of them, making little wispy clouds that hung low in the chilling air.\par
She was begrudgingly impressed.\par
Well of course it'd be big, she told herself. It's a hall built for giants! Nowhere near as pretty as her mother's castle, though.\par
At the far end of it, motionless on a stark ice throne, sat the Boss. Jotunn.\par
It looked much like its golem minions, just bigger. A lot of thick, rugged ice welded together. The joints glowed an eerie blue. Icicles streaked off its face, making a white beard. Its eyes were bright blue and coldly empty.\par
As it saw her striding up, he stood. Smooth and easy. No joints creaking. No scraping. It didn't grunt or groan—just stood silently and stared at her. It was somewhat unnerving.\par
Thick frost smoke poured off its body.\par
Jotunn (Monster — Lesser Ice Giant)\par
Essence Level 95\par
That gave her a little pause. Then she shook her head. How many Level 90-plusses had she taken down before?\par
Though… usually, that was with her Mother’s help…\par
No. It was like Mother always said—if you let doubt cloud your mind, you’ve already lost. She had this. She was Vanessa Volkova, crown princess of the most powerful Faction in the World! She could take a Boss in some piddling backwater dungeon.\par
She turned up her lip at it, feeling powerful.\par
Bring it on!\par
Just then, a cloud of glittering dust poured out from behind Jotunn. Frost Seraphs. Judging by how dense they were on her mini-map, there must've been hundreds.\par
She frowned at them, wondering just how she'd go about wrecking the little beasts when Jotunn clenched his fist.\par
Streams of frost smoke started pouring out. Some kind of Skill. Then he took a step—a step that groaned cavernously down the hall, a step so heavy it sent cracks spidering down the icy floor.\par
Then another. Then another, eyes brightening. And it charged her.\par
She could've laughed. Stupid beast. Blizzard Artisan!\par
Icicles crackled into being to either side of her, building fast, loaded with a trifecta of Major Ice Laws: Crystal Formation. Deep Freeze. Winter's Dominion.\par
Jotunn kept charging, oblivious. It made her job a whole lot easier. Snorting, she threw out an icicle. It flew like a missile—right for the thing's throat. It couldn't even block in time.\par
It could only watch as that devilishly sharp point made impact. And exploded.\par
The blast took off half its face.\par
She pursed her lips. “…What?”\par
It wasn’t bad. But she’d expected to take the thing’s head off. How is it still…?\par
Then she felt a stab of horror.\par
It was healing. Ice packed on its face so fast she couldn’t believe it—in a beat it was blinking again. It was all those Seraphs it had behind it! She frowned. She had to get rid of them first.\par
But there was no time. It was rushing her, fists swinging—\par
Gritting her teeth, she threw a second icicle—this one right at its eyes. Blew off the top of its head.\par
But that didn’t stop its momentum.\par
It just kept charging. It was just three of those massive strides away now, and she was starting to panic. She thrust out her staff. Chilling Embrace!\par
A blizzard roared to life behind the Giant. Furious winds dragged at it, trying to yank it backward. A chunk of that Frost Seraph cloud got dragged in and shredded in those fierce winds…\par
Jotunn stuttered. But that was all.\par
It wasn’t dashing anymore. But it kept surging, planting foot after foot, step after step, getting closer even as hurricane-like winds ripped at its body—it didn’t make sense! She could tear off whole buildings with those winds! Something about that frost smoke—it had the same Laws her winds did. It cancelled her out!\par
The Boss loomed over her now. All she felt was horror, like a shock of ice water to the face. She cried out—and with the last of her strength, she threw up an icy shield.\par
That massive fist fell. There was a cold blast. Her shield cracked—then it pounded it again, and shattered. It was like watching a hammer go through a window pane. The force of it crushed her into the pillar. She barely had time to throw up another shield before a fist came down again and broke it utterly. Blood spurted out from her mouth. She didn't know what to do! She kept throwing up shields—she could barely hold it off—she wasn't sure how long she could last. She—\par
Then it shattered a shield. But before she could get another up, another fist came through. And crashed into her chest.\par
The force was like nothing she'd ever felt. The pain was like nothing she had ever felt. She went hurtling like a cannonball, cracked hard into a pillar, and slid bonelessly to the ground, shaking, blood dribbling from her lips. She just lay there in a daze, gasping.\par
She blinked involuntary tears out of her eyes. Everything hurt so much....\par
Warning!\par
Health under 25\%\par
She stared dumbly at it.\par
Seventy-five—in one blow?!The narrative has been illicitly obtained; should you discover it on Amazon, report the violation.\par
Then, at the silent, cold, unfeeling beast charging her again. She trie, but she couldn’t seem to move—it just hurt too much.\par
She didn't understand. A fist came down with the force of a glacier, huge and overwhelming, and brutalized her paper-thin shield. How could you even resist that? It was too much…\par
She realized, with a dull shock, that she was going to die.\par
God…\par
As she lay there, watching it come closer through hazy eyes, she felt like the stupidest person in the world.\par
All Vanessa could think about then was how disappointed Mother would be if she saw her like this. ‘You pathetic hotheaded fool. How many times have I told you your pride would be the end of you? It’s almost poetic.’ Her eyes brimmed with tears. She was right, of course. Mother always was. Vanessa wondered, in a kind of surreal haze, watching that Monster stomp closer an closer, why it always took a beating to drill something into her. It’d sure be nice if she could learn the first time, wouldn’t it?\par
She didn't know what to do. Her head throbbed something awful.\par
The fist came down…\par
There was an immense crash. Her world shook.\par
There was a silence. A silence filled only by the sound of her breathing. And the sound of someone else's, too, right in front of her—heavy and slow.\par
Her eyes fluttered open.\par
She didn't know what she'd expected to see. But not this—a wall of tensed, rippling muscle right in front of her. She realized it was a very broad back.\par
A very broad back of a very broad man. He'd stopped that massive blow cold.\par
What?!\par
The man grunted, shifted his force in one huge move. It was a flash of red and white—and the Giant went flying. Flying! It crashed into a pillar. Almost like she had just a moment before. Her Blizzard couldn't even move it!\par
A deep, smoking gash ran down its chest.\par
… just… just what was this power?\par
The man turned back to her. His forearms were bruised purple, but the rest of him looked fine.\par
Her mouth felt dry. It was him!\par
The man cursed. "Birds."\par
"… What?" she croaked.\par
He gestured at the huge swarm behind Jotunn, pouring in rivers upon rivers of pale essence. In a heartbeat, the Giant had healed up so much you could hardly see the wound.\par
"Kill the birds," he rumbled. "I'll take care of the Giant. Got it?"\par
She nodded quickly. "Yes," she breathed.\par
And he strode back into the fray.\par
***\par
Zane saw the problem with his Boss the moment he laid eyes on it.\par
Jotunn (Monster — Lesser Ice Giant)\par
Essence Level 95\par
Laws:\par
Major Law of Deep Freeze\par
Major Law of Winter's Dominion\par
Major Law of Glacial Might\par
Key Skills:\par
Glacial Fortitude (Passive) [Epic]\par
Grants extraordinary resistance to physical damage of all kinds—slicing and concussive. The wielder's icy body gains a glacier's implacable fortitude.\par
Cold Shield (Passive) [Epic]\par
The Lesser Ice Giant is enveloped in a protective aura of freezing energy, severely blunting all incoming magical damage and freezing it in place.\par
Permafrost Heart (Passive) [Epic]\par
Grants an immense regeneration capacity, augmenting the wielder's natural regeneration. This effect is significantly strengthened in cold environments.\par
Avalanche Smash (Active) [Uncommon]\par
Brings the force of an avalanche down upon the opponent, overwhelming all magical shields and dealing immense concussive damage.\par
Snow Crash (Active) [Epic]\par
A last-resort Skill. The wielder triggers a self-destruct, converting all of its energies and life force into a massive instantaneous explosion.\par
Three Epic-ranked defensive Skills. All passive. One regeneration, two pure defense. It was nuts. Plus it had all those birds healing it…\par
Zane nailed it with another Rising Storm Slash as it got to its feet. He managed a pretty deep cut. But it smashed at him again. By the time he got out of the way and spun back around, he saw it'd mostly healed. Freaking birds.\par
The Giant threw at Zane, and Zane threw right back. His Axe ripped down its front, blazed fresh trails down its mountain of a body. And it clocked him with a few good ones with that weird smash Skill—the fists just clang'd off his body. The ice never went very deep. It still stung like hell, though. He didn't mind letting it hit him a few times if it meant he could give more back. Only it was still healing too fast—he couldn't do this forever. What was taking her so—\par
Ah. There it was. He could feel a blizzard coming, picking up speed and power in the center of the hall. He reached back with these feelings, felt her intent. Where she meant for it to go. He had it.\par
He swung with the Giant again, traded a few hard shots. Then he leaped back, leading it on as it stumbled after him. The birds came with it too.\par
Right into the path of the Blizzard.\par
The blizzard winds made a beautiful arc down the corridors, sucking in the birds, scooping up the whole cloud of them at a single go, shredding them up. In seconds they went from a cloud of shrieking beasts to a cloud of glittering dust. This sparked joy in Zane.\par
Now the real fight began.\par
He turned just in time to meet a fist driving at him up top. He was too slow to dodge. He caught it on his forearms and it felt like his bones might shatter. He came away with deep purple bruises. He winced. This thing hit harder than anything he'd ever fought.\par
Then its other fist whomped him in the belly.\par
It felt like getting struck by a battering ram. It punched the air straight out of him—he felt the force go up his guts.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%\par
But he grinned even as blood leaked from his lips. His body had taken all that momentum, all that force—but he'd held firm. He had it exactly where he wanted it.\par
A beat after it struck him, his Axe finished its giant arc and chopped deep into the joint of the arm.\par
It went in so clean, just the angle he'd imagined it—it almost lopped the limb off then and there.\par
The Giant stumbled back, suddenly off balance. And his other Axe rushed from the front and finished the job. A giant craggy arm crashed to the ground.\par
Now he'd gotten it angry.\par
It rushed after him, face twisted, mouth wide open in a soundless roar. It tried grabbing hold of him, but he Volt-stepped out of the way like a matador and whipped it on the back with his Chains. With how unwieldy it was now, it didn't take a lot to send it crashing off balance.\par
Before it could get back up, he sank an Axe into its chest. He shoved it to the ground again. Then he leaped on top of it, clenched fists blazing with Stormfire, and just started wailing at its head.\par
THUD. THUD. THUD. He smashed it again and again. Soon it was burning up and melting at the same time. It shuddered, trying to stand, but Zane had his weight on it now, all the weight of his Chains on it now. It just couldn't get up. It couldn't do anything but take the beating. Zane grinned bloodily.\par
Then he felt desperation light up its twisted soul. And its whole body began to glow…\par
Shit. He knew exactly what it was going to do.\par
Snow Crash.\par
He went straight for Vanessa. She yelped as he scooped her up and buried her in his body.\par
The self-destruct blast hit.\par
Pain tore up his back, digging deep into the muscle. It felt like all his skin had been flayed off at once—then cold knives carved into the tender flesh underneath.\par
He hissed.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 50\%\par
Savage Body activated!\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Then there was only silence.\par
Jotunn Lesser Ice Giant has been defeated!\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 88 -> 89\par
C+-ranked dungeon Abyssal Crater has been cleared!\par
He pulled back, breathing heavy, still hot from the fight. And there was Vanessa, limp in his arms, flushed, breathing just as heavy as he was.\par
"Wow," she whispered.\par
"Are you alright?" He said, and she nodded.\par
Her gaze started to soften. "What's your name?" She said it weirdly shyly.\par
He thought about not telling her. But at this point… "Zane Walker."\par
"Zane Walker," she breathed, and he got a bad feeling from the way she said it.\par
Zane got some warning before it happened. He'd reached out to her during the fight, and they were still connected. He thought she'd be scared—but all she felt were weird feelings. Again. But much more intense than before.\par
Contrary to apparently popular belief, Zane was not a brick. He was a man, literally hot-blooded in this moment, holding a beautiful girl with the kind of slim yet curvy body that’d make other girls deeply jealous. And she was very close just then; her feelings for him just poured into him…\par
He blinked.\par
But… he’d only felt these things for Reina. Looking at her, feeling these things—it just felt wrong.\par
She leaned in, closing her eyes, red lips drawing together—\par
Uh oh.\par
He panicked and dropped her.\par
She landed on her ass in freezing water.\par
She stared up at him, mouth slightly open. He stood, scratching his head sheepishly.\par
“Uh,” he said. “I have a girlfriend.”\par


\section{83. Miss Maker (I) }
\par
She sat there, mouth slightly open, in silence.\par
It was getting awkward. She looked so stunned he wasn't sure she was still in there.\par
Then she started to tremble. He r face was reddening fast.\par
"Did—did you think I was trying to kiss you?!" She spluttered. She choked out a laugh. "Idiot. You wish!"\par
She was very red as she crossed her arms. "Hmph!"\par
"…Sure?"\par
"Now, if you'll excuse me," she said haughtily. Then, head held high, she turned on her heel and strutted out of the room.\par
She went beyond the arch, made a turn, and vanished from sight.\par
She hardly took ten steps before she just collapsed. Zane could see her dot go still on the mini-map. He could also see her through the translucent walls. She seemed to be holding her head in her hands.\par
Then she slid slowly down the wall she was leaning on, buried her face in her dress, and screamed into it.\par
The dress muffled the sound a little. But less than she probably thought it did. He could hear it pretty clearly from where he stood now, which… he didn't think she meant to happen.\par
“…”\par
She was standing now. He couldn't really see what she was up to. Then he felt little flashes of pain radiating and frowned.\par
When he went to check up on her, he found her banging her head on the tunnel wall. "You idiot!" She cried. "You stupid dumb idiot! Stupid stupid stupid—" she punctuated each word with a bash of her head. With Sage Mind, he could sense the pure humiliation flowing off her.\par
"Uh," said Zane, wincing. "Are you alright?"\par
She froze. Then slowly turned to look up at him.\par
He got a very specific feeling from her, just as strong. It went beyond humiliation. She just wanted to dissolve into a puddle on the floor and evaporate.\par
He winced. He felt kind of bad for her, honestly. He wasn't sure what to say.\par
They just stared at each other. Then—\par
"You… saw all of that, didn't you," she said hoarsely.\par
He nodded.\par
"I see," she said. "Would you do me a favor?"\par
He sensed no deceit from her. Just that same shattered feeling. It felt like she really needed this, so he said, "What is it?"\par
"Turn around, close your eyes, and count to ten." Her voice cracked on the last word.\par
He did.\par
Then he heard the pitter-pattering of sudden footsteps. Fading fast into the distance. Had she just…? He finished counting and opened his eyes.\par
Sure enough. He saw her dot speeding up the mini-map. She'd made a break for it—she was gone.\par
Then he thought—wait.\par
Where was she going?\par
…She couldn't be headed to claim the Beacon or the dungeon chest, right? Somehow he doubted it. But he went after her just in case. Soon he saw her winding up the last of the steps—out onto the surface. Then—\par
No. She wasn't headed for the Beacon at all. She just kept running. And didn't stop. By the time he saw daylight she was most of the way up the crater rim.\par
She'd just run all the way out of the dungeon.\par
"… Bye?"\par
Well, that was weird.\par
Anyway.\par
***\par
\par
He went back down to the Boss Lair and found something lying on the empty throne. A gemstone the color of glacier ice, big as his fist and craggy all over.\par
Ice Essence Monster Core (B)\par
 The remains of the lesser ice giant, rich in ice aspect essence. Monster Cores are rare drops. They are highly prized for alchemy and often sell for great sums in Merchant Guild Auctions. Their essence can also be absorbed for direct cultivation.\par
Huh.\par
Alchemy? Zane didn't know you could do that. As far as he could tell the System only gave out combat classes. Maybe you could learn some other Skills on the side?\par
He scratched his chin. He vaguely remembered reading something about one of the higher-tier Beacon unlocks to do with access to some Merchant Guild. He'd have to ask Reina about it.The narrative has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\par
***\par
When he went out onto the ice to claim the Abyssal Crater's Beacon, he found a bunch of Factions huddled around already. None of them had broken the lock on the dungeon chest there. They were all just waiting for him. A big cheer went up when he arrived; he felt a huge cloud of relief pouring off them. There was lots of hugging and sobbing going around. Some of them even insisted on hugging him, which got a little awkward.\par
"You son of a bitch," said Clayton, the burly Faction leader he'd met earlier. He was grinning ear to ear as he clapped his hand on the back. "You actually went and did it!"\par
"I'm never going out of the Safe Zone again, swear to God," he heard someone moan, which seemed to be the mood for most of them.\par
A fair few of these folk came from the Southern Portland region. They pretty much unanimously wanted to Sub-Faction, so once he claimed the Beacon, he put them in touch with Reina.\par
Or rather—one of Reina's many assistants in charge of manning the Beacon and compiling all messages for her to review at her office at the start of each day. She'd gotten much too important to be manning it herself.\par
Around then, a bunch of 'Quest Completed!' notifications popped up, and the System granted him his rewards. He was 20 C-grade Essence Vials richer.\par
\par
***\par
The dungeon chest had less than he was used to. Just 6 Essence Stones. But what it lacked in quantity, it made up for in quality—they were all high-grade, set in soft velvet.\par
And they circled the central treasure.\par
A piece of paper.\par
A fancy piece of paper, to be sure, thick and yellow—not in an aged crumbly way; it was smooth and warm. Its neatly inked letters weren't translating in his head. On closer inspection, they seemed to be runes.\par
Seal of the Merchants Guild (B)\par
This seal may be used at B-ranked Beacons to access the Dragonspiral Galaxy's Merchant Guild, which governs all trade between the 9 Great Factions of the Dragonspiral Galaxy. Grants access to the Mortal-Grade section of the Guild's Year-End Auction.\par
This seal is valid for all Mortal-Grade items F through S.\par
Hmm.\par
Yeah, he'd give this to Reina and see what came out of it. The System had all the necessities, but its selection of Skill tomes and treasures was pretty lacking—those were almost always better gotten through dungeons, and there you couldn't really choose what you got there.\par
They didn't really have the spare money to upgrade to B-rank just yet. But once they did, it could be useful.\par
***\par
He binged all his new Essence Vials. It put him over the top.\par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 89 -> 90\par
Nice round number.\par
Before he went back, he spent an hour just going around the dungeon, trying to pick out some memento Reina might like. It was his goal now—every dungeon he visited, he'd get something for her. The Sutra was a kind of gift, he supposed, but it was a little… it wasn't really what he meant.\par
He ended up with something called a 'Frost Fractal Flower'—a C-grade essence treasure that looked like a very big snowflake. He chose it because it was very symmetrical and intricate. It seemed well designed, the kind of thing she would appreciate.\par
He did feel kind of bad leaving her so often. He wanted to take care of her.\par
If they upgraded the Beacon to B-rank, it'd give a lot of rewards, sure—but also teleportation from any Faction Safe Zone back to headquarters. That way, he could go about dungeon clearing in the day and be back for her a lot more nights if he wanted to…\par
It was an interesting thought.\par
Maybe with these new essence stones, they'd have enough to upgrade? He'd have to ask her when he got back.\par
***\par
He had a tendency to overshoot with Volt Blitz. He used it somewhat sparingly coming this way—he got lost pretty easily in the mountains. But going back, the route was much clearer. He just dashed for it. He was just a streak of lightning crossing the grassy plains, streaking through the forests, leaping easily across whole rivers. And in just about an hour, maybe less, he was back near Luminous Faction headquarters.\par
Not much has changed since he last visited. Which made sense, he supposed. Not much time had passed. He saw the floating watchtower first, tied down by that thick anchor; it reminded him a little of the house from Up. A giant telescope hung off the end of it—that was new. It swept over him, and he could feel the person inspecting him—he could feel their soul.\par
As he drew closer, the Emerald Forest came into view. There were a lot more yellow dots in it—set in rows, too. Like an orchard. Had Reina…?\par
"Sir!"\par
He blinked. He was coming up to the outer walls now. A host of warriors jogged up to him dressed in white, purple, and dark green—the Luminous Faction colors.\par
Jerry Eames\par
 Essence Level 38\par
He saluted. They all did; they had that stars-in-their-eyes look. "It's great to have you back, sir! We let the Mistress know as soon as our scouts saw you coming, sir!"\par
"Thanks…?"\par
Then he saw a dot coming up on his mini-map—a dot with an S on it.\par
A Signature? He wasn't aware they'd recruited any recently. Had Avery come back?\par
Then he saw Reina coming out from under the arched wooden gates and blinked.\par
"Zane!" She cried, rushing up to him. She leaped into his arms and kissed him fiercely. "Welcome back," she breathed. “I missed you.” She was all flushed and smiling at him. They were both gasping.\par
He was feeling a little lightheaded then—for a number of reasons. One of them stared him in the face.\par
Reina Torres\par
Essence Level 52\par
 Signature Title: Mistress Maker\par
"You're Signed now?"\par
"Oh!" A strange look came across Reina's face. "It's complicated."\par
She looked around, then took his hand and led him along. "Not here. I'll tell you inside."\par
\par
***\par
\par
They settled down inside Zane's cabin. Reina said she hadn't changed much—she'd just noise-proofed the walls. They settled down on a plain wool couch, side by side.\par
If Zane was honest, he'd always been a little surprised Reina didn't have a Signature Title. They are supposed to be given out to rare psychologies, right? Reina was one in a million, as far as Zane was concerned. Actually, that was underselling it. He was sure there was no one like her.\par
Now when he inspected her, he saw two new Skills:\par
\par
Resonance of Harmony (Passive) [Signature]\par
Enhances the efficacy of all Skills cast the Mistress's allies by 15\%.\par
Also passively enhances the Mistress's ability to perceive the harmonies of her surroundings. Grants her an instinctive awareness of the needs and strengths of her allies, letting her strategize with superhuman effectiveness.\par
\par
Architect of Restoration (Active) [Signature]\par
Repairs anything, animate or inanimate. Has the power to restore damaged structures, heal injuries, or even temporarily create objects or shelters from the ambient energy. Healing powers scale with Level. Current Power: Mortal C-Grade\par
\par
"This is great," he said. "It's perfect for you." And he meant it. He was excited for her.\par
He was wondering, though—"But… why now?"\par
As far as he knew, there wasn't really a time limit for when these things manifested. But most of the time, they seemed to come on pretty fast. She was over Level 50.\par
“That’s the complicated part,” said Reina. She hesitated. "Signature Titles are unique. They can only be held by one person at a time. And… the one who held mine just died."\par
Zane blinked. "How do you know?"\par
"They left me a message." She bit her lip. "Here—I'll write it out for you."\par

The message was choppy, going in bits and pieces. Reina thought it was written by someone delirious. Maybe on the brink of death or poisoned.\par
If you have received this Title, that means I, Jia Luyue, High Priestess of the Temple of the World Tree, am dead. My Title now passes to you. The Mistress Maker is the most sacred of the Temple's…\par
"The rest I couldn't make out," said Reina helplessly. "From there it goes into incoherent rambling," she continued. She then produced the only other sensible fragment:\par
It was the despicable Sage of White Ashes who ambushed me on Planet Thousand Gorges and murdered me in cold blood! You must inform the Evergreen Ancestor—he must already suspect the Azure Flame Faction. Avenge me!\par
"It ends there."\par
Zane wasn't sure what to make of it.\par
That… came out of nowhere.\par
"You're worried," said Zane. He could feel it.\par
"I don't know," muttered Reina. She sighed and shook her head. "I'm just... it's a lot. It probably won't amount to anything. I know. I just…"\par
Reina never even stuttered usually. It said something that she was at a loss for words.\par
Zane stroked her head. "You worry too much." It was true. He could almost see all the overthinking going on under her little frown.\par
"You're right. It's probably nothing. And if it's something, you have me," he said simply. "I'll be here for you. Always. I promise."\par
And he felt the blossom of warmth coming from her. He felt her relax a little. He wondered if using Sage Mind like this was cheating. Then again, he'd never been the best with feelings—his own or other people's. At least this way he could understand easier. It felt like making up for a lack, more than anything.\par
The message was pretty cryptic, and neither of them knew what to do with it. All this stuff about murdering and vengeance and priestesses... it was so distant it felt pretty much meaningless.\par
So Zane reassured her again and felt a little more tension go out of her. They set it aside.\par
He started asking her about other stuff to take her mind off it. He asked her about how the week had been going since she felt all knotted up with stress. As she went through her troubles—negotiating trade routes with Elias, dealing with the increasingly belligerent Harbormasters, tamping down on intra-faction territorial squabbling, he felt her starting to unwind. So he just kept nodding and asking her questions, trying to be genuinely curious—trying to be there for her.\par
At some point, she paused, pursed her lips. "I don't want to bore you."\par
"You never bore me," said Zane, and that was honest too. He could listen to her forever. She smiled, closed her eyes, made a happy little noise, and nuzzled deeper into his chest.\par
He started giving her a massage, gentle as he could, and she sighed. "How are you so good at this?" she murmured.\par
Of course, he was cheating—he could feel all her stresses. "Just relax," he said softly to her.\par
And slowly, she did. Slowly all her stress melted away until she was just a warm bubble of contentment. "You know," she said sleepily. "I've… never had this before."\par
He blinked at her.\par
"Just… this." She nodded to him.\par
"…Me?"\par
She gave him a little smile. "I mean—" And she started talking about how she grew up. Her father was never there, and her mother was a preschool teacher during the day and worked shifts as a line cook in a hotel kitchen during the night until her hip gave out. Then it was just Reina, having to work a second job all through middle and high school to take care of her mother—having to help raise her little cousins and put herself through college all the while. Her whole life she'd felt she had to live for the people counting on her. She'd never felt like she could breathe. Until now. Until she was with him. She said she felt a little guilty about it sometimes.\par
Zane frowned. He wasn't sure how to say this, so he said it the only way he knew how. He just said what he meant. "You're the most caring person I know," he said. "And…" he paused. He wasn't sure how to say this either—ah, fuck it. "I… love that. But sometimes… it can be too much. Maybe if you give too much of yourself away, there's nothing left." And he gave her a little kiss on the forehead. "Please don't do that. I really like you here."\par
It sounded pretty clunky once it came out of his mouth. There was a reason he didn't spend his time confessing his feelings usually. But he thought, eh. They were true. He wasn't about to be embarrassed about it.\par
"Zane…" sniffled Reina. He didn't need to reach out to her to know what she was feeling right about now.\par
Then she started kissing him.\par
****\par
After a bit, he could tell where this was headed. He thought now was a good time to bring out that Skill.\par
Mephisto's Pleasure Sutra (B)\par
A Dual Cultivation Sutra made by the Demon Mephisto for his lover during their honeymoon. By harnessing the powers of pleasure, this Skill grants great essence to couples through the act of love-making. The more intense the sensations, the greater the essence earnings.\par
Reina was pretty enthusiastic about trying it out. It was pretty easy getting started too. They got the theory down quickly, then started experimenting.\par
Long story short—his new empathy Skill was proving incredibly useful in far more ways than he'd expected.\par
This was definitely cheating; getting instant feedback was very helpful. And since the goal was to try to get it as intense as possible…If you stumble upon this tale on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
He was just thankful there was noise-proofing on the walls.\par
Reina gained 8 Levels that night.\par
***\par
She woke around noon, still pretty out of it. Zane saved some of that morning's breakfast for her and brought it for her in bed on a platter.\par
After she got some food in her, he got his first demonstration of her new powers. She waved her hand a couple of times and fixed up the broken bed... the cracked walls...the cracked ceiling... he winced. They'd gone a little overboard.\par
Afterward, they just sat there chatting pleasantly. They were keen to get at it again, but sadly Reina had a Faction to run. So it'd have to wait a few hours.\par
He knew he'd be getting itchy again soon. Soon he'd want to get out there. For today, though…\par
This was really nice.\par
***\par
Reina also gave him some 'dividends'—which were a bunch of treasures she'd bought with Guild money, set aside just for him. Since he was the most valuable member of the Guild, she said he should reap the best rewards too. Or so she said.\par
It was sound logic. But he sensed she just wanted to shower him with affection. She had this habit of trying to use logic to justify things like this, but Zane could tell.\par
In any case.\par
There were a few C-grade Law Fruit—for some reason, Fruits seemed to be the standard measure for Law treasures. He was too burned out to use those. But he did drink the many C-Grade Vials of Elixir.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 90 -> 91\par
***\par
Later that day, he got a message. It was from Avery, from some Safe Zone in Wyoming. She said she was having a blast. She was on her way back to the West Coast—she said she'd made all kinds of new friends along the way. She said they'd probably meet up soon, maybe near San Francisco. She also said she learned a bunch of new tricks and challenged him to a duel. "Get ready to get the shit beaten out of you! ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ”\par
That was actually how she closed her message.\par
How did she even get emojis into the… nevermind.\par
He was still a little too burned out to get back on Law stuff. He decided to take a few days off so his soul could recover. His next stop was the B-ranked dungeon, Titansteel Tree, in Northern California. It'd started to leak, wreaking havoc all around it—the local Factions had banded together to offer a pretty ridiculous sum of essence stones to anyone who could clear it. It would pretty much just be teams of World Rankers giving it a shot. And given the rewards, he suspected he'd be seeing quite a lot of them.\par
They didn't even need that to tempt Zane. Supposedly, B- and A- rank dungeons were a huge step up from C- and D- just like C- and D- were different levels from E- and F-.\par
He wanted to be fresh comprehension-wise whenever he got to treasure areas were in there. All the B-rank treasures he'd gotten so far had been huge for him. Now he was going somewhere stuffed to the brim with them.\par
He hadn't heard much about B-rank dungeons other than that they were extremely dangerous, even for World Rankers. They could only be taken on by World Ranker teams. And he knew they were structured differently too, with new mechanics, the same way C-ranks were totally different from E-ranks.\par
Some didn't even have 'Bosses' like he was used to. Just one 'Final Boss.' Instead, every single Monster there was like a normal dungeon Boss. Some were even stronger.\par
Zane was eager to find out.\par
***\par
He didn't spend his days strolling camp. He wouldn't call himself shy, but his ideal day was not having to talk to anyone. Except Reina. He'd had enough talking these past few days.\par
Still, though, he managed to pick up on a few things. He met Annie, the little girl he'd saved all those months ago—the very first person he'd met after the change. She was overjoyed to see him—she wanted to show him all her new moves. She was still a little girl and still feisty, but now she was also a Level 30 Barbarian mowing over grown adults. She was a little monster. When she said she wanted to be just like him, he hadn't thought she'd actually go through with it.\par
He saw a familiar face behind a little tea shop as he strolled back to the town square from the open-air tables where buffet breakfast was usually laid out. Behind the counter was Cale, beaming at him. Zane had honestly forgotten he existed for like a month there. They had a brief chat—Cale had totally stepped down from leadership, and now he was happy running his little shop because… that was possible now in the Luminous Faction. In the apocalypse. Weird to think about.\par
There wasn't a 'Coffee Shop Maker' class or anything; the System had no non-Combat Classes for some reason. But Cale had picked up a few brewing-related Skills. He said picking up non-combat Skills was much harder than combat Skills—the System didn't seem to like them.\par
Zane let himself take it easy for a few more days. He checked out some nearby Safe Zones. Watched the Rangers and the Priests drilling Skills in the lush open plains that had once been the Keeper's desolate Lair. He took a stroll through the Emerald Forest, now the 'Moon Fruit Orchard,' where anyone could walk up and pluck a juicy Moon Fruit off the bough, nurtured on supernaturally fertile soils, terraformed by the Beacon.\par
It was summer. Around noontime, you could see children running around the main square, splashing through the essence fountain. The sounds of their joy drifted over to him.\par
Sometimes he just looked out at all this. And just... soaked it in.\par
This was nice.\par
***\par
He ended up staying four days.\par
By the end of it, Reina was in the low Level 70s. He'd gotten two Levels out of it himself.\par
It was remarkable—he would never have thought the Skill would be so effective. He'd also never leveled a Skill so fast; he'd gotten the Pleasure Sutra up to Level 3 already.\par
To be fair, they did spend a significant portion of their days, and most of their nights, drilling. The Skill, that was. By the end of it, Reina's Architect of Restoration was at 'Mortal B+ Grade'—which he assumed just meant B+ Grade. It was the strongest healing Skill he'd ever seen.\par
***\par
By the end of it, his Stats—abbreviated to the most significant ones—looked like:\par
Zane Walker\par
Essence Level 93\par
Signature Title: Savage Sage\par
Laws:\par
Major Law of Scorched Wrath (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Major Law of Ethereal Flame (Elemental Law of Fire)\par
Major Law of Undying Might (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
Major Law of Pure Forging (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
Major Law of Discharge (Elemental Law of Electricity)\par
Major Law of Absolute Sharpness\par
Stats:\par
Vitality: 98.83\par
Regeneration: 49.9\par
Strength: 118.97\par
Dexterity: 63.0\par
Speed: 59.8\par
Key Skills:\par
Inferno Cyclone IV\par
Rising Storm Slash II\par
Fiery Renewal II\par
Man of Steel I\par
Volt Blitz I\par
Rising Storm Slash's Level seemed to have some carry-over from Rising Sun Slash.\par
He did wonder at his essence Leveling rate sometimes. It was pretty fast, but—even despite his rough starting place—he felt he Leveled slower than most. It was a feeling he'd gotten for a while now.\par
When he brought it up with Reina, she said her Leveling rate slowed too once she got she got her Signature Title, which let her do a Class Change to an Epic Class called 'Sylvan Priestess.' She said it was probably how essence was distributed. Since Epic classes gave more stats and essence went into stats, it took more essence to Level.\par
In Zane's case, he had both a huge essence pool and huge stat gains per Level, relatively. So for him it seemed to take even longer.\par
On the bright side, it meant nothing the same Level as him could touch him, pretty much. Even Monsters higher-Leveled than him had serious trouble nowadays.\par
***\par
Even with his 'slow' Leveling, he still found himself sitting at World Rank 19 when he checked the Beacon. Nice.\par
Then he checked higher up the list and frowned.\par
It seemed there'd been a shuffle-up these last few days.\par
1. Irina Volkova (S)\par
2. D'Angelo Hall (S)\par
3. Emeka Eze (S)\par
4. Jason Walker (S)\par
5. Jian Shi Ming (S)\par
6. Yui Urabe (S)\par
7. Cristina Dos Santos (S)\par
8. Mike Masters (S)\par
Jason was 4… Zane expected nothing less. But what surprised him was \#8. Mike Masters—the leader of the Tomb Kings—was now \#8.\par
And Dulce Ramos—the Cartel boss who'd previously been World Rank \#9—was gone.\par


\section{85. Setting Out}
\par
Reina got the updates. She heard it from Elias first, but within hours she'd verified the news.\par
The Tomb Kings had crushed the Cartel. They'd totally absorbed them and added another dozen World Rankers to their roster. By sheer firepower, they could be the strongest Faction in all of North America.\par
Reina paled a little when Zane told her about his run-in with the Marquis. He hadn't sensed any witnesses nearby, and something told him Vanessa wouldn't blab about it. Reina mulled it over.\par
"You're not the only one who's killed a Marquis," she told him. "They feud with a lot of Factions. Elias has killed a Marquis too. The Silicon Coven has been skirmishing with the Tomb Kings in Central California for weeks. There's high tensions there. They'll wipe him out before they come for us, and that's if they find out. They'll probably blame Vanessa."\par
On the Vanessa front, Zane decided not to mention the whole kiss thing. Reina was very reasonable most of the time, but she could get … territorial about him.\par
Even with all those caveats, Reina decided to take precautions. She'd double the guard on the Luminous Faction's southern border and sign a mutual defense pact with the Kootenai Rangers out east—just in case. They could provide ranged support in case a war broke out. She didn't like to take chances.\par
The Beacon also gave Zane an update on the world's dungeon clear percentage. It stood at 67\%—right under Integration Phase: 0. Put that way, it looked like a progress bar.\par
Zane wondered what would happen when it hit 100\%.\par
***\par
Quest: Clear the Titansteel Tree Dungeon!\par
Issued by: Consortium of NorCal Factions\par
The B-ranked dungeon Titansteel Tree has started to leak, and its Monsters have been menacing Northern California for weeks. If left uncleared, it will likely overrun the region—three to four Monsters a day leak out, and each is as strong as a C-ranked dungeon boss! This rate is only growing worse.\par
Your task is to slay the Final Boss of this dungeon and clear it once and for all.\par
Prerequisite: To participate, you must either be a World Ranker or be in a confirmed team with a World Ranker.\par
Reward: Forty high-grade essence stones and two B-grade Law Fruits. Rewards have already been submitted to and validated by the System. Ready for instant delivery upon Quest completion.\par
And underneath all that—\par
Participants: 58\par
Teams: 9\par
Zane assumed a good chunk of them were not World Rankers. But still—that was a lot in one place. To be a World Ranker, you had to be in the top 100 out of the hundreds of millions. Sometimes it was easy to forget it was a very small percentile in the grand scheme.\par
At least 9 World Rankers in one place? That was surprising. Even with the great rewards.\par
When he brought it up to Reina, she had a theory for it. As she seemed to have for pretty much everything. Elias had been inviting a lot of World Rankers over lately. Many probably just happened to be nearby.\par
He seemed to be making the Silicon Coven headquarters a kind of World Ranker honeypot. Reina said he had one of the only A-ranked Essence Beacons in the world, which let him buy all kinds of special treasure areas—and he wasn't afraid to spend.\par
He gave carte blanche invitations to all World Rankers to stay and use them. The only price was to have dinners with him and attend his parties so he had a chance to butter them up.\par
Zane wouldn't be surprised if he managed to hustle a few World Rankers. He had a way of squeezing deals out of people. Not everyone had a Reina to keep him straight.\par
…She really was the best.\par
Reina also said she knew for sure World Rank \#3, Emeka Eze, Signature Title' Touch of Death,' had been in San Francisco the past few weeks. Elias had bought a supposedly extremely expensive treasure area just for him. It was to help him break through the Level 99 bottleneck—you needed an Elemental Law, at least. He’d stay there until he got past it.\par
Reina said it was clear Elias was using his presence, plus that of a few other World Rankers, as a kind of buffer. Now that the Cartel was squashed and the Tomb Kings could turn their attention up north, Elias was getting nervous.\par
Still, though… things would come to a head sooner or later.\par
***This tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.\par
After Zane handed over all his recent earnings, they made an accounting of their treasury. Even with the new high-grade essence stones, it was a little too expensive to upgrade the Beacon to B-rank. With their resources now, once they did, they wouldn't even be able to afford any of the unlocks anyway. At least this was the logic Reina gave him when he proposed upgrading.\par
Then he said why he wanted to upgrade—so he could be with her most nights—she went ahead and did it that afternoon.\par
When she told him, she was blushing a little. She cleared her throat. "After some further consideration, I've decided it's the best move for the Faction going forward."\par
"Right."\par
"The teleportation function is critical. It's important to be able to move quickly in emergencies," she said defensively.\par
"…"\par
She was getting a little flustered under his cocked brow. "And also, I need you. For mental health, stress reasons, I mean. So I can perform well on a day-to-day basis. It's important for the Faction. And—and this way, we can also Level you, our best asset, with the…Skill. If you think about it, it's perfectly—"\par
He just kissed her.\par
***\par
Before he left, as they cuddled in bed together after a particularly intense session, she brought up the possibility of going with him. She could. She was a World Ranker now—World Rank 82. It would've been a lot higher just a few months ago. Folk were Leveling fast.\par
She set out a strong, airtight, three-pronged argument with the kind of self-assuredness you'd expect from a girl who'd once been student body president. But then again, Reina could probably take any position and make it sound convincing. It might've actually convinced him if Zane couldn't feel that underneath it all, she was a mess of affection right now. She just really wanted to be with him. Of course—more useful than all her new powers was her mind. Which she had to use to run their ever-growing Faction. Here.\par
A big benefit of her new powers, from Zane's perspective at least, was that he could rest easy leaving her here. She was already basically Joan of Arc when she led an army just with her strategizing. At least in Zane's eyes. Her new Signature Skill took that to a superhuman level—beyond her already superhuman level. And there was her world-class healing powers, which could mass heal a whole army. And the Skill boosts they'd get just from being near her…\par
She'd be fine.\par
***\par
Bright one morning, he set out on his journey. With the new B-ranked Essence Beacon, he could blip right over to the Abyssal Crater Dungeon. You could go from headquarters to any Faction Safe Zone, and vice versa, at the cost of a few mid-grade essence stones. The longer the teleportation, the greater the payload, the more the cost.\par
Soon he was back in the thick of the icy mountains, forging his way across the slopes. Out here the Cascades ran jagged. Most of the dungeons here weren't cleared. They were mostly D-rank or E-rank. A bunch of golems and ice spirits and frost giants, and banshees spewing icy winds, and frost serpents and Yeti-like things too. None of them could touch him. It just took a while to wade through.\par
For a while, all he could see on the horizon were more white peaks. The System seemed to have an affinity for crystals—they studded these dungeons like wild ferns.\par
Eventually he neared the end of the range, where he came to his first notable dungeon. Molten Mountain, a C-rank dungeon around where Mount Shasta had been.\par
It was a bunch of volcanic underground tunnels with rivers of lava and geothermal vents. Kind of like Mount Saint Helens, but with more lava, even—he spent most of his time frog-hopping between molten rock islands. After slaying a lion made out of molten rock and an ash wyvern, he made out with two treasures.\par
One was a Baby True Dragon's Claw. Another was an Obsidian Shard called 'Tear of the Volcano.' Both were C-grade Law treasures.\par
By now he'd recovered comprehension-wise. But he planned on saving himself for Titansteel. He suspected he'd find the best Law treasure areas there.\par
The one thing he did do was take a few hours, and upgrade Inferno Cyclone.\par
Skill evolution!\par
Inferno Cyclone [Rare] -> Stormfire Cyclone [Legendary]\par
It jumped two rarity tiers instantly.\par
He tried it out on a few passing Monsters, but they couldn’t even last one revolution. He’d need something really hefty to really test this thing, bring out its potential.\par
When he came over what felt like his fiftieth mountain, it was a surprise seeing a green, frost-caked valley snaked through with heavy mists.\par
It turned out to be a Safe Zone run by the aptly named Misty Vale Faction. As he descended, he found it full of charming little groves and freshwater streams. The folk here were mostly Priests, mystic-types, with a little self-sustaining community out here. After he made it clear he was just passing by, they were quite friendly. They confirmed he was on the right track.\par
They were quite happy he'd cleared the Molten Mountain. It was starting to leak, apparently. A lot of dungeons seemed to be leaking nowadays.\par
From there on, Zane went west. Titansteel was where the Redwood National Park used to be, near the coast. Soon he was wading through another mountain range. Less snowy. The air here was crisp and fresh; it was a pleasure to drag in lungfuls of it. He'd left civilization behind again. He trekked through the vast unknown under perfectly clear, bright blue skies. It just felt like adventure.\par
He knew he was getting close when the trees started popping up in force. If he thought Luminous Faction trees were huge, these things made him feel like an ant. Thick brown bark on a trunk like a giant's leg, going up, and up, and up…Their branches prickled with needle-like leaves.\par
Then he saw it.\par
He didn't know it was the dungeon—but what else could it be?\par
He thought 'Titanwood Tree' might be a metaphor. A singular Tree, as a dungeon? But no.\par
It looked like something straight out of a myth. A tree that could hold up the sky. It must've run hundreds of feet in diameter, maybe thousands—a trunk of warm brown streaked with gleaming silver, piercing through puffs of white cloud, stretching far out of sight. It was thickly grooved and ridged, making natural staircases spiraling up its sides. Giant holes like cavern mouths dotted it all over. It could've been an ancient tower if not for the branches.\par
They split out of the trunk in their multitudes, like the many, many arms of some Greek monster. Each was as wide as a highway. They held up vast canopies blanketing the sky in layers—canopies dappled bright greens here, bright silvers there. He could make out vague Monstrous shapes crawling around on them.\par
He got closer, summited a hill, and made out the base of the Tree. A mazelike tangle of roots sprawled out, burrowing deep into the earth for nearly a square mile in all directions. Light gleamed off of what seemed to be giant steel-shelled beetles milling about the roots.\par
But those weren't what interested him.\par
A circle of suits ringed the bottom of the Tree, sealing it off in a wide loop. Familiar suits. Zane squinted—it looked like the one Javier had worn. Tomb Kings?\par
There was a glut of folks standing up to them, making some commotion. There were several dozen of them. The other teams, he guessed. But the suits held firm.\par


\section{86. Valley Skirmish}
\par
What to do?\par
Zane was no seer. But it was looking to him like if he wanted to get in the dungeon, he'd have to ruffle some feathers.\par
He tried thinking it through, like Reina would’ve done.\par
Zane wasn't sure how strong the top ten World Rankers were. But if Eze was still stuck at Level 99, and he was World Ranked \#3… that wasn't such a big gap, was it?\par
He didn't have much reason to be scared of anyone. Especially with how strong his Faction was now. Maybe there was this Mike Masters, the Tomb King leader, to worry about. But he had bigger problems. Like Elias.\par
And the Tomb Kings were crawling all over Northern California. Expanding. They were going to have some kind of confrontation sooner or later, Zane figured.\par
Shrugging, he started down the slope.\par
***\par
On his way down, a Signed dot popped up on his mini-map. He drew closer, curious. He felt his feelings before he saw him. Just a tightly wound ball of nervous energy.\par
It was a short baby-faced teenage boy with curly sandy hair, eyes squeezed shut, trembling a little, sitting against a tree with his knees drawn up to his chest. "You can do this," the boy whispered. "C'mon, Evan. You’ve got this! Get up!"\par
He cringed, shivering; he was breathing pretty hard. He seemed to be having some kind of anxiety attack. "… Aw, geez… C'mon—people are counting on you down there!"\par
Evan Armstrong\par
Signature Title: Golden Boy\par
Essence Level 92\par
Huh. This boy was nearly the same Level as him. A top-20 World Ranker? Zane swore he'd seen this name before, pretty close on those ranking lists to his own.\par
…What was going on with him?\par
Zane thought briefly about saying something. He seemed in a pretty bad way. Then Zane figured it wasn't really his business. Last time he tried sticking his nose into a stranger's emotional distress, he just wound up embarrassing them so badly they literally ran away from him. For at least a mile straight, too…\par
So he kept on going, down to where the Tomb Kings were having their little standoff at the tree roots.\par
***\par
A cloud of nervous tension hung over the valley floor, growing more palpable to Zane as he neared—it poured off of lots and lots of souls. There must've been about a hundred people bunched up outside the Tomb King barricade. They were split up in seven or eight Factions. Their leaders stood at the front. Some of them had Blockers on, like him, but Zane was pretty sure they were World Rankers. They were in the midst of a hearty shouting match with a bored-looking Tomb King man.\par
"This is bullshit!” cried a nerdy-looking man in a white cloak. His fists were clenched.\par
The Tomb King man shrugged. He was a well-groomed man, lean and short, with coiffed hair in a nicely fitted suit. He wore a look of thinly disguised disdain.\par
Marco Valdez\par
Essence Level 88\par
"I'm sorry you feel that way," Marco drawled. He didn’t seem sorry in the least. "But you'll have to wait, I'm afraid. The Tomb Kings are in the middle of an operation."\par
"Hogging the dungeon, you mean," rumbled a thickly built man in a camo tank top. He was almost as tall as Zane.\par
Marco snorted. "Trust me," he said, smiling wolf-like. “You should be thanking me. Marquis Mendes is not a particularly stable man at the best of times. Now that the ice bitch killed his brother—well. He's taking it out on everything in there. Do you really want to get in the way of the World \#12?"\par
At that, they all paled a little. Then—\par
“Screw that," someone shouted. "We're World Rankers too! We took the Quest, just like you did.”\par
“That’s right!”\par
“Yeah, you tell ‘em!”\par
"You can't stop all of us!"\par
The crowd was gaining confidence.\par
"We didn't come all the way from San Antonio just to get turned back by you wannabe men-in-black assholes!" cried a tanned, muscular woman.The tale has been illicitly lifted; should you spot it on Amazon, report the violation.\par
Rosie Clarkson\par
Essence Level 80\par
She looked and dressed like an Amazon. Her Faction, a bunch of Berserkers in tunics, all nodded, looking fierce.\par
"Alright, I've heard enough," sighed Marco. "Luis? Shut her up."\par
The man next to him nodded; his bushy brows drew together. He was huge, a true giant—taller than Zane even, standing well over seven feet.\par
Luis Romero\par
Essence Level 85\par
Silently, carefully, he started rolling up his suit sleeves.\par
"Hmph.” The woman put up her fists, and burning gleaming gauntlets flashed into being. She smashed them together. "Bring it on!" she growled.\par
Smoke swirled around Luis' massive fist; when it left, he clenched an equally massive obsidian hammer.\par
He took a step. His whole body melted into shadow.\par
He emerged right in the woman’s face. The hammer came so fast she barely got her gauntlets up to block.\par
It struck. Zane saw the sheer force of it just ripple up her body, even through her guard; she gasped. Cracks jarred the clearing; she went flying, spitting blood, and flopped to a groaning stop thirty-odd feet away. She didn't get up again.\par
Stunned silence.\par
Marco checked his nails, smiling. "Ahh… much better."\par
There was a burst of shadow, and the giant was back at his side, glaring over the rest of them. A shiver passed through the crowd.\par
"So!" said Marco. "Anyone else feel like running their mouths?"\par
The crowd slowly backed away, clumping together, feeling very nervous all of a sudden. Zane blinked—it seemed it was just him still standing there.\par
“Yeah, actually,” he said. He felt a bit awkward. "I want to clear the dungeon. Could you, uh. Get out of the way?"\par
Marco frowned at him. Then snorted. "Well," he told his big lackey. "Clearly that wasn't convincing enough. Watch and learn. This is how you make an example of someone.”\par
Then he smiled. He held out his hands; long shiny knives flickered into being, smoking shadows. A lot like Javier's. He licked his lips.\par
"You have a lot of meat on you, my friend. I wonder—how many cuts will it take to get to the center of it?”\par
His knives started twirling. “Let's find out together, shall we?"\par
But before he could take another step—\par
"Hold it right there!"\par
Someone was marching up next to Zane—a Signed dot on his mini-map.\par
It was the same top-World-Ranker boy he’d seen earlier, the one cringing next to the tree. Evan Armstrong. Evan grinned, showing perfect white teeth.\par
"Golden Boy," said Marco, frowning. He pursed his lips.\par
"That's right,” said Evan. "I heard you bullies were doing your nasty business up here, so I came rushing right over! You're not hurting these folks. Not on my watch! So you can beat it, bud!"\par
It was the strangest thing. He was smiling and talking quite confidently, but Zane could feel how nervous the boy was. His heart was hammering in there.\par
It didn’t make much sense. He had four Levels on the guy and a Signature Title to boot. Zane got the impression the boy had some pretty bad performance anxiety. He hid it pretty well, though.\par
Evan turned to Zane. “Don’t worry,” he said, beaming. His grin wobbled a little. “I’ve got you. You’re safe now!”\par
Zane was speechless.\par
"Tch!" Marco scowled.\par
"So what'll it be?" Evan continued, swallowing, looking back at him. "If it's a fight you want..."\par
He drew his Soul Weapon. It looked like a blade straight out of The Lord of the Rings—sleek and pristine and bright, like something an elvish hero might wield.\par
“I’m happy to oblige. You can pick on someone your own Level, for a change!"\par
The Tomb King nailed Evan with a flat stare. “Fine. Have it your way,” he said softly. “But if you think this is over, you're sorely mistaken. The Marquis will hear of this. We'll see how smug you are when he's carving your organs out of you.”\par
“We’ll see about that!” said Evan, putting on a brave face. Though Zane felt a sudden surge of stomach-clenching fear coming from him.\par
“And you,” said Marco.\par
He turned his contemptuous half-lidded gaze on Zane and stared deeply. Like he was memorizing Zane's face. "You're a lucky man. But you owe me a duel, one way or another. I'd tread carefully around shadows if I were you. You never know what's hiding in them."\par
With that, he started to turn—\par
"Uh," said Zane. He scratched his head. "Was that a threat?"\par
Marco frowned, turned back, one elegant brow cocked.\par
"What do you think?" said the man, smirking like Zane was the stupidest person in the world. “Golden Boy here likes to play hero! But he won’t always be here to save you. And when the time comes—”\par
“Oh," said Zane.\par
He Volt Blitz'd. He had enough control now he usually ended up pretty close to where he wanted to go. In this case, he wanted to stop right in front of the Tomb King's face. He ended up pretty bang-on. His arm was already in motion by then.\par
Marco's eyes widened. His mouth opened.\par
Then his eyes went upward. So did his mouth. His whole head, really. His mouth widened, but no sound came out. The reason was pretty clear—there was a gushing of air from the molten stump of his neck, but it had nothing to connect to. The head just kept going higher and higher—then it was lost in a cloud of Stormfire. It'd roasted to a crisp before it even had a chance to fall back down.\par
A third silence in as many minutes. The most horrified silence of them all.\par
Then the giant was lunging at him, roaring in fury. His hammer swept all the way around.\par
Zane just grabbed the giant by the wrist. Almost casually. And stifled his force utterly. For a moment the giant stared in disbelief, straining all those veiny python muscles bulging up his arms. Nothing happened.\par
With his other hand, Zane grabbed the hammer shaft. And yanked it out of the man's grip like a stern parent confiscating a naughty child's toy.\par
Then he whacked him with his own Soul Weapon.\par
Maybe whack wasn't quite right. He put a good deal of effort into the swing. The hammer made a nice little arc ending at the giant's head. Short, but quite brutal. Zane got a lot of power into the swing.\par
He'd never used a hammer before, except in video games like Super Mario. It turned out to be pretty fun. It turned out pretty similar to Super Mario too. One moment the giant was about seven-and-a-half feet tall. About a quarter of a second later, he was three feet tall, squashed flat. And then he was no feet tall since the sudden compression exploded him beyond anything anyone would call living. It was pretty messy until it all dissolved into essence.\par
Then the rest of the grunts ran screaming for the Tree. They didn't get very far—the moment they got into the snarl of those huge iron roots, things started going wrong. Some got dragged straight into ground by flashes of silver light. Some got snapped clean in half by scythe-like pincers lunging out of nowhere. Zane didn't even need to do anything—he watched dot after dot vanish on his mini-map.\par
Then he turned back around. They were all gaping at him. Including Evan.\par
“Uh. Thanks for saving me back there," Zane said. “…I’ll be going now."\par


\section{87. The Power of Friendship}
\par
There was a stunned silence. The crowd of World Rankers took in what just happened with slack faces. \par
Evan stared at him, eyes shining. "Woah... you're really strong!"\par
"Thanks." Zane turned to go.\par
"Wait!"\par
He looked back, frowning. "What?"\par
But Evan wasn't there anymore. Zane felt his soul behind him. He turned again and found the boy staring up at him with wide, innocent blue eyes. When had he...?\par
He'd moved—somehow without disturbing the air. Without making a sound or leaving a trace. Zane frowned. This guy was fast, faster than that Javier even.\par
Zane didn't like fast things. Especially fast things with high Dexterity. He associated them with birds. And birds were the worst thing ever. That was just common sense.\par
He checked the boy out.\par
Evan Armstrong \par
Essence Level 92 \par
Signature Title: Golden Boy\par
Class: Lightblade\par
Key Laws:\par
Major Law of Light Speed (Elemental Law of Light)\par
Major Law of Solar Power (Elemental Law of Light) \par
Major Law of Arcane Conduction (Elemental Law of Electricity)\par
Key Skills:\par
The Power of Friendship (Passive) [Signature Skill]\par
The stronger the wielder's bonds of friendship, the more potent this Skill becomes. This Skill enhances his active Skills, as well as those of his teammates.\par
The Power of Determination (Passive) [Signature Skill]\par
When facing overwhelming odds or when protecting a friend, the wielder receives a surge in strength and vitality. This Skill does not Level.\par
Sunblade Arc (Active) [Signature Skill]\par
Conjures a blade that moves instantaneously, like a ray of light. A strike that is almost impossible to dodge. Refracts off of enemies to hit other enemies; a premier crowd control tool. \par
Mirror Dash (Active) [Epic]\par
Like light reflecting off a mirror, this Skill enables the wielder to move across the battlefield at high speed, leaving behind afterimages. Very effective for quick repositioning, dodging attacks, or closing in on distant enemies.\par
 Lightning Reflexes (Passive) [Epic]\par
Grants the wielder lightning-quick reaction time. \par
Zane did a double take. 'Power of Friendship'? 'Power of Determination'?\par
What? \par
Those didn't even sound like real Skills. \par
"You're the Savage Sage, aren't you?" said Evan.\par
"…Maybe."\par
"We're Ranking Buddies!" Evan beamed. "I'm Rank 17 and you're Rank 16. Hi, I'm Evan. It's nice to meet you!" \par
"Hi?" \par
The boy still felt nervous, but not anxiety-attack nervous like before. He came up to Zane cautiously, like he was approaching a grizzly bear to try to feed it a fish. \par
He mostly felt hopeful. \par
"I've heard all about you—you're one of the good guys!" gushed Evan. "You freed Washington from that horrible Marcus Blackwell, right? And then you freed Oregon from that demon Fire Cult up there too! Are you here to wipe out those Tomb Kings and clear this dungeon, and save Northern California once and for all?" \par
Every feeling Zane got from the boy was weirdly pure. Quite vivid too. He was just full of earnest hope. With pretty much everyone else, Zane felt a little dark undertone—maybe some greed or deception lurking in the back of their mind. Evan felt like a puppy or something. \par
Zane didn't know what to do with him. \par
"Uh. I am not one of the 'good guys,'" Zane clarified hastily. He didn't even know what that was supposed to mean. "I like clearing dungeons. That's it. Marcus and the Cult just… happened to be in the way."\par
Evan blinked. "But… you're here to clear this dungeon too, right? And save Northern California once and for all?" He said hopefully.\par
"I mean. I'm here to clear the dungeon," said Zane. He still wasn't sure what the boy's game was.\par
"Great!" The boy's earnest smile came back on in full force. \par
"We should team up. I have this Skill. It's called… uh…" he flushed a little. "Nevermind that. Basically, it's a team-buff skill. We'll be stronger together—and we'll also have a better chance of clearing the dungeon, and saving—"\par
"Northern California once and for all. Right."\par
"Exactly!" Evan beamed. "Ooh—that reminds me." \par
He looked around at the rest of them. "Hey everyone!" He said. "We should all team up and go together. That way we'll have the best chance of clearing the dungeon! And we can watch each other's backs along the way, too, so none of us get hurt. What do you say?"\par
The World Rankers exchanged skeptical glances. \par
Zane got the impression saving Northern California once and for all was not the highest thing on their list of priorities. \par
The burly Faction leader in a camo tank top—Marcus Washington, a Geomancer of the Colorado Loggers Faction—spoke up. And said what was on all of their minds. \par
"So. Say we do clear this thing together," he said. "Who gets the rewards?"\par
"And what if we come across a treasure chest?" said another Faction Leader. "What then?" \par
"Oh," said Evan, blinking. He looked taken aback. Like the thought hadn't occurred to him. "Well, uh… I guess we can just split whatever we get evenly among all of us. That sounds fair, doesn't it?"\par
They did not like that answer. Zane got the sense the only split they liked was the one where they got all the treasures to themselves. \par
"You guys can have my share. I don't need it." Evan smiled sheepishly. "I don't really care about that stuff." If you discover this narrative on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.\par
That only made them more skeptical. And they were plenty skeptical already.\par
You didn't need Sage Mind to sense the mood in the clearing. Looking at their dubious faces, Evan wilted a little. You could see him deflating in real-time. He just looked embarrassed. He started playing with a curl of hair. "Or… not… that's fine too…" he mumbled. \par
Zane winced. The boy felt crushed.\par
"Yeah," rumbled Marcus Washington. "We're good on our own. Thanks for the offer, kid." \par
He gave a little two-finger salute, and his band of a dozen or so marched off.\par
The Lightning Mage, the Ranger, even the Berserker lady who'd gotten walloped shuffled off too. The rest of the World Rankers followed suit. \par
"If—if anyone wants to join me, I'm still here! …Anyone?” \par
No one took him up on it.\par
Evan was left standing there alone. \par
...He was taking it pretty bad. Zane could feel exactly how bad. There were tears in the boy's eyes by the end of it. \par
Zane just sighed. \par
"Uh," he said for reasons he couldn't fully understand.\par
Sniffling, Evan looked up. "No—it's okay, I get it," he mumbled, putting up a wobbly smile. "It was really nice meeting you."\par
"That's not what I mean. You...you can come with me." \par
Evan blinked. "Wait… really?" \par
And he felt such a surge of pure joy Zane literally had to take a step back—it felt like staring directly at the sun.\par
Zane used to be totally insensitive to his own feelings, much less others'. Now he had Sage Mind it sometimes felt overwhelming being around people. He felt things he never usually felt. He couldn't help picking it up—like overhearing in a crowd.\par
And this Evan felt things more vividly than pretty much anyone he'd met. It was disorienting at times. \par
"Thank you, thank you, thank you!" beamed Evan. "You won't regret this!"\par
"One condition," Zane said.\par
"Mhm!" \par
"I'm here to kill Monsters. Don't mess with my kills. Stay out of my way."\par
Evan nodded vigorously. "You got it. Can do!” \par
*** \par
They made their way toward the tree, and soon they crossed the faint translucent blue wall that marked the dungeon boundary.\par
You have entered Dungeon: Titansteel Tree \par
Boss: Titansteel Treant \par
Clearance Condition: Slay the Titansteel Treant \par
(0/1) \par
This dungeon's boundaries contain only the Titansteel Tree. The area between the ground and the canopy is a No-Fly zone.\par
"Just one Boss, huh," Zane muttered. \par
"Mhm. That's how some of these B-rank dungeons are," said Evan. "But the catch is, a lot of their 'normal' Monsters are like C-rank dungeon Bosses! So it ends up being way more dangerous. Plus there's all the traps and stuff. But yeah—clear the Final Boss, and we're good." \par
Zane grunted acknowledgment. \par
He assumed it waited for him at the tippy top of this thing. He couldn't even see the highest canopy from down here—it was lost beyond the cloud layer.\par
As Zane crossed the border, the full extent of the boundary briefly showed. It was lair-lock blue, running over the ground floor before curving up near the edge of the trunk. Then he passed the threshold, and it went invisible again. \par
So you couldn't just fly from the bottom to the top. You had to actually climb the thing. \par
He looked up that great trunk, ridged with thousands of passageways, puffed with canopies stuffed with metallic leaves.... \par
It was so vast, so weird, it felt like setting foot in some other world. \par
***\par
The Tree roots loomed ahead of him. They looked like elephant trunks laid out—but much bigger, colored a brown-streaked metallic grey. They rose up to meet the tree trunk maybe a mile away, tangling all over each other. \par
He saw the routes going between them on the mini-map. From a birds-eye view it looked like a maze. There seemed to be plenty of ways through this mess. And plenty of routes up the tree once you got there, too.\par
All of them were smothered in red dots. All the way through. Zane didn't see any Monsters—at least not immediately up ahead. Were they underground or something? \par
"Woah…" gasped Evan, looking straight up, blinking at the foliage. "It's beautiful."\par
One route looked as good as another. So he just started walking, and Evan followed happily behind him. Their steps swished through ankle-high grass.\par
Something about this place felt odd to him. And it wasn't just how big everything was. There was a constant low-level noise. Not sound noise—soul noise. He felt it spread up from the ground as though a crowd hid under the dirt. He felt noise pouring out from either side of him too, from those giant roots… \par
Something caught his ankle. \par
He hadn't felt it coming. Or rather he had—but it was lost in so much soul noise he might as well have felt nothing at all. He frowned down and found a spiky shiny silver vine thick as a python coiling around his leg. \par
Titansteel Root (Monster)\par
Essence Level 75\par
Then it tried yanking him under. \par
It didn't get very far. With a flicker of will he was a heavy block of Spirit Steel. Frowning, he tried jerking himself out. It was surprisingly hard. He raised his arm to slash at the thing, but before he could, it slithered away whip-quick. \par
“…” \par
He kept walking, frowning. A few seconds later, another lashed him so hard he almost tripped. When he went to cut it, it was gone. \par
 \par
Zane stopped moving. He just frowned at the ground, waiting for one of these stupid ground birds to show its face again. It didn't. \par
Then he started walking, and a vine caught him mid-step. \par
It got him knee-deep into the ground before he yanked his leg back out. Before he could throw in a Rising Storm Slash, the earth closed back up. \par
"Are you okay?!" cried Evan, pattering up to him. \par
"Yeah," grunted Zane. It was just annoying. He frowned up. Could you walk on top of this root-maze? Only for a little. Soon as you got a few hundred feet in you ran up against the Lair Lock ceiling. \par
He decided to just ignore the ground birds. Whatever. \par
He tripped and stumbled the next hundred feet or so, getting more and more annoyed. \par
Then came a buzzing. It got louder the deeper they went, rattling down the giant root-walls. They made a turn and saw the source of it. \par
Steelfang Locust Swarm (Monster) \par
Essence Level 86\par
There were so many little red-tipped dots hovering there he couldn't even make them out. Just a vibrating cloud of black and red. He blinked. \par
 \par
Then they rushed him all at once. And the stinging began. \par
They were getting in his nose. They were getting in his eyes, his ears, stabbing teensy burning needles up all up and down his body, and he roared and they got in his throat too. He started to gag. Rising Storm Slash! It ripped out a chunk of them. There was a beautiful glorious burning; then more took their place. \par
Freaking bug birds! \par
They weren't even doing anything real. Their stings did almost nothing to his body. His health was still well over 90\%. They were just... \par
That's it. \par
He got out his Axes. He felt a little ridiculous busting out Stormfire Cyclone for some stupid flies, but he'd do it, damnit— \par
His world exploded in light. He felt powerful brilliant Laws envelop him. Never touching him, just arching around him, making a spiderweb of light. \par
Then the bugs were gone. Roasted to a crisp. Turning to essence, floating into a cringing Evan. \par
"Sorry!" he said. "I... I know you said not to get in your way, but—" \par
 "No," said Zane, blinking. "No. This is good. You can kill birds?" \par
"What?" \par
"Little annoying things that don't do anything," Zane clarified. \par
"I… think so?" \par
"You do that," said Zane. "I will beat up the strong things. You have permission to kill all birds." \par
 \par
"Oh. Okay." Evan saluted like a Boy Scout. "Will do!" \par
 \par
They kept going. Ten steps later Zane felt a ripple of Law go by his feet. He looked down. \par
There lay a severed Titansteel Root. The other half squirmed trembling back into its hole. \par
Zane stared at Evan.\par
"Was—was that okay?" Evan said nervously. \par
"How did you do that?" \par
"Oh! I dunno. Reflexes, I guess?" \par
Zane kept staring. He saw it now. The truth. You had to use a bird to beat a bird. Evan was a very good bird. \par
"I like you." \par
Evan flushed; he scratched the back of his head. "Aw, geez…"\par
They kept going. \par
Zane got the sense Evan was capable of a lot more than just pest cleanup. Like driving a Lamborghini exclusively in a Walmart parking lot. Some of Evan's Skills made him sound… important? \par
But Zane was happy with his performance, so he saw no need to change things. \par
Fifty steps and a sharp turn later, they ran up against what Zane considered their first real Monster. \par
\par


\section{88. Titansteel Beetle}
\par
Two unusually large dots were coming around the bend. They sounded like tanks—the earth groaned under them as they moved.\par
They moved like tanks too—slowly, steadily. Then they came into view.\par
Titansteel Beetle (Monster)\par
Essence Level 88\par
Key Laws\par
Major Law of Undying Might (Elemental Law of Steel) \par
Major Law of Steel Density (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
Major Law of Echoing Clangor (Elemental Law of Steel) \par
Key Skills:\par
Titansteel Shell (Passive) [Epic]\par
A shell forged of Titansteel, woven through with Major Laws. This shell is among the densest Mortal-Grade materials, incredibly heavy, and immensely durable to all forms of attack.\par
Clangor Bite (Active) [Epic]\par
A crushing bite that resonates at a high frequency, creating a sonic vibration that dramatically elevates its scything powers. This Bite can chew through blocks of low-grade Spirit Steel. \par
They even looked like tanks. It was like their body—from that shiny oval shell to their scythes for pincers to their spiky pillars for legs—was one huge suit of gunmetal-gray armor. Metal spines ran down their shells. Their eyes flared deep red.\par
Those eyes were the only weak points that came up in Sage Mind. Their defense was nearly flawless. They made a ringing click-click-clicking as they came for him. Their pincers gnashed together, screeching steel.\par
Three Major Laws, huh. And he hadn't even gotten to the Tree yet. This dungeon was something else.\par
He mulled what to do. He could probably bust out his Axes and give these things a hiding.\par
But Zane looked at those Major Laws again. Steel Density. Echoing Clangor. He didn't have either of those. And he'd need them to make the Elemental Law of Steel…\par
"Hey Zane, what are you thinking?" said Evan, swallowing.\par
Zane could feel the boy's nervousness, but it was hard to tell if he was actually scared or if it was just his usual.\par
Zane cracked his knuckles.\par
"Um. Zane?" A little higher pitched now.\par
Zane smiled. "Don't interfere. No matter what happens. Got it?"\par
"Um—"\par
He marched toward the monsters. Let's go. He set his fists on fire. Stormfire.\par
Skill learned!\par
Stormfire Punch [Epic]\par
Oh. Nice.\par
The Beetles opened their maws and ungodly sounds came out, like glass shattering mixed with nails on a chalkboard.\par
They charged him like rhinos. And he gave that same energy right back. He leaped in, fist flying, and brought it smashing down right in the middle of a thick, shiny head.\par
It blasted a crater in its skull a foot deep. A crater that burst into crackling flame.\par
It did less than he thought, actually. That Titansteel shell was pretty darn thick. And he felt its Laws fighting his Stormfire. He felt Undying Might in there but also something else—was that Steel Density? It clumped everything together at the tiniest level, made the Titansteel stupidly heavy, hard to chew through… his Stormfire was still making a nice little puddle in the middle of its head, but slower than usual.\par
Zane squinted at it. Up this close, he could almost pick the Laws apart…\par
The Beetle bucked, turned, tried throwing him off. But it really was like a tank—it didn't have much liftoff. He could just about hold on.\par
Until a shadow loomed over him. Or rather, two shadows stretching all the way around him. The silhouette of a pincer. Zane frowned.\par
He could feel the second Beetle right behind him. Feel its seething hatred. It badly wanted to crush him, to rip him in half. The pincers yawned wide, dropping to snap him up—\par
Was this that 'Clangor Bite' Skill? With that Law of Echoing Clangor? This could be interesting, actually.\par
They closed in on him like guillotines—and chomped into his skin. It only got half an inch or so in. Enough to draw blood. But not enough to fold him.\par
Then its real power poured into him, and he choked a little. It felt like his whole body was a big gong, and something just struck him. Hard. His head felt like it was about to explode. His teeth were chattering out of his skull—damn. His vision was a jittering blur; he felt the jarring buzzing trembling down in his bones. Everything shook.A case of theft: this story is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\par
He heard Evan scream somewhere in the background.\par
Now, the pincers were pouring quite a lot of force into him. But with Zane's body, a lot was not enough. Yet… they were still making steady progress. Cutting into him bit by bit, digging deep into the muscle. Pain flared up on either side. Huh.\par
It was the vibrations. They were destabilizing him, physically, structurally. His Health was actually starting to take a real hit. This was really interesting. It felt like the kind of Minor Law that could apply to a lot of stuff, not just steel—\par
Zane blinked. There was Evan right there in front of him, flying through the air, sword held high. The boy's mouth was open in a valiant cry. His body was a little sun of anger and determination; the feelings just shone out of him, blinding. He glowed a golden light. His eyes were literally shining.\par
"Let go of my friend!" He cried, and the sword flashed down.\par
And in that slash, there was an immense surge of essence—far more than Zane would've thought the boy could muster. This was the kind of blow even Zane would have to take very seriously.\par
An arc of light split the air, sliced right through the Beetle's neck—and beheaded the beast in a stroke.\par
It kept going, crashed into the roots behind, and sank a shining scar into the wood-steel.\par
The pincers came loose and dissolved.\par
There stood Evan, trembling a little, heaving in huge gulps of air. The shot seemed to take a lot out of him. Worry poured out of him. "Are you okay?!"\par
Zane frowned. "Why did you do that?"\par
"….huh?"\par
Zane started to explain. But the other Beetle was charging him, so he sighed. "One moment."\par
The pincers flashed down. And he grabbed them.\par
Then in one big heave, he picked the Monster up. Its long chunky legs thrashed about, trying to shake itself free, but he held firm. It was surprisingly hard to hold—even for Zane. Must be those Density Laws. If Zane found it heavy, it was pretty darn heavy.\par
Then he turned it upside down and dropped it. It cratered into the dirt. There it spasmed, kicking wildly at the air, pincers angrily snapping at nothing. But it couldn't seem to right itself—its shell, armor, whatever, was just too heavy. It kept rolling side to side like a big angry rocking horse. It was kind of funny to watch.\par
Evan just stared.\par
"I let it bite me," Zane explained. "It has Steel Laws I want to learn. I'm trying to feel them."\par
"…Ohhhh." Evan flushed. "Oh! Um. I'm—I'm so sorry! I just thought—"\par
"It's fine," said Zane, waving a casual hand. "There's Beetles to spare. It's not easy to hurt me. Unless I ask for help, assume I'm fine."\par
"Okay. Got it." Evan nodded seriously. "It won't happen again, I swear!"\par
He had this determined look on his face like he was committing it to heart. Zane thought about emphasizing again that it really wasn't that big a deal. He gave up.\par
"How did you do that anyway? The slash."\par
Evan blinked. Then he looked at the root-wall, which was still simmering with his essence, a little baffled. Like he was thinking—that was me?\par
"Well …I can't do it," he said sheepishly. "I mean I can—just not with that much, um, power. I have this Skill where if I'm defending a friend, I get a power boost." He mumbled that last bit. For some reason, he felt a little embarrassed.\par
...They were friends?\par
Hmm. Zane supposed he didn't mind. Evan was alright.\par
He turned back to the flailing Beetle. It was losing its mind a little. He could feel its growing panic. "Don't interfere."\par
"Mhm!"\par
He took this chance to take a C-grade Law fruit. Then he grabbed hold of those steely pincers and flipped the thing back over.\par
It came at him even angrier this time. Which worked out well, actually. It clamped its pincers around him, trying furiously to shred him. And he just focused on the feeling. This really was useful—for this particular Law he could literally feel it, and deeply, too. He just lay there and soaked it in.\par
The Beetle was like a dog gnawing on a bone—it just wouldn't let go. It was actually kind of impressive. After half a minute or so of scant progress, most beasts would have tried something new. But this thing was just raw, dumb hate.\par
Zane closed his eyes. He started slipping away, finding his Law trance. The more he did it, the easier it was to slip into it. He relaxed his body. He let his mind drift off. He forgot the screeching of steel on steel, the hateful beady eyes glaring at him, the screeching gnawing sounds, the sharp burning feelings of his muscles starting to shred… A bit of the thing's acid slobber got in his face, which took him out of it for a moment. But that was all.\par
Soon he was deep in. He felt the Law rippling through him—felt the way steel vibrated, the way those waves sought out points of weakness, made little disruptions at the tiniest of levels, where everything held together—made things weak and brittle…\par
Warning! Health under 75\%!\par
Then—\par
Law comprehended! Minor Law of Resonant Vibrations\par
Hey, nice. \par
The thing was still coming at him pretty hard. Its jaws were nearing bone, which would have been a little inconvenient. Zane was pretty good about not letting stuff affect him. But even for him it'd be hard keeping his mind still, a clear pond without ripples, once his bones started breaking.\par
So he pushed back a little. He shimmied up so the pincers clamped a little lower on him—on fresh unbroken meat. The deep wounds on his upper arms, meanwhile, burned up with Fiery Renewal. Healing.\par
Satisfied, he sank back into his trance.\par
It seemed the Beetle was getting frustrated—it started ramming him into the root wall too. But he didn't care. He had a very thick skull.\par
With this vibration came a sound, he noticed. The vibrations and the sounds were intertwined at a very deep level. They added a new layer to the cutting. They started from the pincers and poured into him… He felt the way they shifted a little, bent, slowed, as they moved from the steel of the pincer to the steel of his body. And then from him out into open air… He felt the way sound moved through steel, and soon he knew it.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Sonic Refraction\par
Warning!\par
Health under 50\%\par
Savage Body Activated!\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Those were the most prominent Minor Laws in this attack, at least. He could sense there were more Echoing Clangor Minor Laws in there—hidden undertones—but it would take some digging to sieve out. One of them also had to do with steel and sound, he sensed, but it was a little murkier…\par
He frowned.\par
The pressure was easing up. What?\par
The Beetle let go of him and put its head down. Its huge shell rose and fell, like it was breathing heavy. It'd stopped clicking.\par
Zane reached out, baffled. Then he felt the reason.\par
…Was this thing for real?\par
Its jaw got tired.\par
What kind of Monster was this? That was it?\par
"Pathetic," he sighed.\par
He brought out his Axe, licked its edge with Stormfire, and caved its head in with a stroke. He'd just find another one. There were probably plenty around.\par
He found Evan staring at him, eyes shining. Not literally this time. “Woahh…"\par
"What?"\par
“Zane, you're really cool!" he said earnestly.\par
"…Thanks?"\par
Evan kind of reminded him of Avery, weirdly. Except… the opposite? At this point she'd be making fun of him. But they were both… he wasn't sure how to describe it.\par
Anyway.\par
They moved on. Soon they stumbled across a treasure chest buried in the root wall.\par


\section{89. Titansteel Beetle King}
\par
He might not have spotted the treasure chest if it wasn’t marked on the mini-map. It was made of Titansteel, the same stuff as the root wall it was buried in. Silver vines snaked over its surface, strapping it in. Thick Spirit Steel straps buffed its frame, latching it tight.\par
Zane studied it for a second. Then he grabbed the sides of it and heaved.\par
For a moment nothing happened.\par
Then the whole root wall began to shake. Inch by inch the chest came free. Vines snapped off of it like rubber bands. Then he had it all the way clear and dropped it thudding to the ground. He grabbed the latches and tore them off one by one. He ripped open the lid with his bare hands—a little too hard. The whole thing went flying over the root wall. Oops. \par
He felt a prickling of feeling to the left and looked over. “What?”\par
Evan had been staring at him quite a lot this past hour. The boy flinched. “Nothing!”\par
Granting, he turned his attention to the chest’s insides. There he found a single vial on a bed of lustrous straw. It was stoppered with light-green wood and tied with a vine for a ribbon. It was surprisingly heavy for such a small thing. Its glass was stamped with a crest showing a stylized tree. \par
A turquoise liquid shot through with gold flecks sloshed inside.\par
Jadeleaf’s Elixir of Talent (B)\par
Distilled over three months by Jade Leaf, apprentice Alchemist of the Temple of the World Tree, from the essence of Moonflower Petals and rare Flameroot. The natural synergies stimulate the body, making it unusually receptive to essence for a brief time. Performs the equivalent effect of raising one’s Leveling Talent by four minor grades. Certified by Master Spring Rain. Cooldown time: 2 months \par
Temple of the World Tree? That rang a bell… wasn’t that where Reina’s Signature Title came from? Either this was a funky coincidence, or they were a pretty big deal. \par
And Minor grades? Leveling talent?\par
There was talent in Leveling?\par
Now that Zane thought about it, it did seem some people just Leveled slower than others. Even if they took in the same essence. It was clear you didn't get all the essence from Monsters you killed, just a fraction of it. Maybe talent just meant a bigger fraction?\par
Zane wondered how high his talent was. Was there some way to check? \par
Hmm. \par
Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted movement. It was Evan, tugging on one of the root vines. It didn't budge. He planted a foot on the root wall and tugged harder. Nothing happened.\par
“Dang,” the boy whispered, wide-eyed.\par
“You ready?” Said Zane.\par
“Huh? Oh! Yup—be right there!”\par
They kept on down the winding path.\par
***\par
They met another Titansteel Beetle. It chomped on Zane for a little and he got a little closer to that last Minor Law he needed for Echoing Clangor. But it wasn’t quite enough. Its Clangor Bite Skill might use the Major Law of Echoing Clangor, but it used some parts much more than others. The third Minor Law he needed was so subtle it escaped him. For now.\par
Zane sighed and squished the Monster. He'd probably just find some time to sit down and grind it out himself later. Maybe with some Steel treasure to help.\par
***\par
They were getting close to the tree trunk now. They could sense it looming over them—they were lost in its shade. You couldn't even see the topmost canopy from down here—just its shadow, a giant umbrella drawing a deep dark circle over the clouds. \par
But the sunlight wasn't all blocked. Zane guessed the giant canopy up there was like the boughs he could see down here—made of the same shiny metallic leaves. They were pretty darn reflective. \par
Shafts of sunlight streaked through the clouds, drawing shifting gold patterns on the ground. Zane guessed from all the leaves up there, catching the light of the sun, pinging it down. Pretty weird-looking stuff. Not often you saw sunlight through almost-black clouds.\par
He heard a gasp next to him. There was Evan, stood still, staring mouth wide open.\par
Zane stared too—not at the clouds but at Evan. Zane frowned a little. Wonder and joy just poured out of the boy; his heart swelled with it.\par
Zane looked at the clouds again, wondering what he was missing. Then back at Evan.\par
Evan noticed him looking, glanced over curiously. \par
“Why are you so…” Zane wasn't even sure how to phrase it. “Happy?”\par
The boy didn't seem to understand. He just pointed at the sky, all excited. “Isn't it pretty?”Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.\par
He went back to staring.\par
Huh.\par
How could you feel like that, just looking at sunlight coming through clouds? Evan felt as happy right now as Zane did in his fiercest fights.\par
Zane scratched his head. Sometimes he wished he could be the kind of person who could be happy looking at sunlight through clouds. He figured life would be nicer that way. He could feel how Evan felt—it was like seeing the world in color, where Zane’s was monochrome.\par
Just being next to him let Zane feel as he felt. Not as strongly. Just an impression, but it was still nice. \par
He sat there, staring for a bit, and after a while, he started to see it. …It really was nice to look at.\par
After a while, they moved on.\par
***\par
A few bends later, they came across a swath of X’s on the mini-map. And Evan gasped there too. He went sad suddenly, sobered up.\par
“You okay?” Said Zane.\par
Evan nodded slowly. “Mhm.”\par
Zane was actually curious. He was still a little confused about how Evan was even a thing. You'd have thought the Apocalypse would’ve chewed him up and spat him out all jaded by now.\par
But the boy just shook his head and swallowed, and when he looked back up, his eyes were fierce.\par
“We have to keep going,” he said. “So their lives won't be in vain!” And he was full of determination again.\par
Huh. \par
 They kept moving.\par
***\par
Soon, they were nearing the end of the root-path. Coming up to the trunk. And there, they found a fat red dot waiting for them, guarding the tunnel going in.\par
It was like the Titansteel Beetles grew up. You’d never see a tank like this before the change—just too big, too unwieldy. Its pincers could’ve snapped a house in two. And that shell was smoking with Steel Laws. \par
Titansteel Beetle King (Boss Monster) \par
Essence Level 95\par
Laws: \par
Major Law of Undying Might \par
Major Law of Steely Density\par
 Major Law of Absolute Sharpness \par
Major Law of Echoing Clangor \par
Key Skills: \par
Great Titansteel Shell (Passive) [Epic]\par
A doubly thick Titansteel shell immensely resistant to all forms of attack, magical and physical. Twice as difficult to penetrate as any normal Titalsteel Beetle shell.\par
Titansteel Crush (Active) [Epic]\par
A crush which combines incredible sharpness with the crushing, high-frequency scything of a typical Clangor Bite. This Bite can chew through blocks of mid-grade Spirit Steel. \par
Titansteel Swarm Call (Active) [Epic]\par
 Calls all Titansteel Beetles within a several-hundred-foot radius to serve its bidding. \par
So pretty similar to the normal Beetles. Just bigger and stronger. \par
It regarded Zane silently. Its eyes were one flat shade of deep red. Like dried blood.\par
This one had a few Levels on him, too, and four Major Laws. Its Crush seemed a little different, a little better than the others’… he wondered if it’d help him get that last Minor Law. \par
He wondered if it was such a good idea to screw around with something this big.\par
Then he looked at Evan, shuffling nervously side by side.\par
Yeah. Worst case, he’d still be fine.\par
“Wait here,” said Zane. Then he marched up to the thing. And it pounced. \par
It moved shockingly quickly for something that big; it launched off six giant legs, kicking up geysers of dirt. It’d snatched him up in a blink like he weighed nothing, seized him between pincers big as cruise-ship anchors. Then it started to crush. \par
Zane felt Echoing Clangor rev up again, felt that world-shaking rattling—but much worse than before. It felt like an earthquake was going off in his body. At the same time, those great blades ripped into him. He tried to go into his Zen state, tried losing himself to his trance.\par
This thing was squeezing pretty darn hard. \par
Then he heard something crack. It seemed to be his arm.\par
Warning! \par
Health under 75\%\par
Ah, shit. Alright. Time to bail.\par
Zane flexed, putting brute strength against brute strength, trying to force open its jaws. It put up some good resistance. He had to really grunt and grind his way through, little by little. The thing was damned strong. It took all his strength—at last with a furious roar he broke free, wrenched its pincers wide. He leaped out and tumbled to a sorry gasping halt. He was bleeding quite a bit, but Fiery Renewal was already licking up the wounds.\par
The Beetle King didn't follow. Instead it raised its head. And its pincers began to tremble.\par
This sound came out of it—the steely buzzing, sweeping the air… and dots started pouring in at the edges of his mini-map. It was using that swarm caller Skill. But Zane just stared.\par
He’d been searching in the wrong place this whole time. There it was! He let his mind fade out a little, reach out to it at the level of the soul, tried taking it into him… that Law Fruit he'd eaten was quickly running out. But he managed to squeeze out what he needed.\par
He heard the way it buzzed… and the way its buzzing brought out new buzzing all around him, until the world was alive with it—he felt it in himself, even… \par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Steel Harmonies (Elemental Law of Steel) \par
He had everything now for the Major Law of Echoing Clangor. He just needed to put them together. Soon—not now. Now the ground was trembling as dozens of hulking bodies closed in on him, climbing over those root walls, crawling up from behind.\par
“Evan,” said Zane calmly. “I need you to run. Go as far as you can.”\par
“No!” cried the boy. He shook his head vigorously. “I won't leave you! If you're staying, I'm staying too—ow…”\par
Zane had flicked him in the head.\par
“This isn't some heroic last stand or something,” Zane sighed. “I just plan on using some messy Skills. I don't want to hit you on accident.”\par
“Oh.” Evan blinked. “When should I come back?”\par
The beetle king had ended its call; its head was snapping back down, like a bull preparing to charge.\par
“When they're all dead.”\par
“Oh. Um. Okay.” He hesitated for a bit. He felt concerned. In the end he decided to trust Zane. “I’m rooting for you!” he said. \par
“Thanks.” \par
Evan sped off. \par
Then Zane took out that Talent Elixir and downed it in two heavy gulps. His whole body felt warm with it, suddenly electric-tingly. Four minor grades, huh. \par
He raised his hands and his Axes crashed to earth, shivering with Stormfire.\par
Stormfire Cyclone was Level 2 after the evolution. He hadn't really gotten a chance to test it out yet. He wondered how strong it was now.\par
He took a quick breath.\par
Then he raised his hands. And his Axes began to spin.\par
\par


\section{90. Echoing Clangor}
\par
One revolution and a circle of Stormfire sparked up. Two and they started to rise, twisting in the beginnings of a cyclone.\par
Then the Beetles made contact.\par
His Axe struck one and cleaved right through. Caught it around the neck and wrenched its head from its body. There was a brilliant flash, a blinding blast of red and yellow. The Axes kept going, cleaving a second, a third— and both erupted in giant crackling balls of lightning and fire, limbs spasming, grinding to sudden halts.\par
Each time he hit one of them, his Axe made a CLANG! And each time, their momentum stuttered a little. Cleaving through blocks of incredibly dense steel tended to do that. Zane forced his way through another revolution, and now they were swarming him in full—CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, went his Axes. Sparks flew. Heads flew like giant saucers. Pole-like limbs wheeled through the air.\par
He was wrecking them pretty well one by one. The problem was at this rate, he'd never get a true cyclone going. And he needed that to slay the swarm. If anything his Axes were losing momentum. No good. These things were just too thick and heavy. Even if he got to the 7th, 8th, and 9th revolutions, could his winds really suck them in? He was having trouble imagining lifting all these hulking things off the ground…\par
Then the Beetle King stepped in. And his Axes sank straight into it.\par
CLANG! CLANG!\par
The blast nearly took him off his feet. When he steadied himself, blinked the spots from his eyes, he saw his Axes sunken halfway through that bulging Titansteel shell. Deep enough to make the Beetle King spasm and rain acid spittle.\par
Not enough to kill it though.\par
Yeah. It was looking like he'd need a change of tactics. Sage Mind told him these things were weak in just one spot: the eyes. So that was where he'd aim.\par
The first Beetle reached him, and he lashed out with an Axe and put a Rising Storm Slash right through a big red eye. He was precise with it—only the eye. So when it made contact, when it exploded, all that essence roared straight through. And roasted it in a sudden blitz.\par
There was a scorched pit where its eye used to be. The Beetle keeled over, hissing as Stormfire ate on through, followed the weakness downward and found the flesh underneath. It raced down thick optic nerves, catching on muscle and bone. It started cooking the thing from the inside.\par
Zane leaped aside as it barreled past him; he slashed out the eyes of another. Then they were all on him, all trying to get a piece of him. There were eight or nine of them ganging up on him at once— it was just too crowded, too much to take in.\par
He breathed out deeply. And closed his eyes. Vision was too much noise right now— he reached out at the level of the soul. Sage Mind!\par
He poured all of his concentration on this one moment. He had to know all of them at once. He had to map all their shifting twisting feelings to the real world. It was hugely straining.\par
He shifted his head a foot to the left. A pincer whistled by that would've sliced off an ear. He spun, swung his Axe, and carved out a set of bug eyes. Then he ducked under, feeling the air whistling, buzzing above him. At the same time he lifted a leg; a pincer rippled through where his knee had been. He sliced the Beetle behind-and-to-the-left, felt a satisfying shock of pain, dropped into a somersault. He came back up just in time to see the Beetles on either side of him running into each other, pincers colliding like the horns of dueling stags.\par
And while they were tangled up, he Axed them both.\par
Now things were really looking post-apocalyptic. Dying beetles were scattered everywhere, lying there spasming, insides burning in their steel frames. It looked like a street of cars on fire. Ugly, demented cars, slowly melting. Silver pooled at their feet.\par
But a horde was still coming at him.\par
A pincer struck from the left. Then from the right, then under, then back left. He kept dodging, kept slashing. He was a little astounded by himself. He wasn't moving particularly well—some of these dodges were just him stumbling out of reach—but they worked, mostly. He was saved by the fact that even though his Dexterity was pretty low, these things were clumsy too. So it kind of evened out.\par
Until it didn't.\par
Just because you felt something coming didn't mean you could stop it. He felt a pincer coming left, and one coming right, and one coming front, and one coming back. All at once. And really, there were only so many directions. He tried going up, but that meant he was hanging in the air. Hard to move much then.\par
So he could only watch, pretty much, as the Beetle King's pincers yawned up and clamped deep into him.\par
And once that thing got a bite, it was all over.\par
The others latched onto him too. He felt pain stabbing up his legs. No less than four sets of pincers grabbed hold of his torso. Another tried sawing off his head. It wasn't even the pain, which was pretty bad. It was all the weight. The Beetles were just dogpiling on him; he had to bear the weight of a skyscraper.\par
The force was incredible. He'd never felt anything like it. It was a challenge.\par
Zane roared—not with pain or fear, but with the thrill of it. He was smiling, his blood was running furious hot. He flexed with all he had; he gave it everything. He knew he was strong. Even he didn't know just how strong.\par
He managed to make an inch of space. Shoving all that unfathomably huge mass back… and hit a wall. Not of the mind, but of the flesh.This tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.\par
Then, for the first time in as long as he could remember, his body failed him. His mind was straining with the effort, doing all it could; his body tried and tried. It was pretty surprising in real time. It'd been so long since he'd been overpowered… he wasn't sure it'd happened after the Change.\par
He lost ground inch by inch. Until he had no ground to give anymore.\par
And then they just started shredding him.\par
Fuck.\par
The vibrations were almost unbearable too. They made it very hard to think.\par
On the one hand, they were a surprisingly great demonstration of the Major Law of Echoing Clangor. They were literally beating the knowledge into him.\par
On the other hand, they were doing a very effective job of killing him.\par
Fine then. If they insisted on holding on to him, they also insisted on making themselves sitting ducks.\par
So when his Axes sliced down again they gored two or three at a time. Slashing out their eyes, pouring in his Stormfire. And soon their insides were turning to liquid.\par
But the bastards were still holding on. It was a race. He just had to burn them out before they—\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%!\par
Oh boy.\par
He couldn't move anymore. It took every ounce of strength just to stop them from killing him. And his health was just dropping like a rock.\par
There was nothing he could do but keep pouring in essence. It was a pretty ridiculous race. They were like two snakes trying to swallow each other, locked in place, just struggling mightily—which would go down first?\par
It was looking like him… he was getting dangerously near 50\%, and these things weren't letting up. Especially not that Beetle King. But Zane had an idea.\par
… But first, he had to get beat up a little more—\par
Warning!\par
Health under 50\%!\par
Savage Body Activated!\par
Vitality Increased 25\%\par
Speed Increased 25\%\par
Strength Increased 25\%\par
There we go.\par
And Zane flexed, and screamed, and gave it all he had.\par
Still not enough to get them off him—not even close. It would have been especially hard now that his muscles were pretty shredded. But that wasn't what he aimed for. He just needed to make a little space.\par
A little space to slot a Chain through, wedging against his sides, blocking off those razor-sharp pincers. And now they were chewing on hard steel rather than soft arm flesh.\par
Make no mistake—he was still feeling the force of it pretty bad. But at least it was blunted now. And in this kind of race, every little bit mattered. Fiery renewal got to work on him, trying to salvage what it could of his crumpled-up body.\par
He'd seen one of those hydraulic press videos on YouTube once. No matter what you put under that thing—a car, a safe, a diamond, they all got crushed eventually. That was what came to mind right now. He was a pretty big guy. They really wanted to put him in a tiny space. And it was starting to hurt. Bad. At this point he couldn't even breathe. He could feel his ribs start to crack under the pressure, one by one.\par
But the Beetles were slowing too. A few of the pincers started loosening as massive heads melted straight off their bodies. They were dense as hell, but they were still starting to drop off. Everything was lit up with Stormfire. He wondered what the pile-up looked like on the outside. Just a giant funeral pyre with him in the middle.\par
The King was the main problem. It was stronger than the rest of them, and its crush was like 4 of theirs combined—and it wasn't letting up for anything.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 25\%\par
Zane started vomiting blood. Involuntarily. But the pincers around his legs were loosening. The ones clamping his head clattered off. And then it was just him and the King left. They were crushed so close they were face to face. He could only stare at the burning holes in its skull. It was a little disconcerting—at least with eyes, you could kind of tell how close they were to being finished.\par
Zane was getting near Critical by the time those huge jaws finally slackened. And he slumped bonelessly to the ground. He couldn't seem to move very much. He kept hacking up little gobs of flesh he assumed were minor organs. He kept smiling all the while.\par
He looked up and saw the Beetle King's head droop listlessly. Stormfire pits smoldered where its eyes would've been. The insides of its head—all blazing.\par
He'd outlasted them. He'd won.\par
That was good. He liked that fight.\par
Zane was surrounded by a lot of white light. Beetle bodies burned through at last. There's a pleasant tingling feeling as they gushed into him one by one. There must have been dozens of them. A few of them had already given essence. Now the rest were pouring in. He remembered that Elixir he'd just taken. Four' minor grades' of extra talent, huh?\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 93 -> 94\par
Yep. He could definitely feel the difference. He wasn't sure how much better it was percentage-wise. Maybe a quarter better than usual? As he saw a Beetle dissolve and felt its essence come in, it felt pretty significant.\par
He was fully healed now, but a few phantom pains still lingered. That happened sometimes. The body was made whole, but the mind still echoed some of the old sensations. Well—time to—\par
Wait.\par
The Beetle King. It was only now starting to dissolve. Then a wall of essence just struck him.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 94 -> 95\par
… what.\par
He stood there, dumbfounded.\par
He couldn't remember the last time he got two Levels at once. It felt like not since he was in the 50s or something.\par
It was a pity that tingling feeling was leaving him now. Seemed the Elixir was pretty much done.\par
"That was awesome!" Evan came running over, looking all excited. Zane wasn't really one for compliments. But for some reason coming from Evan, it felt good.\par
"Thanks."\par
"That was sooooo smart," Evan gushed. "Getting them all to bite on you so you could line them up like that!"\par
“….”\par
This was the first time Zane could remember when someone thought he was smarter than he actually was. They usually took one look at him and assumed he was a dummy.\par
Zane didn't even bother correcting him. It felt nice. He nodded like yes, he'd indeed planned on getting trash compacted all along.\par
Then he sat down.\par
"One moment."\par
"What's up?"\par
"I need to solidify this new Major Law."\par
"The one you got from the Beetles?"\par
"Mhm."\par
"Oh. Okay."\par
Evan got out his Bag of Holding, rummaged through it, pulled out what looked to be a pretty well-worn copy of some comic book called Hunter x Hunter, and sat down by a tree root.\par
Zane closed his eyes.\par
About 10 minutes later, he opened them.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Major Law of Echoing Clangor\par
Now. How could he use this?\par
He tried fitting them into some attacking Skill like the Beetles had done. But Rising Storm Slash was a bad fit. So was Cyclone. He sensed he wasn't ready to fuse different Elements like that—Stormfire being the exception.\par
So he threw it into Man of Steel. He knew exactly how he'd use it. It'd make absorbing impacts much easier. Whenever something hit him the vibrations would get muffled, stifled—dispersed on the surface. They'd find no weakness in him.\par
Skill up!\par
Man of Steel I -> II\par
Now Beetle pincers would have a hard time getting past skin, even. And getting whacked by blunt forces like hammers would do a whole lot less.\par
He stood, smiling a little.\par
"Let's go."\par
Evan looked up. "Oh okay! Are you still gonna do your Law?"\par
"I did. I finished it."\par
Evan blinked. "Heh?"\par


\section{91. Types of Talent}
\par
"I finished it," Zane said. "And added it to a Skill." He stood, ready to get going.\par
Evan still looked baffled. "Heh?" He said again.\par
"What?"\par
"It's been like half an hour!”\par
Zane didn't understand. Then—oh. He could see the confusion. "No," he said. "I didn't learn the whole Major Law at once. I got the Minor Laws from the Beetle fights. I just put them together."\par
He could see why it would've been a little shocking. Thirty minutes was pretty fast to learn a Major Law from scratch.\par
But if anything Evan looked more baffled. "Heh?!"\par
"…"\par
"You learned a whole Major Law just now?”\par
Zane shrugged.\par
Evan scratched his head. He looked like he was realizing a lot of things at once.\par
"Yes?" Zane prompted.\par
"Oh!" Evan snapped out of his thoughts, looking sheepish. "It's just that I've never really been around other World Rankers. I spent most of my time up till now up in Idaho, see, around my uncle's farm. So… wow… I thought maybe I was okay, y'know? 'Cause I only talked to folks back home. But I guess compared to normal World Rankers, I'm kind of a dummy, huh. It takes me like half a day to put Minor Laws together… And I didn't even know you could add new Laws to Skills! I don't think I could do it if I tried…"\par
He wore a bashful grin. He didn't seem too cut up about it. "Well. I guess you've just gotta do the best with what you've got, right?"\par
"Sure." Zane frowned. "You come from a farm?"\par
"Yeah!" said Evan brightly. "This is my first time out of state. Everything's so big! Uncle Sammy took me to Boise a few times for repairs on the tractor, and we saw some buildings like ten stories high, but it was nothing like this stuff. I mean, I guess that could just be 'cause of the Change. I heard redwoods were pretty big. But not this big."\par
He stared up at the Tree again, and whatever little lingering sadness he felt about apparently being a dummy was washed away by wonder again.\par
Something still felt off to Zane. "You're from somewhere rural."\par
"Yup! It's just cornfields for miles."\par
"Were there strong dungeons there?"\par
Evan shook his head. "Nope, not really, just a bunch of F-ranks."\par
That sounded like Zane's starting point. Maybe even worse.\par
Just how had Evan gotten to Level 93? He didn't seem the type to go around killing people. Or solo chain-clearing dungeons like Zane did. And Evan didn't care about treasures at all.\par
He checked the boy out again.\par
Evan Armstrong\par
Essence Level 94\par
… Level 94 now.\par
Zane frowned. What had Evan even killed up till now? A few Roots, maybe a Beetle or two, some Locust Swarms? Maybe he'd been pretty close to the next Level already.\par
But that Elixir just now had Zane thinking about talent. Hmm.\par
Maybe there were different kinds of talent. He couldn't know for sure, just a hunch, but he got the feeling Evan's Leveling talent wasn't quite the same as his. And it was the other way around for soul talent, whatever that meant.\par
***\par
Now that the Beetles were gone, the path ahead was clear. A tunnel burrowing through the wood. His mini-map showed it winding up in loops, popping out on the far side of the trunk.\par
The walls were faintly shiny yet hard, like sap crusted over the Titansteel bark. There wasn't any light but Evan brought out his sword. It acted like a big glow stick. They went in.\par
They found the tunnel was quite uneven. It had thousands of little divots, like the whole thing was made by a swarm of giant bugs chewing through the bark. You could see the places where their teeth sank in. That sap might be dried insect saliva, now Zane thought of it.\par
Soon a buzzing started to echo down the tunnel. Not a Beetle buzzing—higher pitched and broader, like it was coming from a bunch of places at once. The farther they got into the tunnel, the louder the buzzing. Red dots popped up on the mini-map. They were up around a bend, swooping in fast. Coming right at them.\par
Zane saw them maybe thirty or forty feet off, blotting out the way ahead.\par
A swarm of hundreds. Wasps the size of birds. Their stingers looked gnarly, like the spikes on vines, tipped a lurid poison-purple. Their fat bodies were brown streaked green, and their wings were almost translucent. They glowed a sickly green.\par
They seemed angry.\par
Wood Wasps Swarm (Monster)\par
Essence Level 91Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.\par
Yeah, Zane wasn't doing this.\par
"Evan," he grunted.\par
"On it!"\par
The boy leaped through and started slashing. It felt like watching helicopter blades—so fast you couldn't even see the parts, just a sense of incredible movement. "Sunblade Arc!" Evan cried. Out loud, for some reason.\par
The tunnel came alive with light. Evan must've fired off two dozen shots in the span of a second. Just dizzying dexterity. Light and lightning raced down the tunnel, lighting up wasps, ping-ponging between the Wasps. It wasn't enough—there was quite a lot of them. A few looked like they were going to make it through.\par
But something odd happened. The closer they got, the fiercer Evan got too. They zipped up until they were within striking range. It was like they hit a wall.\par
Evan held them there, downing them in light. His slashes just kept getting faster and faster.\par
It was this way with the Beetle, too. Zane got the feeling the stronger the challenge, the stronger Evan got. It wasn't even a mental thing. His powers seemed to literally grow. Zane wondered if it was that 'Power of Determination' Skill, or 'the Power of Friendship.' Maybe both?\par
At the end of it, the Wasps were all dust. And there stood Evan, panting. He seemed to be a burst fighter—he didn't seem to have a great deal of stamina. Though Zane got the feeling if he was defending a friend, he could last quite a while.\par
"Good job," Zane said. He ruffled the boy's hair. Evan beamed up at him. Zane felt warmth gushing out of him—he was already looking at Zane as though at a big brother. "Aww geez…” said Evan, flushing.\par
Zane usually felt a little uncomfortable about this kind of thing. But for some reason, he just liked the boy. Just this once he was fine with it.\par
"Why did you shout your Skill?"\par
Evan blinked. He looked confused. “I dunno…I guess it just felt right?”\par
They made it up the rest of the winding slope. Not long after, a circle of bright blue light opened up to them. The exit. Zane passed on through and took everything in.\par
He stood on a bark ledge—one of those ridges he'd seen from way down at the bottom. From up here, the whole world opened up to him.\par
Far east, you could see the white-streaked mountains. They looked a little unreal from this high; little white triangles cut out on a bright-blue sky. Look west and he could barely make out the Pacific Ocean. A glimmering suggestion of deep-blue, stretching horizon to horizon…\par
He turned his gaze closer. Branches stuck out like girders, carrying vast platforms of steely glinting leaves. They puffed up all around him. He saw a few down below but most were up ahead, spiraling up and up and up, all the way through the clouds…\par
There was one a few dozen feet down. And on them, he saw these fat, shiny-gray chickling thingies. They were fat and round, kind of fluffy-looking, with tiny steel wings and massive yellow beaks. Wrecking balls of steely feathers.\par
Steelwing Eaglet (Monster)\par
Level 90\par
A few glared up at him. But they were hopping around. They didn't seem to be able to fly. Fake birds then. Good.\par
He spotted a few yellow dots blanketing the platform too—they seemed to be hanging off the boughs.\par
Vital Bark Pinecone (B)\par
A pinecone carrying the distilled plant essences of the great Titansteel Tree. Highly rich in Wood Laws, this treasure is a rare comprehension aid.\par
Reina—at his encouragement—had started setting aside a little time to do some Law work. She was drawn to Laws having to do with life. Earth Laws, Wood Laws… they seemed to match her Signature Title. He figured he could collect a few of these for her.\par
There was another treasure which he couldn't quite make out on the bough below. He squinted up at a bough above—he could barely see it out around the curve of the tree. A giant leaf, shinier than the rest, smoking with Steel Laws...\par
Titansteel Leaf (B)\par
A leaf forged of the Elemental Law of Steel, this treasure aids greatly in Steel Law comprehension. The signature treasure of the Titansteel Tree.\par
He'd need to get himself some of those too. He could see quite a few sticking on the upper boughs.\par
The wind was pretty heavy up here. It howled past him, tugging at his hair and his arms. The path up was jagged. There was no safety rail or anything. You had to climb a wood ridge barely wide enough to hold his foot. It'd be like walking a tightrope.\par
There could be no falling off. He thought about using his Axes, sinking them in, and climbing up Axe by Axe. But once you got out from the ridge the winds got a lot fiercer. The Wind Laws up there looked to be trouble. And if he got attacked, he was less sure of himself dangling than if he was on two feet. There was also Evan to think of.\par
Probably better just to climb the normal way.\par
Speaking of Evan. He took a step, then frowned. The boy wasn't behind him. Zane felt a glut of simmering fear back in the tunnel; he backtracked and found Evan hyperventilating, staring out into the bright blue abyss. He was going "ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh" over and over. "C'mon...You can do it," he whispered to himself. "C'mon!"\par
"Evan," said Zane. The boy jerked up; wide eyes met his own. "Take my hand."\par
And he held it out. The boy hesitated; his eyes trembled a little. He was swamped with fear.\par
"Look at me," said Zane. "There are birds out there. I need you. Do you understand?"\par
He was about to say 'I won't let you fall,' but he didn't need to.\par
The moment the words 'I need you' left Zane's mouth, Evan stilled.\par
His eyes went wide. His breath caught.\par
Then he bit his lip. His whole face went flush. And fierce determination swelled in him, rising above the fear—and in seconds his whole demeanor changed. Huh.\par
Evan nodded. "Okay!"\par
He took Zane's hand, still trembling. But he was full of new bravery. He didn’t look at the sky anymore. He just looked at Zane.\par
Together they stepped out onto the ridge.\par
Then slowly, surely, they started climbing. At first Evan's fear spiked again. But when they’d taken ten steps, then twenty, it slowly started to ebb. Zane was satisfied. He'd be fine.\par
They were making a slow spiral around the trunk, shimmying their way along. There was a platform of branches coming up a quarter turn away. But before then, they hit on a treasure.\par
It was like Quicksilver pouring down in a thick, gooey stream right in front of them.\par
Titansteel Sap (B)\par
The sap of the Titansteel Tree contains a fraction of its life force. Immensely rich in essence.\par
"Here!" stammered Evan, thrusting some empty vials at him.\par
Zane blinked. "Why do you have empty vials?"\par
"Was a B-boy Scout," Evan said proudly. "Always p-prepared."\par
Zane scooped in three full Vials before the Sap dried up. They kept moving.\par
The first bough loomed up ahead of them, drowning them in its shadow. But between here and there, there was a red dot.\par
A chunk of the trunk detached itself. It looked like a man made of bark. And it blocked the path ahead.\par
It kind of looked like Groot from that one movie but shinier. A humanoid wood monster. Like an ent. It put up its hammers for arms, like a boxer.\par

Oh, interesting. This thing had Spirit Steel Body.\par
Zane's Axe was too unwieldy and too heavy besides. So were his Chains. He'd go plummeting over the side if he used them here.\par
He didn't mind doing this the old-fashioned way. He put up his fists and grinned.\par
Time to fistfight on a tightrope.\par


\section{92. Dungeon Dojo (I)}
\par
He took a step closer. The Bark Sentinel took a step back. It eyed him just as he eyed it. He could tell just by how it moved—its little hops, the subtle ways it shifted its weight on its planks for feet—it knew what it was doing.\par
Zane threw a punch just to see.\par
He missed and ate a battering-ram arm to the face for his trouble. He heard a little gasp from behind.\par
Zane had two thoughts then.\par
First, Ow.\par
And then—oh, interesting.\par
It was a THUD now. Not a CLANG anymore. A day ago it might've really hurt. But with Echoing Clangor woven in, his thick head was now extra thick. The force went into his face. He felt the blast of it. But the shock rippled out skin deep. His face smarted, but that was it.\par
The Bark Sentinel watched him silently with beady black eyes. Waiting for him to rush in again.\par
He did and it hit him again. He got the same feeling. The force rippled off him. His skin split a little, but the important bits—the muscle, the bone—felt fine.\par
The next time he stepped in, he lobbed a hook at it.\par
It slipped out the way. And this time its hammer like arm steamed bright gray essence, gushing Steel Law.\par
When it hit him his head snapped all the way back; he stumbled. He heard Evan give a little gasp.\par
"I'm fine," he said, licking blood off a split lip. And he was. He could take a lot more than that. He was much more curious than hurt.\par
That blow was much, much heavier than the others… how'd it do that?\par
He lunged at it again, hoping it'd do it again. And sure enough it leaped back, loaded the same Skill, and blasted him. His head whipped to the left. Ah.\par
It was the same Law the Beetle had in its shell. Steely Density.\par
Well this changed things.\par
With Echoing Clangor, his body already got a strong upgrade. But he could always use more. And he still had a Major Law or so to go before he tapped out his comprehension...\par
He felt the Law most clearly when the thing hit him. Hmm.\par
This time Zane didn't even bother punching; he led with his head. He walked straight into three full-force blasts. THUD-THUD-THUD!\par
Pain exploded on his face. He stumbled back a step. He tasted blood and grinned. Yes—he was really feeling it now. He made sure to pay close attention to the sensation of that hunk of steel as it smashed his face in. There was very little rebound or recoil—just this huge hefty mass… there was something there, something fascinating. He paid close attention. Zane came in again, got whacked again. His head snapped back. The sensation grew clearer.\par
The few times he'd tried this, like with the Beetles, it proved pretty darn effective. He decided to call it 'learning by experience.'\par
Then the Monster growled and started wailing on him. It seemed to think he was making fun of it. Uppercut, hook, jab, cross, THUD-THUD-THUD. It was like one of those master boxers teeing off on a punching bag. It sounded like machine gun fire. His head went twelve different ways in the span of a second.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%!\par
He was smiling wide now, baring bloody teeth. He wasn't really even there. He was floating over the scene, seeing the punches like bursts of color on his face, inspecting them curiously. He felt the fist digging into his cheek, snapping his head to the side, and took a moment to appreciate just how tightly packed every little bit of it was.\par
There was quite a lot of force going into it, courtesy of his face. But it wasn't dampening it like Echoing Clangor. It just straight-up absorbed it. Cool stuff.\par
Both Echoing Clangor and Steely Density destroyed force. Just in different ways. But ways that could work together. If he brought this into his body too, he felt his durability could reach a whole new level.\par
By now he couldn't see very well. One eye was swollen totally shut. The other was most of the way there. His face was probably bruised pretty bad, just a mess of purple all over.\par
"C'mon, Zane!" He heard Evan crying. "Fight back! I believe in you!"\par
He felt Evan getting increasingly worried behind him, so he threw up a thumbs-up sign to show he was okay. Unfortunately it came just as a haymaker landed so hard he nearly fell off the side of the Tree. He had to frantically grab hold of the trunk to steady himself.\par
He realized this probably didn't inspire confidence. On the surface it just looked like he was getting the shit beaten out of him. Which he was. But it was for a good cause. He tried to explain it out loud. And nearly bit his tongue when an uppercut smooshed against his chin.The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.\par
Then it hit him. The revelation, that was.\par
Though at first he wasn't sure if he was having a eureka-moment or if he'd just been hit really hard.\par
To his relief—\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Indomitable Compactness (Elemental Law of Steel) \par
Then he heard a crack. And the punching stopped.\par
He frowned, then winced; moving all those muscles at once made his bruised face flare with pain.\par
What…?\par
He reached out to the Bark Sentinel and felt the reason. It was in a good deal of pain, just like him.\par
Its fist broke.\par
On Zane's face.\par
Zane was speechless.\par
How was that even possible? Wasn't it meant to be durable? Then he remembered his face was probably a lot harder than its fist. And it'd been wailing on him full force for a while now…\par
"Pathetic," Zane sighed.\par
He lit his fist with Stormfire and charged at it. Seriously this time. It got him pretty good as he came in—it must've whacked him four or five times clean. The problem was, it didn't really matter how skilled it was. It could've hit him twenty times. Zane just needed to land once.\par
And when he did it was over instantly.\par
The wood shattered; his fist broke through. And its head was a burning pyre. It stumbled around, flailing for balance. Zane ripped it twice to the belly, opening up new craters. After that the whole thing caught on fire. Then he just lifted a foot and punted it. It shot off the side of the Tree like an asteroid; and like an asteroid hitting the atmosphere, it burned up, broke apart, smoked to nothing on the way down.\par
It was just yet another confirmation of a theory he'd been nurturing for a while now.\par
It didn't really matter how smart or skilled the enemy was. If Zane just got big enough, he could overcome anything.\par
And now he was about a third of the way to becoming even bigger. He could sense what he needed. Two Minor Laws to go.\par
He licked his lip—it was whole now.\par
Skill up!\par
Fiery Renewal I -> II\par
He blinked. Well that was a pleasant surprise. Maybe he should get beat up more often.\par
***\par
Fiery Renewal was patching up the worst of the damage. For a while there he was pretty much blind, but now the swelling was dying down he could kind of see out of his left eye.\par
He came back and found Evan in a bit of a daze.\par
"Were—were you trying to learn another Minor Law just now?" said the boy, eyes wide.\par
"Not trying to. I did." Zane was pretty pleased about it, too.\par
"That fast?!" Evan looked so confused. "Is this how World Rankers normally train?" Suddenly he was full of doubt. "Maybe I've just been doing it wrong this whole time," he mumbled. "Maybe that's why I'm so slow…"\par
He seemed to be having a bit of an existential crisis. He started frowning at the Titansteel like he was wondering if he should start bashing his head on it.\par
Zane patted him before he got any ideas. "No," he said reassuringly. "Don't worry. I do dumb things. Don't copy me."\par
“…oh…” Evan still seemed confused.\par
"You're not slow," Zane said. He scratched his head. "I think… I'm fast."\par
"…oh!"\par
They moved on.\par
***\par
Zane was realizing that as long as you lacked enough common sense, a dungeon could be a very big dojo. This whole Tree could be his personal Steel Law treasure area. He'd once had an elementary school teacher who liked to say 'everything is a learning opportunity'. He'd thought it was silly then, but it turned out she was right.\par
Though… he had a feeling this attitude might get him in trouble eventually. Looking up, he could see the underside of the first bough coming up fast. He saw bulging shadows drifting over the leaves… Hmm.\par
Those bird-things…he had a feeling they had some good Steel Laws on them. But they were birds.\par
He looked at Evan, pluckily coming up behind him. He had some insurance.\par
"I'm going going to do some dangerous things," said Zane. "Maybe things that will put me at pretty low Health. Like with that wood Monster back there. If it gets too bad, I'll need your help. Are you ready?"\par
He doubted he'd need it. He planned to turn things around before they got too bad. But if he did, he got the feeling Evan would be pretty good at that kind of thing.\par
Poor Evan had been in a state of confusion all morning. "Can you maybe not do dangerous things?" Evan said hopefully.\par
Zane stopped cold and thought about it. The idea really didn't agree with him for some reason. Since Evan seemed to look up to him, he decided to impart some advice. "If you don't do dangerous things, how do you know you're alive?"\par
"Oh!" Evan bit his lip. "I guess that makes sense…"\par
They kept walking. He felt a growing bundle of confusion behind him. After a while he heard Evan mumble, "Wait…that doesn't make sense at all…"\par
Zane tried to put it simply, in a way the boy would understand.\par
"If I need you to save me, can I count on you?"\par
It was like he'd said the magic words. Evan nodded vigorously. "Yes! You can count on me!"\par
Zane smiled. "Good."\par
***\par
He'd probably find plenty more of those Bark Sentinels on the way up. For now, though, the first giant bough was coming up quick.\par
The ridge opened up into a branch. It was thick and sturdy, like a little road leading up. They made it up and saw the Monsters waiting for them, strutting around the glinting field of silver leaves. There were a dozen or so spread out there.\par
Steelwing Eaglet (Monster)\par
Essence Level 93\par
Laws:\par
Major Law of Steely Density (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
Major Law of Undying Might (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
Major Law of Tempest’s Fury (Elemental Law of Wind)\par
Major Law of Absolute Sharpness\par

Beak Hammer Strike (Active) [Rare]: The wielder uses its beak like a hammer. It delivers powerful, crushing blows capable of cracking magical and physical defenses, causing significant damage.\par
Cannonball Roll (Active) [Epic]: The wielder tucks in their limbs and roll at high speeds towards its target, making its body a devastating projectile.\par
Steelfeather Guard (Passive) [Uncommon]: The wielder's steel-like feathers provide a natural armor, offering great resistance to physical attacks.\par
Zane was eyeing them, looking for one specific Law… Steely Density. Perfect.\par
"Stay back," he told Evan.\par
Evan looked at him, worried. "Are you gonna do a dangerous thing now?"\par
"Yes."\par
"Oh." A pause. "Okay!" He gave Zane a thumbs up. He was still nervous, but he smiled, trying to be encouraging. "You’ve got this!" he called.\par
"Thanks."\par
First, he got out all his C-Grade Law Fruits. And ate them one by one. A pleasant tingling filled his head.\par
The leaves were thick and stable enough to walk on. And as Zane took his first steps, those giant Wrecking-Ball birds started chirping and stamping their talons.\par
Then he took a deep breath, summoned his Axes, and dropped them like anchors. Deep into the boughs.\par
And as one, they charged him.\par
When he looked at them, he wasn't really even seeing Monsters. He was seeing two new Minor Laws barreling toward him. It sparked joy in him.\par


\section{93. Dungeon Dojo (II)}
\par
Zane was feeling quite pleased with this strategy.\par
Then the first Eaglet hit him like a speeding truck. CLANG-THUMP! And he went flying.\par
It blasted the wind out of him. It felt like it blasted everything out of him. He crumpled in, hacking and coughing. His whole front side stung head-to-toe.\par
Then his Chains caught him, yanked him back down. And the real beating began.\par
An Eaglet struck him from behind. He went flying—right into another wrecking-ball bird. They started playing pinball with his body, whomping him all over the place.\par
"Hang in there!" cried Evan.\par
They tossed him like a rag doll, blasting him every which way—CLANG-THUMP! CLANG-THUMP! He had to focus. He had to find his peace. He closed his eyes even as he felt his body twisting, crumpling oddly. He tried to let all that stinging pain go—just feelings, rising and falling…\par
It was pretty darn hard, even for him. They kept snapping his head back and forth, breaking up his thoughts. It was a little nauseating flipping all over the place. And the sounds—the CLANG-CLANG-CLANGING, the furious screeching, the steel-on-steel raking of those massive talons as they skidded around, the gale winds howling in the background—it was a lot.\par
You had to have a certain mix of innate calmness, comprehension, and sheer stupidity to try a Law trance while getting the shit beaten out of you. But he knew he had all three of those things. He just had to put them together….\par
He was getting there. Yes. His body might be flailing all over the place, but his mind was slowly growing still. He could feel himself floating away little by little….\par
The pain and the sounds were soon like colors in his field of view. Just feelings drifting in the void. And he saw what lay beneath—the Laws weaving it all together.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%\par
It hurt a little more every time the Eaglets hit him. He was bruising pretty badly. The blunt force was seeping through. Echoing Clangor could only do so much.\par
But he looked past all that. He felt the way Steely Density wove through those feathery forms. He felt it especially sharply as they rammed him. The Law changed the structure of their bodies at the tiniest of levels. It was so clear to him now… the patterns of the steel, the way it all held together, drawn taught with essence…\par
They struck him over. And over. And over. Until—\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Unbreakable Bonds (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
He grinned. Something blasted him in the face and he lost a front tooth. He kept grinning. One down.\par
His thinking shifted. He focused now on the sheer weight of it—\par
He had to take a moment to choke out a few mouthfuls of blood.\par
They were really hitting him hard, weren't they? He seemed to be breaking up a little. Even with all his dampening, he felt the trauma deep inside—jolts of sharp pain lighting up his chest, his belly, every time they hit him.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 50\%\par
Savage Body activated!\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Speed increased 25\%\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
Just one more! The notification gave him a jolt of fresh energy. He was getting more excited, getting into it.\par
Then a bowling ball of a bird struck Zane head-on. It felt like being struck by lightning. They were so close—and he was so high on his feelings, on Law Fruit—in that violent split-second their minds were one. He could feel all its monstrous fury. He could feel its Skill, its Law. He felt the way denseness gave way to mass—the way the Universe gave heaviness to Steel…they pulled apart but the impression shone clear in his mind.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Steely Gravitas (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
He had all he needed.\par
It felt like waking from a deep sleep. Usually you'd feel refreshed from that kind of thing. But as he came back all his sensations started feeling real again, close again. Everything hurt.\par
Burning spheres of pain up his belly, his chest, down his spine, flaring up his face… He seemed to be cartwheeling midair. Then a huge force blasted him up the side, sent him bouncing down the bough like a pebble on the surface of a lake. Straight into another brutal roll.Unauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.\par
He spat out another mouthful of blood. He frowned at his arm. It was broken in at least two places. And he wasn't a doctor, but he'd ruptured organs enough times he could tell when he had a few sloshing around in there. There were some telltale signs—when he tried twisting his torso, it felt like hot pokers were stabbing his insides.\par
Plus Evan was standing on the sidelines over there, hopping foot to foot, and Zane could feel how stressed out the boy was… he felt kind of bad about it. Time to end things.\par
Zane yanked his Axes out. And sent them spinning all around him, carving into those spinning balls of steel and flesh.\par
Rising Storm Slash!\par
It was like slicing a fruit in half. The blade went straight through the nearest ball—tore past the feathers like they weren't there, ripped through the middle, came out the other side stained red tip-to-hilt.\par
And with a shocked squawk, the fat bird exploded.\par
Zane grinned as his other axe popped a bird on the other side. They were shaped like balloons and they popped like balloons—popped to big flaming sizzling fireballs. His Axes lurched around in a wild loop. The Monsters were silly enough to bowl at him full speed. He shredded them one by one. POP-POP-POP!\par
Then something hit him from behind so hard he face-planted into the bough. An angry bird face loomed over him, blotting out the sun. Its beak was like one of those plague doctors' masks. It started stabbing pecks at him. It opened a deep gash down his belly.\par
His falling Axe caved its head in. The blast of Stormfire was so intense he couldn't even see the rest of its face anymore—just the beak. Whatever held it up must've melted. The thing came sloshing off, clattered to a stop on the bright steel leaves.\par
He felt another soul coming to get a piece of him and lurched out of the way. He slashed as he did. A bird popped not two feet from him. The heat of the blast had his hair streaming; he felt wisps of Stormfire tingling on his skin. This time he shielded his face so only his arm got bloody. He spat out a clump of hard feathers.\par
Then he looked around, panting, surveying all the little fires burning around him, burning out. That... seemed to be the last of them? And a good thing too. He was getting pretty low on Health, and had just one arm and leg left to work with.\par
He was pretty happy about how things ended up. He'd pulled through and gotten exactly what he wanted. Now to condense Steely Density and add it to his body. He felt eager just thinking about it.\par
A shadow loomed over him. Not just him. It blocked out a full third of the bough. He looked up.\par
That thing kind of looked like one of those giant stealth bomber jets. With feathers like giant knives, long as his body, glinting cruelly in the bright sun. Its eyes were stark yellow with pitch-black pupils. Its beak was one great sleek hook, ending at a glimmering point. Its legs were coated in burnished iron scales, ending at claws big enough to crush small vehicles.\par
It blotted out the sun, but it felt to Zane like a second sun—a sun of pure feeling. It gave off rage like the sun gave off light.\par
Huh.\par
Steelwing Eagle (Monster)\par
Essence Level 97\par
Laws:\par
Major Law of Steely Density (Elemental Law of Steel)\par

Ruler of the Skies (Passive) [Epic]\par
Grants the wielder supernatural aerial dexterity, speed, and reflexes while airborne.\par
It screeched and Zane's ears blew out. For a second all he heard was a high-pitched whine.\par
Level 97.\par
That… looked like it could be a serious problem. Not just its Level. That was a lot of Laws…\par
Why was there an exclamation point on 'Blade Wing Maelstrom'? Something popped up.\par
A single ! denotes High-Level Skill. High-Level Skills are Skills that are Level V or above.\par
Uh. Inferno Cyclone had been a Level V Epic skill. If this was anything like that…\par
And with how his Health was right now…\par
Oh boy.\par
Then the Eagle's wings flared wide, and it unleashed hell on him.\par
He tried to get out of the way, but his leg—his whole body really—was far too broken. He couldn't move fast enough. He could only watch as sleek lines of shining steel rained down on him.\par
The sound they made was so subtle—just a sh-sh-sh. Probably because they cut so clean. He didn't realize he'd been cut until he was staring at a footlong wound so deep he could see bone. Then another hit him, and another—he tried throwing up his Chains, tried blocking them out, but it was like there was more steel than air.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 25\%\par
It pissed him off, honestly. What a bird thing to do. Wait until he was all worn out, then hit him with its strongest shot—while it was still fresh too.\par
He kept wrapping himself, kept trying to block, but his ribs were getting sliced open, his thighs, his arms, just everywhere; he was being dissected feather by feather. His head felt woozy. This was bad. It really wanted to kill him. It was giving him everything—huge streams of essence were pouring out of it, slicing into him…\par
He was dropping dangerously close to Critical.\par
New plan. Time to bail.\par
He had to get the hell out but that hail of feathers kept pinning him down. He readied a Volt Step—\par
Then all the pain was gone. In its place he felt a soft gold light. His body surged with new energy—not his own. He felt warm all over. For a second he thought he'd gone to heaven or something—then he saw it was just Fiery Renewal, burning brighter than it ever had. Burning up new flesh, patching up his wounds… what?\par
Something was helping. Some kind of… soul connection? He looked up.\par
The steel rain was still falling.\par
But Evan was there too, standing over him, sword flashing at a blinding pace. And he struck every feather out of the sky. He was blazing with essence and determination and anger. Zane didn't even know he could get angry. His body was literally shining, spilling gold rays everywhere.\par
"I won't let you hurt my friend!" he cried.\par
The gold flared brilliantly—and it started shoving back the hail of silver.\par
Zane felt the Eagle's disbelief. It poured on even more. But Evan kept slashing faster, slashing harder—the Eagle let out a silver tornado, but somehow Evan kept digging deeper.\par
The Eagle wasn't letting up—by now the air was a silver wall. It was willing to go down to its last drop of essence. Its powers reached a fever pitch… and so did Evan's.\par
It was almost like it didn't matter what the Eagle threw. Somehow, impossibly, Evan would find a way to match it. And then some.\par


\section{94. Dungeon Dojo (III)}
\par
Silver rained down. Gold poured up. They met in a single line of pure light.\par
For a second they held there. Soundless, shining.\par
Then the line started to move up. And up. And up.\par
The gold was only gaining; the silver stuttered. The Eagle felt baffled. Evan felt angry.\par
The Eagle was forced to break it off. It twisted midair, twirled, and winked out at lightning speed. There was a schism of air in its absence—then the gold swept by, hitting nothing. The Eagle was circling the far side, trying for another shot.\par
"Sunblade arc!" Evan cried.\par
In Zane's eyes Evan felt everything intensely. Only now did Zane realize that was just normal for him. This was Evan when he was truly intense—determination and anger gushed out of him like great rivers. His feelings burned so hot he was shaking with them.\par
Then a huge power welled up in him. It crossed the air in a blink. The Eagle was fast, so fast when it moved you could barely make it out with the naked eye. This slash was fast, so fast it seemed to have no distance at all—the way bullets seem to have no distance. It was here, then it was there. This massive arc of gold biting into the Eagle's slick feathered wing, drawing a shower of blood.\par
Suddenly the Eagle was spinning out of control. It shrieked, flapping desperately, trying to right itself, even as one of its wings hung on by strips of flesh and gristle.\par
Then he saw Evan hunch over, starting to gather his powers for one final blow.\par
Zane had healed past Critical by now. He was ready to help. He would've done something, but looking at Evan he decided to hold back. Something told him the boy was handling it just fine.\par
Evan shook, wobbling a little, like he was struggling to hold up something far, far bigger than himself. His sword shone so bright it felt like looking at the sun with a naked eye. The power was breathtaking. Where was Evan getting it all?\par
Zane probed a little, and he felt it. Evan got it from his feelings—feelings about Zane, strangely enough. He was really mad the Eagle had tried to kill Zane.\par
With a cry, he let it loose. The slash tore across the world so fast it was like everything else stood still. The Eagle tried getting out of the way—its wing was at the top of a flap. It hadn't got halfway through by the time Evan's slash struck it.\par
A gold line ripped across the steel wing Eagle's torso. And half of it fell one way, the other half the other. In between, there was only blood.\par
He just tore that Boss in two. With one blow. … Huh.\par
It took everything out of him. Suddenly Evan's soul flickered like a candle in harsh winds, barely there. He felt like he was about to go out any second. But something in him held on.\par
He turned and wobbled over to Zane, his trembling bright blue eyes wide. "Are—are you okay?" He slurred.\par
"Yeah," said Zane. "I'm fine."\par
"Oh!" Evan said. Relief washed over him.\par
He went out like a light. Zane caught him before he hit the ground.\par
…Had he been holding on just to make sure Zane was fine?\par
He had no essence left—literally zero. He gave everything he had and then some.\par
Zane thought back to his Skills, frowning. There could only be one explanation. This had to be that 'Power of Determination' Skill.\par
He imagined how confusing it'd be being on the other side of it. It was as though there was no end to his power. Really, it depended on Evan's determination. And this baby-faced boy, sleeping peacefully, seemed to have an endless well of it.\par
Strange thing, too, Zane's Fiery Renewal was slower now. Only now did he realize it was that 'Power of Friendship' Skill boosting him earlier, making it work better.\par
Well. Zane scooped Evan up and started backtracking a little—just to the tunnel mouth they'd come out of. Safely inside, he put Evan in his own sleeping bag, fed him a little Essence Elixir, and patted him on the head. He did good.\par
Every passing hour, it seemed, Zane was more and more glad he let Evan come along. With how fast that bird was going, it would've been a real hassle.\par
…Also, he kind of just liked Evan. There were very few people Zane would choose to be around over being alone. Somehow Evan was now one of them.\par
***\par
While Evan slept, this was a good chance to get the rest of Zane's Law work done; he was feeling a little tired. His Law Fruit was wearing off. He was close to his limit—two Major Laws a day, and he could feel it. A dense fog was settling in his mind. He had to push. Just a little more before he ran out.\par
He sat down and fell easily into his Law trance.\par
Indomitable compactness. Gravitational dominion. Unbreakable bonds. They swirled around in his mind, weaving together…If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
Soon—\par
Law comprehended!\par
Major Law of Steely Density\par
Yes.\par
He wondered how close he was to the full Elemental Law now. At least one or two Major Laws off, he felt like. He knew for certain one. That big bird had had 'Magnetic Command.'\par
Something fizzled in his head and he yawned mightily. He was crashing a little. Shit.\par
Before he did, he had one more thing to squeeze in.\par
He thought of his Man of Steel Skill. And how steely density could weave right into it—slotting right next to his other Major Laws. It came pretty easily.\par
Skill up!\par
Man of Steel II -> III\par
Before, he could make his body as dense as Spirit Steel. But now when he raised his density he felt his whole body tighten far beyond what was naturally possible. He pushed his body to the very limit. Then it took some effort to keep his limbs up, to keep his spine upright. His feet started sinking into the Titansteel bark. Everything took on an enormous weight. Even his eyelids felt weirdly heavy.\par
He flexed his fingers, blinking curiously at them. How much did each weigh? Fifty pounds? A hundred? This was pushing beyond his physical limits—this was a new state. It took some serious essence to hold his body here. He couldn't stay here forever. He didn't want to anyway. It'd be pretty inconvenient. But in battle… yes. This could really come in handy. He smiled.\par
He'd put nearly a full Elemental Law in Man of Steel now. He was probably close to peak Steel durability—at least with this Skill.\par
He was itching to test it. But Evan was still sleeping and Zane wasn't about to leave him here, even if he was pretty sure the boy would be safe. He wouldn't wake Evan either. The boy deserved a good long rest.\par
Maybe 'boy' was selling him a bit short. He was homeschooled, but he'd said he planned on going off to college out-of-state next fall—until the Change struck, that was. So he was probably eighteen or nineteen. There was just this… Zane didn't know. Grown-ups just weren't this kind, in Zane's experience. Something about time passing twisted people, but it didn't—or couldn't—twist Evan.\par
Hours later, Evan yawned and got up, rubbing blearily at his eyes. He blinked around, then saw Zane sitting there. He beamed.\par
"You're okay!"\par
"Yes," said Zane, ruffling his hair. "You did good. You sure showed that bird."\par
Evan blushed. He was so happy his eyes were shining. If he had a tail it'd be wagging right about now. And when Zane inspected him, he was Level 95 now. Go figure.\par
Zane would have thought he'd need a little more time to recover, but Evan was ready to go again almost immediately. He was excited even. He was like a spring—you put him down, and he was bouncing right back up again.\par
It was hard to imagine it was possible for him to get angry. Angry enough to two-shot a Level 97 Boss. Looking at him now, you'd swear he'd never hurt a fly.\par
Oh. And that little 'Power of Friendship' boost was back. Subtle, but now that Zane knew what to look for he could feel it—this little soul bond connecting them. It only seemed to be growing stronger over time.\par
***\par
They took to the winding ridge path again. They picked up some treasures hanging off the bough—\par
Vital Bark Pinecone (B)\par
A pinecone carrying the distilled plant essences of the great Titansteel Tree. Highly rich in Wood Laws, this treasure is a rare comprehension aid.\par
Titansteel Leaf (B)\par
A leaf forged of the Elemental Law of Steel, this treasure aids greatly in Steel Law comprehension. The signature treasure of the Titansteel Tree.\par
Two Pinecones and three Leaves in total.\par
Then they went back to the ridge and kept climbing.\par
A couple of hundred feet higher, and they hit on their next enemy. A Bark Sentinel. Zane came at it with Steely Density cranked up. He let it hit him. Its fist clanked off his face. He barely budged. He barely even felt that. The thing threw up a shot with that one Density-punch Skill. It felt like getting hit with a flyswatter or something. You could hit him with a thousand of these things now, and they'd do almost nothing.\par
Zane took a swing at it and missed. He took another swing, missed again. Then he was done playing.\par
He just marched at it. It came out at him doing boxer nonsense, jabbing and weaving all slick. Zane flailed at it like a gorilla. It must have hit him nine times before one of his wild grabs got hold of it.\par
Then Zane pulled it closer and grabbed its throat with one hand. He held it up firm as it flailed at him.\par
He turned to see a wide-eyed Evan. He figured this was another chance to sprinkle in some sage advice.\par
"You have heard in martial arts movies and fairy tales about underdog stories. The little man can beat the big man if they are skilled." Zane frowned.\par
"Sometimes this is true," he grudgingly admitted. "But sometimes, the big man is so much bigger they can do anything and still win. Like I just did."\par
He pointed at the flailing monster he was in the middle of bullying. "Don't be like this guy. Skill is overrated. Become too big to fail."\par
It was part of his growing 'Brute Force is Always Best' philosophy. He was still hammering out the finer details. He figured Evan could be his first disciple.\par
Evan nodded; he was listening with rapt attention. "Un!" He got out a notebook and started jotting it down.\par
Then, to punctuate his point, Zane tossed the Sentinel off the side of the tree and hit it with a Rising Storm Slash. It broke up and burned out in seconds. They kept on climbing.\par
After a little while, he felt a little tug on the back of his shirt. There was Evan, looking puzzled.\par
"Zane? Um. What if I like underdogs?"\par
Zane frowned. "You do?"\par
"Yeah," he said sheepishly. "I mean. I'm not big like you… and I don't know if I could just grab Monsters like that… I'm not very strong…"\par
"You can become strong."\par
"I guess so…" Evan chewed on the thought.\par
Zane scratched his head and thought about it too. He looked at himself and then at Evan.\par
Evan was a full head shorter than him… and about half as wide... hmm.\par
He tried to imagine Evan fighting like he did. He frowned. It just felt wrong.\par
Zane was coming to a startling realization.\par
Maybe he should amend his philosophy to 'Brute Force is Always Best for Zane Walker.' He wasn't sure it was a general-purpose thing.\par
He was trying to play the part of a wise older brother. But this was a problem because he was realizing he wasn't particularly wise. Now that he thought about it, his advice was kind of just… him saying stuff that worked for him. But most of the things that worked for him also tended not to work for everyone else.\par
He scratched his head. Yeah. He figured from now on, more head pats, less advice.\par
"Forget what I said," he amended. "You keep doing what you're doing. You're doing great."\par
Evan beamed. For the rest of the climb, he was just a puddle of warm feelings.\par
** *\par
Soon the ridge ended, and they were back up a winding tunnel. This one seemed to go on for quite a while. They mostly met bug swarms inside, which Evan dispatched easily. Yeah—being fast worked well for him. Zane approved. They found a few Titansteel Sap deposits here and there which they collected. They drank them as they went. When they ran out, Zane got out other B-grade essence treasures for them to munch on on the way. Evan tried to say he didn't need it, but Zane made him take it. Zane ended up a little over four-fifths of the way to Level 96. Evan hit it.\par
It was probably lucky for—well, for the world—that Evan was exactly who he was. If he was half as ruthless as everyone else out here…\par
Anyway. They were coming up on a chamber. A chamber with a big red dot in it.\par


\section{95. Final Boss (I) }
\par
The chamber was made of pure Titansteel. Gray-brown streaks arched wall-to-ceiling. The floor was a cross-section of the Tree itself—you could see dozens of huge rings spread across it, silver lines circling one after another. Deep finger-width fissures spanned its length.\par
The air was musty. It smelled of old wood. Strips of glowing vines sprawled over the ceiling like stadium lights.\par
At the center stood the Monster. If the Bark Sentinels were lightweights, this thing was a heavyweight. It towered nine feet tall. Its face—if you could call it that—was a smattering of coarse bark ridges. Its mouth was a stark line. It had no eyes. Little mosses fuzzed its lanky limbs. Its arms looked like spiked clubs.\par
Bark Sentinel Overlord (Monster)\par
Essence Level 97\par
Law:\par
Major Law of Resilient Vitality (Elemental Law of Wood)\par
Major Law of Wooden Bastion (Elemental Law of Wood)\par
Major Law of Undying Might (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
Major Law of Pure Forging (Elemental Law of Steel)\par
Key Skills:\par
Regenerative Heartwood (Passive) [Epic]: Grants the wielder extraordinary recovery. Damaged bark rapidly heals. \par
 Spirit Steel Body (Passive) [Epic]: Gives the body the durability and density of Spirit Steel. Extremely resistant to both slashing and concussive damage. Steel grade scales with Level.\par
 (!) Ironwood Smash (Active) [Epic]: The wielder delivers an enormously powerful wind-up punch infused with the essence of Steel. A devastating finishing move. \par
So it was another boxer. Like normal Bark Sentinels. Though this one seemed to be more of a brute—no 'martial arts master' type Skill. Just a really strong smash.\par
Zane hadn't gotten a good test of his new body yet. So far, nothing could even move him. This was a good chance. He gave Evan a look.\par
At this point Evan got the drill. He scampered off to the side. There he gave a little wave, ready to cheerlead. "You show 'em who's boss!"\par
Zane smiled a little. He found himself smiling a lot this dungeon raid. Maybe it was being around Evan with his new empathy Skill. It was like being around a bonfire of feeling; you couldn't help but feel warm.\par
Zane got his Chains out. No Axes. He just wrapped them around his fist like boxing wraps, then mashed them together to test them. They made a thick deep CLUNK. Good weight.\par
Then he set his arms on Stormfire and put on maximum density. Instantly he started sinking into the ground. It was a lot of weight, even for him. It took some effort to put his arms up.\par
The Monster began to stir. It seemed to react to the Stormfire. The lines on its face creased thicker. It let out a crackling groan, angling to face him. It put up its arms in turn.\par
He took a step. And sank half a foot into Titansteel. The whole chamber trembled; puffs of dust shook out from the ceiling.\par
The Overlord stepped too. The chamber shook then too. The ground sagged under its weight. Zane grinned.\par
He took another step, then another. So did the Overlord. And they were charging each other now full speed, sending quakes rippling down the chamber, clashing, rupturing in splintering splashes.\par
The Overlord struck first. It lunged; its arm swung like a baseball bat. And Zane ducked it. He uncorked his answer—and his fist landed clean.\par
Stormfire Punch!\par
It sank into the belly of the beast, sank through the steel surface layer, then the crunchier, softer, stringier stuff underneath—and just kept going. Dense Steel Laws tried desperately to keep him out. But Zane was so heavy, so powerful now there was something undeniable about the punch—it kept breaking layer after layer, crunching and crackling as it went. It wasn't even that fast. But the momentum was monstrous. It finally ground to a halt the way a freight train pulls into a station.\par
By then he was elbow deep into the Monster's body. He blinked at it. The Overlord's body was reinforced Titansteel—woven through with Steely Density and Undying Might. And it felt like wallpaper. Huh.\par
Then it all erupted.\par
A grenade of Stormfire went off right in the middle of its body. He felt the energy blossoming up and out, ripping through everything it touched.\par
The Overlord's mouth gaped wide, and Zane saw a white-red glow steaming out of it—the Stormfire licking up its throat. This thing was done. That fast. It surprised even him.\par
Well—it was done for. Not quite done. He let down his guard a little too soon.\par
It raised that steel pillar of an arm, and the whole thing flared with Law, with essence. It had to be that smash Skill. He tried to pull his arm out. He couldn't manage it in time.Unauthorized use: this story is on Amazon without permission from the author. Report any sightings.\par
And it clobbered him in the head. CLUNK—CRACK! \par
It swung like a baseball bat. It hit like a baseball bat too. But with spikes on the end. Which felt just as unpleasant as he expected. It was the single hardest shot he'd ever taken straight to the face, and that was really saying something. His head whipped nearly all the way around. Blinding pain spiked up his temple; blood spattered out, blinding one of his eyes.\par
But somehow the Overlord felt in more pain than he was. Frowning, he looked up.\par
The thing hit him so hard it shattered its arm on his head. Huh.\par
It seemed to be a pattern with these Bark Sentinels. He finally yanked his arm out its body—just in time for the other spike-arm to smash him in the face. CLUNK-CRACK! \par
This time he face-planted straight into the ground.\par
His ears rang awfully. His head spun. His whole face felt like it was on fire. His skin was pretty cut up; he was dribbling blood all over his face. He was pretty sure his nose was broken. His cheekbone might be too.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%!\par
That sucked.\par
But on the bright side, the Overlord's essence was an ebbing puddle. And it now had no arms—they were broken off at the elbows; a shattered halo of splinters and spikes lay strewn on the floor.\par
It'd just chucked its two best shots at him, by the looks of it. And he ate them head-on.\par
Other than his face being broken—which happens so often he kind of expected at this point—he was pretty okay. Better than okay—he felt good. He felt warm. He licked his lips.\par
Then the Monster started to freak out. Maybe from how not-dead he looked, or maybe from all the Stormfire roasting it from the inside. It came flailing at him in a panic. And he took it to task.\par
It swung blindly at him. Even without Sage Mind he would've seen it coming a mile off. He ducked and fed it a Stormfire fist—and this time, his fist made it all the way through, caught air on the other side. When he pulled it back out, there was a giant hole in the middle of its face.\par
It staggered back, flailing for balance. He leaped in and booted it in the chest. Just for fun. His foot went all the way through it—it felt like cardboard, this thing!\par
Then he just started blasting holes. Up its arms, up its chest, up its head. It started toppling and wobbling like it was drunk. Zane hunched in and walked it down. This was really fun; he liked this. He felt like some kind of indestructible Terminator. Other than his broken face. He was relentless; he just came on and on, brutalizing the thing. He blasted it twice to the head, taking off everything over the neck in beautiful violent arcs. Each shot sent wood chips spinning all over the place. Each shot made a new hole. CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH!\par
Sometimes, he saw videos of those martial arts masters chopping wood blocks with their bare hands. He never really got the appeal of it until now. Except rather than plywood, he was hitting reinforced Titansteel. This was fun.\par
He was almost sad when it all smoked to white.\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 95 -> 96\par
That thing had been level 97.\par
He doubted anything under Level 100 could do much to him now. 100… He got the sense that was some kind of benchmark. A lot of people got stuck on 99. He got the impression the difference between 99 and 100 was not the difference between 98 and 99. Something changed there.\par
Hmm.\par
He wondered how he stacked up against those folks. Was anyone past Level 100? Maybe not. That Eze guy was World Rank 3, and he was still at 99—Reina said he was still breaking through in San Francisco, so…\par
'Titansteel Root’, a B-grade treasure, lay in the middle of the chamber. Another Steel-comprehension treasure. Zane was picking up quite a lot of these things. First those Leaves, now this… he still had a play or two of that one Elder's recording too, didn't he? When he was ready to break through to Elemental he'd have a treasure trove at his disposal.\par
He picked it up and kept climbing.\par
***\par
They picked up some more Sap along the way. Soon the tunnels got tighter and tighter; the spirals got steeper too. The mini-map showed all kinds of tunnels crisscrossing around them, going out to ridges and platforms, winding back in. But theirs just kept going up.\par
After a while, he felt a little tug on the back of his shirt.\par
“Um Zane? Do you think we're past the clouds?"\par
He nodded.\par
They kept climbing, and the air started to change. You could feel it getting colder and colder—and quick too. And at a certain crispy freshness to it, like air on a snowy mountain peak. Frost started forming on the walls, on the floor…\par
Somewhere far above, there was open air.\par
They were getting close. This could be the final ascent.\par
Soon they started hearing thumps, crackles in the distance. He felt another little tug on the back of his shirt. "Um Zane?" It was Evan again, feeling nervous. Even more than usual. "Do you think that's the Final Boss?"\par
"Could be. Probably."\par
“…It sounds mad…”\par
More sounds streaming through. … Was that screaming?\par
Then the ground started to shiver. So did the walls. There was a deep groaning noise; it roared down the tunnel. And everything started to shake—as though they were stuck underground and an earthquake was starting. The ceiling started creaking; cracks croaked open, widening fast, spilling reams of dust.\par
Shit.\par
He scooped Evan up—Evan squealed as he did—and made sure to shield the boy with his body, so if something fell it wouldn't hit him. Then Zane ran for it. He poured in Volt Steps. Suddenly he was shooting up the quivering tunnel. In hindsight all this was kind of silly, since Evan was faster. Zane wasn't really thinking then; some protective instinct just kicked in.\par
Then a notification popped up.\par
You are nearing the Boss Lair. A party is currently challenging the Final Boss. A Lair Lock is in place. The Lock will vanish shortly after their attempt concludes. \par
Zane only read it when he burst out onto the surface.\par
He emerged on a bough and saw nothing but clear dark-blue sky above, twinkling with a gorgeous spray of stars, brilliantly white. This was the highest bough of them all.\par
It was a plateau of firm steel leaves, matted with streaks of frost. Herds of clouds milled underneath; pinprick lights twinkled somewhere far, far below… he wasn't looking at that. He stared at the center of the bough.\par
It looked like a war zone. Deep craters littered all over. Spires of Titansteel twisted aimlessly out of the ground. Massive steel boulders studded the place, glowing ominously, smoking essence, smoking every single Steel Law Zane knew—and some he didn't. Angry essence lingered over the mess like blood leaking out of a wound.\par
Zane's mini-map showed a graveyard of X's. So many they overlapped one another, blotting each other out; so many it was impossible to count.\par
There were only three dots left on the mini-map. Three beings left standing.\par
One looked to be a warrior. He was big and burly; he must've cut an impressive figure once—except now he was missing an arm. Blood gushed out of the stump of his shredded black suit. His other arm held a flaming scimitar. He was rattling in deep, desperate breaths.\par
Alejandro Mendes\par
Essence Level 99\par
Class: Infernal Berserker\par
Signature Title: Burning Heart Sage \par
Faction: Tomb Kings\par
Then there was his support, a Ranger who still had all his limbs—but he looked just as bedraggled. He was soaked through with blood. It looked to be his own.\par
Anthony Brown\par
Essence Level 98\par
Class: Arcane Archer \par
Faction: Tomb Kings\par
Then there was the thing in the middle.\par


\section{96. Final Boss (II) }
\par
It was an eldritch horror. A skyscraper of Titansteel towering on four looming gray pillars. Two gnarled trees climbed out of its back. Their silver trunks sizzled with essence and power and Law—Law like Zane had never seen. He felt that Law in his soul—like all this time he'd been playing a note slightly off-tune. And now he heard how it was meant to be played, full and clear and strong. Pure.\par
The Treant bellowed. Its voice sounded like it came from deep down, a titanic echoing sound.\par
Titansteel Treant (Monster) \par
 Essence Level 100 \par
 Laws: \par
Elemental Law of Steel \par
 Key Skills: \par
 Stellar Ironfall (Active) [Legendary]: Summons asteroids of pure Titansteel borne of essence and pure Elemental Law with which to annihilate the enemy. After each Ironfall, the Treant undergoes a recharge.\par
Magnetic Field Mastery (Active) [Epic]: Generates a magnetic field that effects all metal-based objects in a general radius with overwhelming force. \par
(!) Steelroot Domain (Active) [Epic]: Grants complete control over a vast network of Steelroots, each infused with the Elemental Law of Steel. At this Level, each root has durability equivalent to an A-grade Treasure.\par
\par
The Monster had exactly one Law. The Elemental Law of Steel.\par
Zane was a little shocked it was only Level 100. It hardly had a scratch on it—and it was fighting a Level 99 Signed and the Level 98 Archer too. What was the difference?\par
And that Level 99 had to be that Marquis they were talking about. World Rank \#12, Alejandro Mendez. The man let out a strangled scream. He was choked with pain, with rage. He dashed for it; he was blinding fast—as fast as Evan even. Shocking for someone his size. Fire bloomed at his feet. He was a blazing rush, a comet streaking straight for the Treant.\par
The sheer power in that step… it felt as explosive as a Rising Storm Slash. He was strong.\par
Then the bough erupted.\par
It was as though those silver leaves were the surface of a lake. And some great octopus-monster lay beneath the surface, just waiting. Roots sprung out of the ground like so many tentacles. They swallowed the Marquis' legs whole. They wrapped up his chest. They took all that exploding power and snuffed it out like a candle. He ground to a brutal standstill.\par
He howled. He slashed, slashed again with his scimitar, pouring fuming blasts into those Titansteel roots. Each strike there was an explosion. Each strike left a molten red gash. But the roots held strong as ever.\par
"No," he choked. "NO!"\par
He raised another arm to slash. A root burst out like a lunging snake and wrapped that up too.\par
"MARQUIS!" screamed the Archer. He fired off a few shots. They clattered right off.\par
Then the trees on the Treant's back began to shine. Spots of shadow drifted over the battlefield, growing quickly bigger, blotting out the light of the stars.\par
The Marquis looked up, shaking.\par
Above him hung an asteroid field of pure Steel. The Laws infused in it were breathtaking, incomprehensible; the essence was like nothing Zane had ever felt. It all hung there, suspended, spinning slowly, little planets of swirling Steel. Suddenly it felt very hard to breathe. Even from out here Zane could feel the weight of it. It wasn't just pressuring his body—it was pressuring his soul. They were so dense he could literally feel their gravitational pull. Around them there was a circle of bending air.\par
Then the Marquis felt only despair. The planets fell.\par
He tried slashing. He might as well have done nothing. His red lines couldn't even leave a scratch. He wore his defiance plain on his face as the first asteroid struck.\par
It struck him. It went through him. It sank until you could barely see its surface over the steel bough.\par
The rest of the asteroids landed. Hammering over the first. THUD. THUD. THUD. There was an utter finality to the sounds. Each one shook the whole tree; they threw Evan off his feet; Evan cried out, but Zane caught him and held firm.\par
They weren't even necessary. After the first asteroid landed, there was already an X on the mini-map where the Marquis had stood.\par
Then it was over. The trees on the Treant's back dimmed, recharging. The Archer stared in dumb shock.If you encounter this story on Amazon, note that it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\par
He ran screaming. He ran up against the edge of the Lair Lock, the blue wall separating Zane, and Evan, and him. All Zane felt from him was naked horror. You could see it stark on his face. "Help me!" He sobbed. "Please!"\par
"Hold on! I'm coming!" cried Evan. He tried running over, but Zane held him back.\par
"Let me go!" Evan struggled. But Zane just shook his head. There was nothing they could do.\par
The Archer choked. He started to float, started to thrash like some invisible force had him firmly in its grasp. His belt. His necklace. They were Steel.\par
Something ripped him away. Yanked him flying at the Treant at highway speeds. The Treant swatted him with its pillar of an arm. An arm as dense as Zane was. Just so much bigger.\par
The Archer was Level 98. It was easy to forget when he exploded like that.\par
Evan let out a choked gasp.\par
A notification popped up.\par
The party has been defeated.\par
"No…" whispered Evan. For some reason, he felt near tears.\par
Boss Lair is in reset mode. All Active Skills are forbidden until full reset completes. Lair unlocks in 5 minutes.\par
The Treant snorted and closed its eyes. It settled down, going dormant. The boulders studding the ground melted away; the essence flowed back to the Treant. The craters started filling back up. The bough grew level again. Healing, resetting, wiping all evidence of the slaughter away.\par
Zane looked back.\par
The path behind them had fully caved in. It was gone—even gone on the mini-map. The only way down lay deep in the Treant's Lair. And that was sealed off on the mini-map. Zane could guess the condition to unseal it.\par
Lair unlocks in 4 minutes\par
Zane set Evan down and knelt beside him. Evan curled up a little; he was sniffling. He felt awful.\par
He felt awful about the Tomb Kings, even—he felt awful he couldn't help them, even when they asked him to. He felt awful he had to watch them die like that. It felt a little odd to Zane, but Evan could feel bad for pretty much anything, Zane found.\par
Above all he felt really, really scared. He felt so scared he couldn't even think, the kind of fear a rabbit might feel in the middle of a road staring at the headlights the moment before it gets crushed under the wheels.\par
It was way too much. For him and for Zane—it was hard just standing next to him right now. This would not do.\par
So Zane knelt and took his hand. "Look at me," he said as gently as he could. "Listen to me." He wasn't sure what to say. Then he remembered what Reina did to calm down; she had all these visualization and meditation tricks that went way over his head. But the simplest—"Listen to my voice. Breathe. In… out… focus on my voice."\par
"Zane?" sniffled Evan.\par
"Shh. No talking. I need you to trust me. Can you do that?"\par
Evan nodded, still trembling. "Good. Close your eyes. In. Out. In… out… good."\par
He could feel what Evan was feeling. To Evan, it just felt like a deep, smooth voice was wrapping him up. And he felt Zane's big warm hands on his own.\par
"Forget everything else. I need you here. I need you now. Listen to me. Are you listening?"\par
Evan nodded quickly.\par
"That thing is strong," Zane said. Then he pointed a thumb at his own chest. "I am also strong. I am very strong. You know this."\par
Evan nodded quickly again. "Un!"\par
"And you are very fast. You can deal lots of damage very quickly. Together, we will be way stronger than either of us alone. Together, we will beat this thing."\par
"We will?"\par
"Of course. I am sure of it," Zane said. He wasn't at all sure. But he said it with the calmness of someone who was sure. It kind of seemed to work.\par
Evan didn't even have empathy like Zane. Weirdly though, something about Zane's calmness seemed to be infecting him too. He was breathing a little less quickly; the knot in his chest was unwinding.\par
"But—but what if—"\par
"No."\par
"But—"\par
"No buts. We are going to win. I promise."\par
Evan swallowed and nodded. "Okay."\par
"Say it."\par
"We're—we're gonna win."\par
Zane frowned. "Say it like you mean it."\par
"We're gonna win!"\par
"We will beat this thing, won't we?"\par
"Yes!"\par
"We will beat this thing. And we will save Northern California once and for all."\par
"Yes!" When Evan looked up again, his eyes were a little watery. Zane just felt warmth gushing out of him now. He felt the bond between their souls strengthening a little.\par
Was this that 'Power of Friendship' Skill again?\par
He blinked. He hadn't meant for this to happen. But he'd take it. More importantly, Evan was on his feet again. He felt determined. He felt ready.\par
Lair unlocks in 3 minutes.\par
Zane gazed out at the Treant again, this time with an eye for its weaknesses. Like a lot of these Bosses, its joints flared up faintly red. But most of the red, surprisingly, showed up on its back. Those trees… they also seemed to be what were powering those steel meteors. They seemed to channel its essence. They had to cut that off first. Then they could take down the main body.\par
"Okay," said Zane. "Here's what we're going to do."\par
If Reina were here, she'd do a lot better—but neither Zane nor Evan was particularly good at strategizing. And there wasn't much time anyway. So they cobbled together a basic plan, something they could both stick to.\par
Lair unlocks in 1 minute.\par
Time to put it all out there.\par
***\par
The blue barrier dropped. And Zane instantly stepped out in front, marching for the Monster. Evan came up behind, sword shining. "Sunblade Slash!" he cried.\par
An arc of gold flashed through the air and bit into the wood of the tree, drawing a bright gash in the bark. A branch went flying. Not a lot, but it was definitely something. The Treant felt a burst of surprise at the sheer speed of it; its giant face curved into a frown.\par
Then the ground behind Zane erupted. Roots lashed for Evan's feet, for his arms; he cried out, stumbling, darting away, but it was like trying to not get wet when you were standing in the middle of an ocean.\par
Before the Monster could firm a grip, Zane roared. And he charged. It was still angry at Evan—it pretty much ignored Zane. No good. He had to get its attention. He drew his Axes. They flared with Stormfire and he whipped them into a Rising Storm Slash. Aimed straight at those trees on its back.\par
Only then did the Treant turn around. It felt the sheer force coming at it; something about Stormfire seemed to unsettle it. And suddenly all its attention was on Zane. A wall of roots surged out of the ground, catching Slash. The blast was immense. Steel essence and Steel Laws swarmed Stormfire. Snuffing it out. It was the first time Zane had ever seen Stormfire snuffed out.\par
But the vines slouched off too, sliced in half.\par
Now the Treant was really frowning. And Zane felt the change in its attitude—even as Evan's little gold slashes went off in the background. It saw Zane as the true threat. It decided to crush Zane first.\par
And the ground started bubbling around him. The air began to shimmer.\par
Zane let out a tight breath.\par
Here it comes!\par
\par


\section{97. Final Boss (III) }
\par
Zane just had to survive. Survive and do what damage he could. He had to keep its attention on him so Evan could chip away in the background.\par
It turned out much harder than it sounded.\par
The bough erupted around him. He felt like a small boat caught in a vicious storm. Titansteel roots towered like tsunami waves.\par
Then a root reared out of the ground and snagged his arm whip-quick. Another caught his leg; another wrapped his waist, coiling like a python. He slashed at them, but he could hardly force his axehead past that shiny skin.\par
A top World Ranker couldn't break this—he saw why now. It had the power of Elemental steel. Only Stormfire could stand up to it, and even then it was rough going. The root held stubborn.\par
In a blink another root snatched up his last free arm. Then all of it yanked with a monstrous strength. The Treant's fury washed over him. It was trying to force him to his knees.\par
He roared. He set his body on Stormfire. Everything. He shoved in as much essence as he could bear; he willed it to go as hot as it could. He'd burn his way out if he had to. It took a huge effort but he ripped an arm free—Stormfire loosened the hold. Brute strength did the rest. He got an Axe back. Then he just started slashing.\par
Rising Storm Slashes blitzed through the air, one after another. An intense heat bloomed at the middle of that grotesque tangle; red-white lines carved through the air, crisscrossing, cackling. Soon he'd freed his legs. The roots kept trying to wrap him up but he beat them back, kept slashing fast as he could, as furiously as he could. It felt like trying to cut his way through a forest with a blunt knife.\par
It took nine or ten full-power Rising Storm Slashes to get through it all. By the end of it, he stood in a blackened smoking crater.\par
Then he felt something immense over his head and looked up. He felt the gravity of it before he saw it. Stars brought low to earth, hovering there, spinning, warping the air around them…\par
Shit.\par
This was that Legendary Skill. Ironfall. What the Treant been setting up all along. The thing that had one-shot the World Rank \#12. It fell so hard, so blistering fast, he knew he couldn't react in time.\par
So he didn't react. He used Sage Mind.\par
He took in each of those five seething meteors bearing down over him. He held each of them in his mind, held the Monster's will in his mind, held all their shifting trajectories at once…\par
Then they blasted at him.\par
He had a split-second to react. Volt Step! \par
He skidded out of the way and heard the air screaming behind him. An explosion rocked the bough. The rest were already on him. He leaped out of the way of another, heard a great shattering off to the left—but things were changing. The Treant was learning. It was tracking him as he ran. He clawed the ground hard, lurched to a halt—a meteor raged past him, sinking a yawning ditch into the steel. The impact threw his grips from the ground. Essence blasted him in the face. It was just recoil and it still hurt.\par
No time. He had to Volt Step again. He felt a huge glut of power streak toward him; he wrenched hard left—too late. It was already falling; it was going to hit him. He couldn't get out of the way in time. Shit.\par
A desperate try—he sank his Axe into the ground as he leaped. He used Steely Density to make his body as light as he could. He had to roll with the blow; he braced for it.\par
Then it struck.\par
He heard a sickening chorus of cracks. His body compressed so fast he thought he might pop like a blood balloon.\par
He went flying. The essence gored into him. It didn't even hit him clean, and still—\par
Warning! \par
Health under 75\%!\par
He hit the end of his Chain, snagged there, and went flying in a sorry semi-circle. And then he was mid-air, halfway through the loop, face-to-face with the last meteor. It was still there, hovering, gleaming. Waiting. He felt the Treant's cruel intent locking on him.\par
Fuck.\par
He yanked on his Chain hard, trying to get out of the way. He almost managed it too.\par
Then meteor ran through him.\par
It jarred him so hard he didn't even register slamming into the bough. Crashing into hard steel felt like a caress in comparison. It felt like every bone in his body had shattered. Everything hurt. Foreign essence, foreign Law lay heavy in his body, swamping him, crushing him. Even Stormfire had trouble burning it all out.Unauthorized use: this story is on Amazon without permission from the author. Report any sightings.\par

He had to get up. His body screamed bloody protest, but he forced himself to his feet. If he was down, there was nothing protecting Evan. He hurt like hell. But he could still fight. He smiled; he tasted his own hot salty blood.\par
The Treant was recharging. Its trunks were spluttering, a little dim. Roots were still sprouting all over the place, but there'd be a little break before it could rain hell on him again.\par
Through blurry eyes, Zane saw Evan had managed to carve a gold line through half a tree. A little less than he hoped… Zane wasn't sure he could take another one of those Ironfalls. He was lucky none of those meteors hit him head-on. Even with that last one, he'd partly got out of the way. He got clipped, not crushed.\par
That Marquis took one to the face. And was annihilated. He was pretty sure he was stronger than that Marquis. But something about those meteors… he didn't trust anything without an Elemental Law to take many of those head-on.\par
He just had to make sure they didn't hit him square. He licked his lips. He could do that.\par
***\par
Those root-vines were on him again almost instantly. They gave him no room to breathe. The difference between Level 99 and 100 just kept surprising him—was it just the Elemental Law making this Boss so much stronger? It powered every technique. Like using jet fuel instead of normal gas or something. It was absurd.\par
Zane just kept slashing, burning himself out. Every move hurt. He was pretty broken, but he had long figured out the difference between broken and broken broken. The first kind was pretty bad. But you could still keep going for a while if you just bit down and ignored all the flaring, biting pain.\par
The Treant frowned at him, growling that echoing cavernous growl. He spit out a mouthful of blood and grinned at it. Bring it! That gold line on its trunk was only getting longer and longer…\par
Wait.\par
When he reached out to it, he felt a dark undercurrent. He couldn't read thoughts, just feelings, intent—so it took him a moment to catch on.\par
When he did, his heart sank.\par
Most of its attention was still on snaring him. But its focus was shifting back. Back to Evan.\par
It kept throwing up all these roots up front, but it was trying to trick him—trick both of them—into thinking it only wanted him.\par
But it was looking at Evan on the other side. Evan, whose face curled up in concentration, sweating, standing still, slicing as hard as he could. The ground around him started to bubble...\par
Zane roared. He threw everything he had into a Rising Storm Slash. A desperate try to get its attention. It didn't work. The Treant just ate the shot. One of its trees was now teetering so badly it almost keeled over—it didn't matter. He felt its vicious joy; it got what it wanted.\par
The other half of the bough—Evan's half—erupted with roots. They blanketed everything. Evan cried out, tried getting out of the way, but there was nowhere to go. They caught him by the arms, by the legs, by the throat—\par
Zane was already Volt Blitzing across. Throwing wild slashes, making his body a burning battering ram. He blasted his way straight through, landed at Evan's side in the heart of the thicket. He poured everything into Rising Storm Slashes—once, twice, three times, cut the boy free, wrenched him out of the way.\par
Evan gasped; he choked in air as the roots slipped off his throat. He just felt pure joy. "Zane!" he cried, beaming—he wasn't even shocked. Evan had just... believed. The way a boy believes in a superhero. Somehow he knew since he was in trouble, Zane would save him. He had so much faith in Zane it was baffling.\par
But he was celebrating too early.\par
The roots were all over Zane now. Snagging up his legs, his arms—when he tried to get at them, they wrapped up Evan too. The boy gave a little cry. Now they were both stuck.\par
The Treant gave an ear-splitting screech, a screech of triumph. And Zane felt the Ironfall heaving above him, quickly forming. There was no time. He couldn't free Evan and also himself. He had to make a choice.\par
He strained against that great mass of steel, struggling to drag him down. He defied it. He forced out two huge Rising Storm Slashes, ripped through a knot of steel roots. Then he grabbed Evan out of the mess.\par
He threw the boy hard, hoping against hope. It was the last thing he managed before they dragged him under.\par
By now he knew there was no getting out. There were so many root-vines coiling around every one of his limbs he wasn't getting free—not in time. He was too late. He'd just burned all the time he had left.\par
The Ironfall hung over him fully made. Three huge globes of steel, surging pure dense essence. This close it was impossible to breathe. There was so much essence seething off them it was like looking at three blazing suns.\par
…Fuck. \par
Then they fell on him. All at once.\par
With the last of his strength, he forced his broken arm to move, forced it to strain against six python roots. Forced all of his essence into one last defiant Rising Storm Slash. He gave it all he had.\par
It might've been the most Rising Storm Slash he'd ever thrown. It carved a wicked, shining, curving, beautiful red-white scar on the first meteor. It looked like he was carving a crescent moon on a full moon. The sheer force of it sent the meteor careening out of the way.\par
That took out one. The problem was two more were still falling. And he was still strapped down like a prisoner on death's row. There was just no time.\par
He'd barely started his second Rising Storm Slash when the second meteor hit him.\par
Then he was on the ground again. He was in so much pain it was all he felt. No touch, no sound, no smell—just a blinding, brilliant pain.\par
Warning! \par
Health under 25\%!\par
That just wrecked a third of his Health. It felt like it did more. He had to get up—he was lucky just to live through this one. He wasn't surviving a third. He raged at his legs, tried forcing them up, but all they gave him was more pain.\par
It seemed most of him was broken broken.\par
He didn't care. He built up to an arm. He heard roots snapping as they tried to keep him down. But he wouldn't go quietly; his blood still ran hot. He'd keep thrashing. If it wanted to kill him, he'd make it earn every bit of it. He kept smiling through it all, a bloody, toothless smile. He had to get up—\par
He heard a scream—was that Evan? So the boy had made it out after all.\par
The last thing he felt was relief.\par
Then the meteor struck. And crushed him.\par
There was a tremendous shattering.\par
Then everything went still.\par


\section{98. Final Boss (IV)}
\par
Zane floated in darkness. A sightless, soundless void. He couldn't feel his body—he couldn't feel much of anything.\par
He could guess what'd happened.\par
Well. He supposed that was it.\par
He wished he had a chance to let Reina know he was sorry.\par
Not for helping Evan. He had no regrets there—he was quite happy about that, actually.\par
He was just sorry he let himself lose. To a tree, too. It was kind of embarrassing. He guessed that was life.\par
The one thing he could feel right now was pain. A bright hot cloud of it, soaking him through.\par
…He hadn't thought death would hurt this much.\par
Something floated there under the cloud of pain. He tried focusing on it. He couldn't see it.\par
But there was something else, something burning away the cloud, something warm and bright—not harshly bright like the pain but soothing bright, like a hearth.\par
He knew that flame.\par
That was Fiery Renewal.\par
Why was it so strong? It was almost like it'd jumped a full Skill Level.\par
Soon enough of the cloud burned away. And he saw what he'd been looking for.\par
Warning!\par
Critical Health\par
Savage Body activated!\par
Strength increased to 50\%\par
Speed increased 50\%\par
Vitality increased 50\%\par
So he was still alive.\par
This was a pleasant surprise. He could feel it now—his Health was a tiny stream trickling through him, barely there. So little it was almost nothing. It was the closest he'd ever been to death.\par
But he wasn't dead. He was healing. How? That last shot… there was no way he'd survived it. Savage Body must've helped blunt the blow. It couldn't have been enough.\par
He felt something pouring into his soul. A bond. There was someone on the other side, someone pouring warmth, pouring love and hope into him. Now he looked for it, he could feel it making him stronger, literally. It powered up Fiery Renewal. It powered up his steel body even—made it a Level stronger. That, plus all the rest, was what'd borne him through.\par
Huh.\par
It was that Power of Friendship Skill, he realized. It boosted the Skills of all Evan's friends—its power depended on the bond. It'd been pretty strong before. But this felt different—orders of magnitude stronger.\par
Evan must've seen what Zane had done. And somehow it made a difference? It was the only thing he could come up with.\par
He’d been saved by the Power of Friendship.\par
…Wow. \par
He'd recovered enough now he could feel his body again. He almost wished he hadn't—his lungs felt squished flat; he could scarcely drag in a breath. His whole body felt squished flat. He wasn't sure there was a single thing in him—bone, muscle, organ—that hadn't ruptured. He could feel the full weight of the meteor bearing down on him. This must be what roadkill felt like in their last moments of life. Very unpleasant.\par
He felt a soul nearby. A very familiar soul in massive distress. It was straining hard. And Zane felt all the steel over him start to shift. This was also very unpleasant—he felt like dough being slowly kneaded. Lots of things, already broken things, crackled and popped inside him.\par
A gap opened up and light poured through. He blinked. It hurt just to look at it. There was Evan, panting heavily, looking down. The boy's whole body was glowing. Zane could faintly see the Treant recharging in the background. Then it disappeared behind Evan's head—Evan had knelt down next to him, leaning over him. He was sobbing.\par
"Nooooo!" He cried. He cradled Zane's head. Which sent pain flaring up and down his neck. "Stay with me, Zane! C'mon! No, no, no—don't you die on me!"If you spot this story on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.\par
The boy was swamped with despair. He really thought this was the end. Zane tried saying something, couldn't manage it at first, gave a bloody cough. Evan gasped. "Zane!"\par
Then Zane reached up a slow, shaky hand and flicked him in the head. Evan blinked.\par
"Not… dying," Zane croaked. His throat burned with every syllable.\par
"…oh."\par
"Will be… fine."\par
He pointed at the tree. "You. Kill. Tree. I. Be right… there…”\par
He groaned, laying back. “First… rest…”\par
Evan wiped away tears, sniffling. "Okay…”\par
"Counting… on you."\par
Evan nodded very quickly. A new fire lit in his watery eyes. “Okay!”\par
“Go."\par
And Evan jumped up, suddenly bursting with anger and joy all at once. He burned so hot with it Zane had to turn away, groaning a little; it felt like his soul was blinded. Evan felt like he had against that eagle boss. But this was so much more intense—so intense Zane was getting pumped up, and he was only feeling secondhand emotions.\par
Evan's Signature Skills—his Power of Friendship, his Power of Determination—were showing in full force. He was burning with so much power right now his eyes were literally shining. Was it Zane's imagination or was his hair floating a little too?\par
Evan screamed a battle cry. Then he leaped for it. And Zane gave a little smile. He regretted it instantly. It really hurt.\par
***\par
He caught the action through bleary eyes. The Treant was still recovering; it seemed halfway there. But when Evan blitzed for it, it perked up. Roots exploded out of the ground, walling up the path, grasping at Evan's legs—but Evan just whipped out his sword. "Sunblade arc!"\par
It was shockingly strong, almost as strong as Rising Storm Slash. The difference was in the time it took for Zane to throw one, Evan blitzed out five.\par
Roots reared up and gold instantly mowed them down. Those Sunblade slashes were blink-fast, so fast you couldn't see them moving, just the aftermath. The gold carved all the way through the teetering trunk.\par
One arc struck. Then another, and another—so fast they blended into the same shot. And the tree toppled.\par
Zane propped himself up to an elbow; he was almost past Critical Health now—he could almost feel his legs. But he just watched. He sensed something special was happening.\par
The ground under Evan's pattering feet was like a roiling, angry ocean. The Treant kept trying to catch him—kept trying to swamp him. Its Titansteel roots shot up high, crashed down like riptides, and Evan just flitted out the way, slashing and slashing and slashing—\par
The other tree was getting marked up now too. It started to wobble. There was nothing the roots could do. Evan's sword was moving so fast it marked a golden semicircle in the air, a little halo of intensely brilliant gold. Nothing could touch him—it was a gold that drowned out everything. The ground didn't look Titansteel gray-brown anymore; it was only a paler shade of gold. Evan was shining like never before. Not just his body but his soul.\par
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" cried Evan as he slashed. His aura was going supernova.\par
The Treant could feel it too. It felt deeply threatened then. It felt it had to go all out. And its strongest power had finally recharged.\par
Clots of gray steel spread over a dark sky, thickening fast. This time the roots didn't even go for Evan. Instead they shot up around him in a thick circle, caging him in. The Ironfall hung above. There was no escape.\par
But Evan was still burning; he glared up at the Ironfall. He wasn't the least bit scared of it. He was a little ball of fury and bravery, just blazing with pure feeling. And as that first meteor fell, a golden arc rose to greet it—it was so bright it made everything else seem dim; it was like the first light of sunrise after a long dark night.\par
Zane felt a new Law there. He blinked. …Had Evan just comprehended a Law mid-fight?\par
The boy really was in another world right now. Far, far beyond his natural limits in some special state—Zane had never seen anyone else do that kind of comprehension before… it was something he thought only he could do.\par
It was something only he could do. Zane sensed it then. He sensed it through their bond—the way Power of Friendship was drawing on him. Not taking, but… sharing? In that moment, in this crazy trance of his, Evan felt closer to him soul-wise than ever.\par
Evan’s slash met the meteor. Its Laws weren't as strong but its essence was undeniable. Zane expected an explosion, but no—it just sliced its way clean through. And the halves fell away, cratering into the ground. Steel essence rushed out like hurricane winds, stripping leaves from the bough as they passed.\par
Another meteor shot at Evan. And his sword flashed again, lighting up the night. Two down. Then three. Zane watched as the last meteor fell to a blitz of gold. One more slash brought down the wall of roots. Then there was nothing between the boy and the Treant.\par
Evan was starting to burn out. He'd burned too hot, too fast—but he screamed and put his all into one last slash. “Hi-ya!”\par
It took that final tree right off the Treant’s back. As it broke off, its silvery glow dimmed. The essence in it died out. The beast spasmed, bellowing; an immense pain came over it. Roots fell like sloshing waves, petering out. Some core part of its powers was broken.\par
Then there was Evan. Breathing hard, still smoking gold essence. He fell to his knees. He was pretty cooked—he'd asked of his body far, far too much. But he kept trying to will himself to go on.\par
He felt a big hand on his shoulder. He looked up, blinking. Zane gave him a nod. "You did good. I'm proud of you."\par
"Really?" Evan beamed. Now he felt all warm on top of all that tiredness.\par
“You can rest. I’ll take it from here."\par
"Un!" The boy nodded. Then he slumped like a ragdoll. Zane got the sense he wouldn't be waking up for a very long time.\par
Zane brought his Axes out and took a breath.\par
Fiery Renewal had boosted his Health up near 50\%. And the Treant looked to be down about as much—It had lost the root of its power, literally. It was standing now, huge fists clenched. It was still a titan of a thing; it still had a body brimming with Elemental Law. It felt furious it'd been pushed this far. But all this was over now.\par
Its cold eyes locked on his. It wanted to crush him the old-fashioned way.\par
Zane snorted. So you're a brawler now.\par
He clenched his fists too. Well. So am I.\par
It bellowed at him so deeply, so loudly, it sent all the trees on the bough clink-clinking. And Zane roared right back, grinning. He set his Axes on Stormfire.\par
They charged together.\par
This thing might be Level 100. And its body might be tougher than Zane's. And it might have pretty much every physical advantage possible on him—including Health. Its main body looked mostly untouched.\par
But if there was one thing Zane had total confidence in, it was a slugfest.\par


\section{99. Final Boss (V) }
\par
Zane had a cheat code for close combat. It was called Sage Mind.\par
He was just an okay boxer. But with Sage Mind he felt everything coming. It was like having lightning-quick reactions, but better—he could react before reacting was possible. It made fist-fighting so much fun. He felt like that guy from the Matrix sometimes. He didn't move as slickly—usually he just looked like he was blundering all over the place. But his opponents kept missing, to their consternation. Which was also very fun to see.\par
He went in feeling maybe a little too confident.\par
He knew he hit hard. This thing had some levels and some Laws on him, sure. But once he got a few good Rising Storm Slashes in, he knew he could take it.\par
The Treant lumbered toward him. And Zane lumbered at it. He drew out his Chains and wrapped his arms. He wrapped his torso. He made his body as dense as it could go. To fight a heavyweight he had to be a heavyweight.\par
And this thing was a real chunker. Not only was it all Elemental steel, it was like four times his height. Sickly green roots branched its Titansteel skin like poison veins. It had glowing hollows for eyes. Its bark mouth was wide open, bellowing.\par
Zane struck first. Rising Storm Slash!\par
The Treant threw right back. He felt the intent of it—he ducked it with ease. His Axe swung in a lovely arc, headed straight for its craggy face.\par
Then he felt something weird. The Treant was trying to grab him. But not with its limbs—\par
He jerked suddenly sideways. Not only his body—his Axe too. Shit. Suddenly he was tilting all over the place. He missed his Axe; he stumbled to find his footing. A massive shadow fell across him. He looked up.\par
That pillar of a fist was falling on him. A pillar of ultra-dense steel, who knew how many tons, looming over him.\par
He barely had time to throw up his arms. He took it on his Chain-wrapped guard. It still felt like getting hit by a train; the force rippled through his body; he felt it everywhere, down to his toes. He cratered into the ground, bounced hard, flipped over twice, and somehow landed on his feet, panting heavily. His head was still buzzing.\par
What was that?\par
He thought back to its Skills. Magnetism. It had to be.\par
It could affect Spirit Weapons too? And his body, even?\par
He was made entirely of metal.\par
He frowned. This was tricky.\par
But he could still work with this. He spat out a bloody tooth, nodding. He just had to use his brain a little more.\par
They charged each other again like two clashing rhinos. He threw a slash and it slugged a haymaker. But this time he made sure to pay extra attention to mind—how it shifted.\par
The moment he felt magnetism about to yank him, he tracked where it was going. Down left. So at the same time he leaped up and to the right, willing his Axe off-target—on purpose.\par
The moment that brutal magnetic field struck him he felt like a bird caught in a tornado. He couldn't help being dragged along. It was so much stronger now he got up this close.\par
But since he'd jumped the other way it dragged him right where he wanted to be.\par
He thought he was pretty clever until it punched him in the face.\par
He heard bones popping like bubble wrap, felt an explosion of pain, went cartwheeling head over heels. He ate shit. He made a nice long ditch in the bough.\par
Ow.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 25\%\par
He groaned. His face was broken. Again. He was pretty sure it spent more time broken than not today. It was a good thing Level-ups set everything right again. Reina really liked his face—he imagined she'd be pretty bummed if he came back with his nose sideways.\par
He knew what happened. It was his own dumb fault.\par
To use Sage Mind he had to map intent to the real world, which was already finicky. And he had to feel how that Treant perceived magnetism, and feel the way it thought about directions—but it was looking at him, so he had to mirror it when he moved…he got confused. He overshot.\par
But that was okay.\par
He breathed in heavily through his mouth. His nose was such a mess there was no using it anymore; right now all it did was spew blood.\par
So far, not great. But he figured it was like riding a bike. He knew it'd get easier and easier. He wasn't sure why he was so confident, given, well, everything. But he was. He was smiling, even.\par
He leaped at it again. It bellowed, tried hammering him, tried wrenching at him with that magnetic field—and this time, he matched its force perfectly; it dragged him up-left, he went down-right. He almost matched his timing perfectly too. A little off, but good enough. Its pillar-arm sailed right past him; its whole body sailed past him, and he scored two clean gashes down the backs of its knees.The author's tale has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\par
It bellowed, ratting the bough. He could hear the fury, the pain in it. When it charged him it tried messing with him again, but he timed it just right. He got the direction bang-on too. He came out the other side untouched. It sported two fresh scars up its torso. Scars blazing red, crackling white. The Stormfire smoldered, taking hold.\par
Zane wasn't cutting off limbs like he was used to with Rising Storm Slash. But he was scoring deep burns. And the more burns he inflicted the more they stayed, marking angry glowing lines up and down its body, sinking deeper and deeper, slowly, steadily. He was bleeding the Monster dry, cut by cut.\par
He danced out of the way like a matador, let it bull-charge past him, and gave it a swift one-two up the nose, clocked it with a wild hook on the side of the head as it swung back, then ducked a massive swing. And its whole face glowed red; it really did look like it was bleeding all over. It tried dragging him down but he planted his feet hard. It tried yanking him as he ran but he rode it like a wave and just kept slashing.\par
He grinned bloodily. He was getting the hang of it. Like riding a bike.\par
One exchange after another. And his belly, its arms, its back, its legs—there were little fires everywhere. Steel started melting out of the wounds because he was burning the whole thing down. It was starting to wobble. It was going down slowly but surely, by degrees, like how a cruise ship might sink.\par
Yes. It was all about the execution. Staying cool-headed even after he'd gotten half his health remaining deleted. Sticking to the plan and doing what he knew he had to do. If Evan was still watching, Zane might've taken a moment here to dispense some more sage advice. A common mistake he noticed in these kinds of situations, especially when near death, was that people started panicking. In his opinion, you should not do that. Just stay calm. If you found yourself panicking, stop.\par
He made a mental note to inform Evan later.\par
Anyway.\par
The Treant was going down. And it could feel it too—it was getting desperate. Zane could feel a thick dark undercurrent; it was cooking up some sort of plot. He frowned.\par
Then it burst out and just charged him, swinging wildly. It bellowed at him . It felt like getting shouted at by a wind tunnel. It was doing something quite silly—it ran straight into his slashes. He got in four or five clean shots; it didn't seem to care. It just kept swinging, all defense forgotten. It fought like a rabid animal; magnetism yanked in randomly this way and that. All it wanted to do was get him off his feet.\par
He had to admit there was something uniquely striking about a Level 100 thirty-foot-tall steel goliath running at you, swinging its windmill arms, bellowing as loud as it could.\par
But Zane followed his own advice. He kept his head, sidestepped and made it pay. If it wanted to be dumb, he'd let it. He was carving it up pretty good.\par
Only now he had a new problem. He was trying to keep all its intents straight, trying to make sense of its mind so he could dodge all its nonsense—but even the Treant didn't know what it was doing. It just knew it was going nuts.\par
He tried leaping out of the way. And it caught him. A good solid hook to the belly. It hadn't even meant to swing that way, but these things happened when you flailed wildly. He spat blood as he flew; he felt a string of organs that'd just healed burst open again.\par
It got lucky.\par
Or maybe it made its own luck? Regardless it got him pretty good there.\par
Warning\par
Critical Health!\par
Savage Body activated\par
Strength increased 50\%\par
Speed increased 50\%\par
Vitality increased 50\%\par
The Treant loomed over him, heaving with triumph. A dense magnetic field glued Zane to the ground. Those massive limbs crashed down—\par
But a new power was coursing through Zane’s body. The single strongest boost he’d felt all day. It set his nerve endings on fire.\par
He spun out of the way hard; the blow streaked past him, thundering the grounds. And he slashed.\par
And when he landed he nearly took the arm off at the joint.\par
This time, his Stormfire took to Titansteel like it was dry wood.\par
The Treant was shocked. How was he so fast? How was he hitting so stupidly hard? It tried flailing at him, tried grabbing him, but it was like fighting a whole different beast.\par
If you got Zane to Critical Health, you better hope you'd crippled him. If not…\par
He gave it another slash, leaped out of the way before it could even turn, and carved it up again.\par
If not, you were in for a bad time.\par
A 50\% increase in Strength, a 50\% increase in Speed… Evan had his super-state. Now it was time for Zane’s.\par
He was a touch from death. But the Boss was in another world of hurt.\par
It reached for him. He wasn't there. It swung for him. He swung right back, and he was the one who landed.\par
The Treant knew it just had to touch him. But it couldn't; it was infuriating. But all it could do about it was scream.\par
Zane was too fast. Too strong.\par
He just poured on the offense, over and over and over, unrelenting—building, if anything. And he was smiling madly; he was really enjoying this. Left, right, making bleeding crosses crosses on bleeding crosses, carving a new statue out of this block of crude steel—he started to laugh.\par
It stumbled.\par
He wasn't sure what blow did it. It probably wasn't any one blow. But all of them were burning at it all at once, bleeding it out. It added up. The Treant stumbled again—then it knelt, keeled over. And Zane was all over it, raining Axes.\par
Skill up!\par
Rising Storm Slash II -> III\par
A little late, he thought. But he'd take it. His Stormfire was eating through the steel faster—his Axe head gorged several inches deeper with each cut. By then it wasn't even necessary.\par
The thing went still. He hacked and hacked—CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!—until—\par
The Titansteel Treant has been defeated!\par
B-ranked Dungeon Titansteel Tree cleared!\par
Then a sea of essence rushed into him, blinding him.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 96 -> 97\par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 97 -> 98\par
Zane breathed out. Ahh… there was that post-fight bliss. The air rushed down his lungs, crisply cold. The moon washed him in a pure cool white. Everything was pleasantly still.\par
He saw essence pouring into Evan too—there was a flash as the boy Leveled up. He didn't move though. He was far from waking up. His body might be healed but his soul still needed a while. He'd burned himself out pretty bad.\par
But Zane would take care of him. He had a feeling Evan would like it back at Luminous Faction Headquarters.\par
Where the Treant used to be, there was a treasure. It looked like a walnut the size of his head; it was veined green and its skin with pure Titansteel.\par
Titansteel Worldseed (B+) \par
 This seed is the heritage of the Titansteel tree. An immense amount of Elemental steel law and pure steel essence is stored within; when consumed it bathes the body in both, creating a potent steel environment. Frequently used to break through bottlenecks in cultivation.\par
Ooh.\par
He put it in his Bag of Holding. Yes. This would come in handy very soon.\par
The Beacon spawned not far from him—on the same bough, right next to a hidden stairwell on the far side. He suspected it went straight down to the ground floor.\par
The dungeon chest spawned with it. It was the size of a tank. A Titansteel safe ribbed with fist-sized bolts, sporting a giant steel lock, gleaming a little. He'd never seen a B-rank dungeon chest before. It sure looked impressive. He wondered if its treasures measured up.\par
He cracked it open eagerly.\par


\section{100. Big Stick}
\par
A bunch of treasures lay inside atop a red plush bed. The first was a piece of paper,\par
smooth and yellow. He'd seen this kind of paper before.\par
Merchants Guild Promissory Note (B)\par
This promissory note can be redeemed for 10 Credits at any auction of the Dragonspire Galaxy Merchants Guild.\par
Well that told him very little. The name' Merchants Guild' rang a bell. He'd gotten an entrance token for this thing back at the Abyssal Crater Dungeon, hadn't he?\par
He wasn't sure what to do with this, so he pocketed it.\par
Next up was a thick book whose cover, spine, and back were made entirely of a bamboo-like wood. The pages seemed hand-scribed too, and as he started flipping through them, he felt them reaching out to his soul—like they were inviting him to sink into them. \par
Tome of Deeproot Healing (B)\par
This tome contains Deeproot Healing, one of the core Skills of the Worldtree Temple's Outer Temple. It sets down roots and draws vital essence from the powers of the earth, granting superhuman regeneration.\par
A Wood healing Skill? It was perfect for Reina. He couldn't wait to give it to her.\par
Speaking of—Worldtree Temple also rang a bell. That was where Reina's Signature Title came from. Zane gathered it was some kind of big Faction out there. His Rising Storm Slash came from the 'Azure Flame Faction,' which he'd seen crop up in more than one Law vision. \par
His Man of Steel Skill he'd gotten from the 'Steelheart Temple.' And there was some electric guild whose name he couldn't quite remember. He'd seen them in his Stormfire vision. \par
He got the sense there were some big factions out there, and they seemed to be themed around an Elemental Law. Worldtree Temple was the woody, planty one.\par
It all felt kind of distant from him right now… still though. He felt like he was piecing things together. According to the Beacon, they were still at Integration Phase 0. He got the feeling at some point this alien stuff would start mattering a lot more.\par
He moved on.\par
Next—a pill.\par
Life Extension Pill (B)\par
Grants an increase of 100 years to the lifespan of any Condensation cultivator. Grants an increase of 50 years to the lifespan of any Foundation cultivator. At this grade, there is no effect for cultivators at Core and above.\par
This didn't seem super useful to him right now at least. But you could trade treasures like this at the Beacon. He wondered how much it would sell for. He'd just give it to Reina; he was sure she'd make good use of it.\par
One item left, and it was a beauty. An ornate breastplate like something a Roman legionnaire might wear, but forged out of Titansteel. An Elemental Law ran through it.\par
Titansteel Chestplate (B)\par
A self-repairing chestplate made of pure Titansteel, woven through with Elemental Steel.\par
Armor was one of the rarest drops. Self-repairing armor was especially rare; it made it a lot more valuable. Zane guessed this granted the same defense as what the Treant had. In other words—really darn tough stuff. Tougher than his body right now.\par
Though he'd change that very soon.\par
This he could give to Avery or Evan. At least Avery could defend herself—Evan was kind of a glass cannon right now. The boy was curled up in a little ball, all peaceful. He made little wheezing sounds as he slept—light little snores. He looked like he was having a very good dream.\par
Yeah, this would go to Evan. Evan must be protected at all costs.\par
That was the last of them. \par
He went back and claimed the Beacon. Then he scooped up Evan. He figured now was a good time to go back. And with the B-ranked Beacon at home base, he should be able to just jump back from here. Right?\par
He was just about to do it when he got a notification.\par
Quest: 'Clear the Titansteel Tree Dungeon' has been cleared!\par
Honestly, he'd forgotten about it until now.\par
Reward: \par
40 high-grade essence stones\par
2 high-grade Law Fruit\par
Dispensing…\par
A little Bag of Holding bobbed in front of him in a cloud of soft light. He nabbed it and checked inside. Sure enough, all there.\par
More Law fruit, huh.\par
At this point it'd be hard not to break whatever bottleneck was in store for him at Level 99. He was drowning in Law Treasures. He'd felt Elemental Steel up close and personal. \par
It was just a matter of letting his soul recover. Then he was going on another Law binge, and he wasn't stopping until he hit it. \par
*** \par
He scooped Evan up again, waited a little for anything else he might've forgotten to pop up. When nothing did, he pulled up the Beacon menu. From there, he willed the teleportation option. And a portal opened up right in front of him. If you find this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the infringement.\par
He stepped on through.\par
He came out in a very familiar town square. He blinked. It used to be every time he came back, he felt like he was walking into a new town. Now the breakneck growth had slowed a little, but he still saw fresh changes every time.\par
The floating watchtower—which had looked like the house from Up when he left, just chained down—seemed a proper flying fortress now. It was fitted with cannons and everything; a giant telescope hung out on top. He looked around. The buildings were still designed the same, all cozy and wood, kind of medieval-feeling. But they'd grown a floor higher. He spotted what looked to be a library, and then a tavern, and the town hall too, a simple tower of lovely old oak. They all wore glowing sky-blue runes.\par
There was a little market going on around him. That's right. They had this whole bartering thing set up one morning a week, didn't they? The shoppers, who'd all been trading tomes and elixirs and stuff, all stopped to stare at him. Some warrior-guards rushed up to greet him, looking quite frazzled.\par
Zane asked where Reina was. And after a lot of saluting, they told him—"She's up near the Olympia Safe Zone, sir. She's meeting with the Harbormasters. They're negotiating some kind of trade deal, sir!"\par
Zane resolved to go meet her. But first, Evan. He got directions to the healing wards. They weren't far from the square.\par
***\par
As he walked, he saw lots of folk in tunics and robes milling on the training fields. Rangers and Priests and Warriors and Rogues all in little teams. He could hear one of them shouting—\par
"The E-ranked dungeon Ravenwood Village reverted yesterday right after midnight! Thankfully, all members present were evacuated. We've been tasked with re-clearing it. Dragon Team, Tiger Team, are you ready?"\par
Both teams gave their salutes. \par
"Garrett—you all healed from last week's raid?"\par
"Yessir!"\par
"Alright. Roll out!"\par
Cheering, they marched away.\par
Zane smiled. Reina did good with this place.\par
***\par
Zane ambled his way to the healing wards, following a cobbled road, just taking in the lovely little headquarters town Reina had made. He let the wide-eyed gazes and the shocked whispers slip over him. By now it was easy to ignore them. Soon he was there.\par
These weren't even wards anymore. It was closer to a hospital. It had four floors, building up in something like a pagoda, all white and gold. Very pretty looking. He strode on in.\par
The receptionist looked up and stared. The quill she was holding dropped from her hands.\par
"Hello," said Zane. "I have a patient for you."\par
Soon it felt like half the doctors in the hospital had scrambled out to greet him. They were all Healers in the Level 30s and 40s, all dressed in white robes, all carrying staffs. The head Healer insisted on taking Zane's patient himself. Zane just wanted some daycare for Evan really, somewhere they'd keep him hydrated and stuff while he was gone. The head Healer said he'd take care of it.\par
Zane recognized him from somewhere. Tall, lanky, blond... When he asked, the Healer smiled and said he was Liam, the pre-med from the University of Washington. He'd been one of the first people Zane had rescued way back when, in the Luminous Forest. Back before he'd made the Faction.\par
Funky stuff.\par
When they inspected who exactly it was Zane was carrying, they freaked out a little. They took extra care as they wheeled Evan onto a cot. Liam promised he wouldn't let any harm come to him—he promised to use their best soul treasures to help him recover.\par
***\par
It was a short trip from the hospital to Olympia Beach, where this diplomatic meeting was taking place. He remembered when they fought a war here. Against Marcus and his Legion. This little jaunt back was shaping up to be a trip down memory lane. \par
Now new ships were docked on the beach. They looked like old Spanish Armada warships, all puffed up with sails and rigging. Very antique.\par
On the beach stood Reina, along with a big pot-bellied man with a twirling white mustache. He wore a sailor's navy uniform, complete with the captain's hat, and he was flanked by a circle of admirals. \par
Rorke Halverson \par
Essence Level 77 \par
Faction: Harbormasters\par
"It was with our help that you won the day—on this very beach, no less! Without the Harbormasters, there would be no Luminous Faction! These terms as you present them, why… it is almost as though you have forgotten!"\par
His mustache twitched as he spoke. He had a booming way about him, quite domineering.\par
But Reina answered him coolly. "We have not forgotten, Admiral. We are very grateful for your help back then. That's why I'm offering you free passage in the Sound."\par
"In exchange for free passage up all the coasts of British Columbia?"\par
"We can act from the north to the south. It's a fair trade." Reina had her chin held high. God she was so pretty when she talked like that. She smiled. "And let's not forget it goes the other way too. Without the Luminous Faction, there would be no Harbormasters either." \par
"Hmph." The Admiral turned back to his ships. "What do you think of our fleet, Miss Torres?"\par
Reina shrugged. "A fine fleet."\par
"More than fine," said Rorke. Spittle flew as he spoke. "I daresay we've got the strongest navy on the West Coast! Perhaps in all the Americas!"\par
Zane wasn't one for politics, but even he could tell the man was trying to wave a big stick. Probably hoping she'd give him better terms. Reina wasn't impressed. \par
Then she blinked. She seemed to notice her mini-map. Then him, standing off to the side. He felt her fierce burst of joy. And then he felt a little undercurrent—she got a gleam in her eye, like she had an idea.\par
She waved at him. "Zane!" She called brightly. She beckoned him closer. He came over, wondering what this was about. Initially he'd just planned on waiting for her to finish.\par
When he got close enough, she grabbed him and kissed him. To his surprise, and the Admirals. When they broke apart, she looked up at him with adoration.\par
"Wow," she breathed. "You're Level 98 now? What happened?"\par
"Cleared a B-rank dungeon," he mumbled.\par
"You must be…top ten in the world now?"\par
He shrugged. "Something like that."\par
Then she blinked and looked back over at the Admiral. "I'm sorry. Where are my manners? This is my partner Zane. Zane, meet the wonderful Admiral Halversen! We're negotiating a deal so we have unrestricted access to each other's trade routes. I think it'll do us both a great deal of good. Don't you?"\par
Suddenly the Admiral seemed a little flustered. "Well—I suppose—by the way, it is a great pleasure to meet you. Yes, a great pleasure—long overdue!" \par
He held out a hand, and Zane shook it firmly.\par
"You were saying something about those ships of yours, Admiral?" said Reina sweetly.\par
"Ah—well—these little things?" He chuckled nervously. He'd gone from booming to squeaking. "Oh—they're nothing much, really..."\par
He watched as Reina proceeded to corner the man into a deal. It was a spectacle to see—she just dominated him verbally. The poor old guy was sweating at the end; it kind of reminded him of what she'd done to Elias. He didn't stand a chance.\par
***\par
As soon as Reina finished up with the Harbormasters, she and Zane went back to kissing. They both seemed to agree that talking could wait—there were better ways to express how much they missed each other. They found the nearest empty beach house. There they went at it.\par
He was always a little surprised how Reina changed around him. She wasn't dominant, like she had been just now; if anything, she was the opposite. She exposed her soft underbelly to him. Something about him seemed to let her relax.\par
They made love for a while. Well—Zane wanted to be tender. But he could sense she wanted him to be more assertive with her. So he was. He tried his best to make her happy.\par
He sensed she was busy taking charge all day. She got worn out by it—with him, sometimes she wanted to let go and just let him take control. She trusted he'd take care of her.\par
After they finished, they lay there in a warm comfy haze. She had her head on his chest. This was Zane's favorite part of the whole thing, usually. This was really nice.\par


\section{101. Show and Tell}
\par
They lay there for who knew how long. Zane was happy just being Reina's pillow, listening as best he could, and being curious. He could tell she was a little pent-up. He wanted to help her vent a little.\par
She started telling him about it. Things were going better actually. The Harbormasters were her main headache—that was squished now. She had no big sudden threats. The Faction was getting to be a well-oiled machine. She had all these measures in place to take care of dungeon breaks, or wars, or petty intra-Faction disputes. She was even training up trusted underlings who could take over for her if need be.\par
"Maybe then I can go with you on one of your adventures," she murmured, looking up at him. She smiled softly. Zane was a little hesitant. He stroked her hair silently. He didn't want to put her in danger. He also didn't think she would approve of the kinds of things he got up to. Like how that last dungeon ended… he'd gloss over some things when he told her the story. For her blood pressure's sake.\par
In the end though, if she wanted to come and they were together, he didn't think it was right to stop her. One of these days, he promised her. And she felt satisfied.\par
She kept updating him about the Faction. Now that things had settled some, not everyone had to be an active duty dungeoneer. Most folk still trained for battle, but a few just weren't cut out for it; some became diplomats or messengers or council members. Some tried picking up crafts.\par
Crafts like smithing. Or alchemy. It was possible—those elixirs had to be made some way. But they'd had scant success. They were still better off buying from the Beacon. The System made it a lot harder to level craft Skills than combat Skills. And you didn't get essence from crafting.\par
"Why do you think that is?" he said.\par
Reina bit her lip. She was frowning a little; he could almost hear the gears in her head start to whir. "It's clearly by design. I don't know, but if I had to guess, the System gives you problems. Dungeons. It wants to incentivize learning Skills that solve those problems. That is, Skills that kill Monsters. I've heard theories that the System is an apocalypse—it's sent to end mankind. I don't buy that… I don't think it's about us. I think it's about Monsters."\par
"Huh." Zane thought about it. "What do you mean?"\par
"Well—" She sat up. She held up a finger. She was getting into lecture mode now.\par
"Monsters don't need dungeons. Monsters want to break out of dungeons. So what does that tell you?"\par
"…Monsters don't like dungeons?"\par
"Exactly." She smiled. "Dungeons and Monsters act in opposition to each other. Dungeons hold Monsters."\par
"Hm."\par
"If you look at it that way, dungeons keep us safe. I first heard Avery say this, and I think she's right. Dungeons are really a prison."\par
She was getting into it. Making hand gestures and everything. She was so pretty when she was being smart.\par
"You said you could feel Monsters souls—they've been corrupted. I think dungeons are a place to hold corrupted souls. We know souls aren't destroyed, only bodies. If you think of it that way, Monster spawning is just another kind of reincarnation."\par
"Huh."\par
She would make a good professor. Zane had never been one for school, but he could've sat there forever just having her teach him things.\par
Her mini-lecture ended, and she slumped back into him.\par
Zane had no clue what to make of all that. "So there'll always be dungeons and Monsters?"\par
"It's not so bad," she murmured, snuggling up to him. Now she was whirring down. She was back in cuddle mode.\par
"Think of it this way," she said sleepily. "If corrupted souls recycle, pure souls do too. So long as there are Monsters, there will be people there to fight them. People like you." And she nuzzled him in the head. Then she paused. "But… that's just a theory."\par
He figured she was probably right. She was usually right about pretty much everything. He just liked hearing her talk.\par
She'd finished rehabilitating most of their Safe Zones now. There wasn't a Legion to go to war with or anything. But somehow she still kept herself busy dawn till dusk—there was always some problem to take care of. She was such a perfectionist.\par
The flipside of that was she always seemed to find some way to stress herself out. Things seemed great around here to Zane, but all she saw were things to fix. She still wanted to revamp their warrior training protocols, recruit more scouts, build up a deep Skill knowledge reservoir, put a fully staffed healing ward in every Safe Zone…\par
Zane wondered if there was a way to make her not-stressed. But Reina was just the kind of person who had to throw herself at big, hard problems, he'd realized. Kind of like how he threw himself at fights. She was born to help people, to lead people out of the dark. She wasn't happy if she didn't do things that made her stressed all the time. It was a bit of a paradox.\par
Zane told her she was brilliant and she was already doing great, and she kind of looked at him side-on. But it was true. He was her number-one fan. He just didn't know how to express it without sounding corny.This narrative has been purloined without the author's approval. Report any appearances on Amazon.\par
***\par
Then they had a bit of a show and tell. After Reina got her Signature Title, her comprehension speed more than tripled. Her big problem was still that she had no time. But she had been working at it the past couple of weeks, and she had two Major Laws to show for it—the Major Law of Living Harmony and the Major Law of Resilient Vitality. Both Wood Laws.\par
She'd only woven one of them into her Signature Skill—the one that let her heal anything, animate or inanimate. But it still made Zane happy to see. She could repair plant-based buildings faster now, which was quite useful given that was most of the Luminous Faction.\par
He gave her his haul—the Vital Bark Pinecone to help with her Law, and the Tome of Deeproot Healing too. With boosted regeneration and super healing powers, she'd be a force to be reckoned with.\par
When she saw them, she let out a little, "Oh, Zane…" And she was kissing him again. She was still up to her neck in work—a little too busy to put all her focus on it. But she said she'd have it learned by the time they went adventuring.\par
***\par
Afterward, they went for a walk down the beach, just watching the waves. There were a few other couples there, a family or two even. It felt strangely like before the change, except for all the weird clothes they all wore. The others stared a little but gave them space.\par
They didn't even need to talk. Just spending time together walking quietly was enough. For Reina, it was more than enough; she hugged his arm and leaned on him as they walked, and she was in bliss.\par
It was kind of surprising—he wasn't even doing anything. But that was precisely it, he'd learned.\par
Reina was usually always 'on'; her mind was always firing. It was what got her all exhausted and stressed all the time. But now she could just turn off and lean on him and take a nice afternoon stroll down the beach. Just turn off and relax. For a while, he'd been baffled why she liked him—she was so smart and used to dealing with all kinds of complex things. He thought she'd get bored of him quickly. But it turned out she actually liked him because she filled the rest of her life with so much complexity. He was like her breath of fresh air.\par
He didn't mind being the simple one. He was just happy he could make her happy.\par
***\par
When they got back, Reina checked the Beacon for messages. It was like checking her e-mail before the change—even on 'off' days she still couldn't go too long without it. She was just too important.\par
She wrinkled her nose when she saw it. Then she turned to him. "It's for you."\par
The message read—\par
Hey there! It's your pal Elias checking in again! Just wanted to congratulate you on clearing that Titansteel dungeon. Great stuff! And hey, you're World Rank 13 too! You know I've always believed in you.\par
You'll be coming up on that dreaded Level 99 bottleneck soon, I'll wager. It just so happens I have the world's best Fire and Steel Caverns of Insight here in SF. They're getting popular. We've got like a quarter of the world's Top 100 down here! But for you, I'll always have a spot reserved.\par
Speaking of—Big news, by the way! I'm hosting a summit! I call it the 'Ventor Global Initiative,' and it'll last all through next week. I'm handing out all kinds of swag. That's Sf-speak for 'treasures,' by the way. You should really pop by and shake some hands.\par
It's getting to be a little festival down here, a real who's who of global powers, you know. Even the World Rankers who didn't come sent ambassadors! Your friend Avery's here too, by the way, just chilling.\par
Here's the kicker. I bought the single best Skill and Level training Dojo in the world. It cost me an arm and a leg to get it, and every use of it costs another arm. But it's so worth it. It's goddamn awesome.\par
It's called the ‘Asura Hell Array.’ It simulates the 9 Layers of Hell. You keep killing demons until you either ‘die’ or go up a layer—but you get real essence for each kill! Which means you can grind a shit-ton of kills at once. Here’s the kicker: every time you kill something with a Skill in there, it gives a shitton more experience than real life. Get up to the sixth layer, and it's like you're Skill Leveling four times as fast! No one's gotten past there yet. But who knows how fast you can level at layer 9?\par
There's a high score, by the way. After Eze broke through to Foundation, he's topped the leaderboard. It's like a measure not just of Level, but also combat effectiveness…maybe you can dethrone him.\par
Some of these World Rank sub-30s are paying me through the nose to use it, and there's a long-ass waiting list! But your pitbull of a girlfriend… I mean this is a compliment, by the way!... squeezed some terms I now regret out of me. So you can use it whenever you like at no extra charge.\par
P.S. Still got those B-ranked treasures with your name on them, just sitting here waiting…\par
P.P.S. If you're curious how you stack up against the World Rank top 10 talent-wise, I also have a device that'll measure it for you. Two devices actually. One for comprehension talent, one for cultivation talent. Seriously, guy. You've gotta come.\par
"He's really trying to sell you on going," said Reina.\par
"Do you think I should?" Zane couldn't lie. It was a pretty sleazy pitch. But still enticing. He liked the sound of that array.\par
She paused. "You're dropping by the area anyway, aren't you?"\par
"Yeah."\par
She looked hesitant. "Elias is a rat," she said. "… but as long as you're not signing anything… as long as you're careful what you agree to—"\par
"Of course."\par
She was quiet for a while, mulling it over. Then—"It could help to stop by. We have a non-aggression pact. And he's right. If it's part of the terms, then you have unrestricted access to whatever resources the Coven has. We should be taking advantage of it. Just… be smart, okay?"\par
Zane nodded.\par
***\par
Zane gave most of the rest of his dungeon haul to her. When they came across those Merchant's Guild credits, the topic of the Merchant's Guild token came up.\par
It was still a bit of a mystery, but Reina did note that one of these Merchant's Guild auctions was coming up next month. You could convert essence stones to auction credits in the Merchant's Guild section of the Beacon. If they saved up essence stones, maybe they could nab something useful for him. Though neither of them was sure how exactly it worked.\par
Finally, Zane gave her the forty high-grade essence stones he'd gotten from the Quest. She gave it some thought.\par
"I was thinking of saving up to buy an A-rank consumable treasure for you," she told him. "With this…" she frowned like she was crunching imaginary numbers. "We could barely afford it. I think it's better we save up for now. Let's see what that Auction has in store."\par
He also wondered if she'd heard anything about those Tomb Kings. They'd just lost one of their strongest fighters—in a dungeon he was in. And if they heard he was in Abyssal Crater when their other top World Ranker died, too… could be some trouble.\par
But Reina said they were quiet. Almost strangely so. The rumor was that Mike Masters, World Rank \#8, was in seclusion right now. Trying to break through the bottleneck like the rest of the top World Rankers.\par
***\par
It was getting late. They were going to go back to their headquarters home, but Zane called for a pit stop by the healing wards. "There's someone I want you to meet."\par

They found Evan in one of the sick rooms—a cozy little thing on the fourth floor with a grand window overlooking the Faction's north side. You could see the fountains spurting up in the town square from here.\par
Evan lay in a little bed. He wasn't alone—there were three nurses there, all giggling. A brunette whispered something in his ear, and he gasped, "Woah! really?" There was more giggling. One of them pinched his cheeks. Another ruffled his hair. He just lay there happily. He was a little confused but he also liked being petted.\par
Zane was speechless. Weren't they supposed to be healthcare professionals? … Should they be doing that?\par
To the side, Reina looked on with an arched brow.\par
The nurses noticed them and broke off blushing. Evan meanwhile perked up.\par
"Zane!" He beamed. He scrambled out of bed, scampered over, and hugged him. Suddenly, Evan felt emotional; he mumbled something heartfelt into Zane's shirt. He was sniffling a little. Zane didn't hear what the boy said, but the feeling behind it was pretty clear. He patted Evan on the head.\par
Then Evan looked up and saw Reina. His eyes went wide. He shuffled behind Zane a little.\par
"This is Reina," Zane explained. "I've told you about her. My girlfriend."\par
Reina's face didn't change, but she felt very happy hearing him say it.\par
"Ohhh!" said Evan. He tugged on Zane's arm and Zane bent over. He got on tiptoes and whispered in his ear, "She's really pretty…"\par
"I know," said Zane.\par
Evan shuffled out from behind him. "Hi! I'm Evan. It's so nice to meet you!"\par
Evan felt nervous. He tended to be around new people, but he was even moreso right now. He felt a little scared. Zane got why. Reina was studying him. She could be intimidating—it was in how she held herself, how she looked. She just looked like a queen. She had a presence to her.\par
Still, Evan put on a smile. He tried not to show it.\par
Reina smiled too. "It's nice to meet you too, Evan. I should thank you. Zane tells me you helped keep him out of trouble in Titansteel."\par
"I did?" Evan blinked. Then he looked at Zane, and Zane gave him a pointed glance.\par
"Oh! Um… uh-huh!" Evan felt quite guilty; lying didn't seem to come easy to him. He tried changing the subject. "Zane talked about you all the time! He said you're really awesome."\par
"Did he, now." This made Reina even happier. She was also a little speechless. "That's… very sweet of him."\par
Zane scratched his head and looked away.\par
"Mhm!" said Evan. "Thanks for letting me sleep in your hospital, by the way! It's so comfy, everything's so big and pretty. And everyone's been so nice to me!"\par
"Yes, well…" Reina frowned at the nurses, who all flinched. But she smiled at Evan. "I'm glad you're enjoying it. We've worked very hard."\par
"She built all this, you know," said Zane proudly.\par
"Well—I wouldn't say that," said Reina hastily. "Lots of people helped."\par
"Reina is super smart," said Zane, nodding. "She gets the job done. You should see the rest of the place."\par
"Wait. Can I?" said Evan, wide-eyed.\par
"Alright," said Reina, flushing. "That's enough." She directed that bit to Zane, though he could tell she liked it. To Evan—"And… sure. We can arrange a tour."\par
Evan was just about to say something, all excited, when his stomach growled. He blushed. "Um. Can we get something to eat?"\par
Reina softened. "Of course we can."\par
***\par
They had a little private dinner at Reina's house, a cozy little cottage a little ways out in the Moon Tree orchards. Reina got some good stuff out of the B-rank Beacon—fancy-looking chowders steaming with essence and a high-grade Dungeness crab dappled with red and blue spices. The meat was sweet and tender and it just dissolved in your mouth.Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\par
Evan started sniffling in the middle of the meal. Reina asked what was wrong.\par
He was in tears. "I—I think—I think this is the tastiest thing I've ever eaten…"\par
Then—"Um. Can I hug you Miss Reina?"\par
Reina was a little surprised. "… Sure?"\par
He waddled over and gave her a hug. Then he waddled back and went back to eating; he gave a little 'ahhhhh.' He was in bliss.\par
Zane often marveled how Evan could squeeze so much joy out of the smallest things. He wondered if you could learn this skill.\par
"So Evan," said Reina. "Zane tells me it's your first time out of Idaho. Is there anyone you'd like us to contact to let them know you're okay? Our Beacon has national coverage."\par
Evan deflated a little. He put down his fork and swallowed. "No…" he mumbled, looking at his feet. "My uncle passed away right after the Change."\par
"Oh! I'm...so sorry."\par
sed."No, it's okay!" said Evan. He gave a little smile. "He died saving me from a Monster. The last thing he told me was that I've got to use my powers to help those who can't help themselves. So I'm going to go around and help as many people as I can!"\par
"That's wonderful..." said Reina softly. She was taking a real liking to him; Zane could feel the warmth in her heart. She felt an urge to mother him. "But you don't have a Faction, Evan. Have you been wandering this whole time?"\par
"Yeah..." He looked sheepish. "I don't really have somewhere to go back to. We were the only people in our Safe Zone."\par
Reina and Zane exchanged a glance.\par
"Well, if you need somewhere to stay," said Reina gently. "You can stay with us."\par
Evan looked stunned. "Really?"\par
"Yes," said Zane.\par
Evan looked to him and then to Reina, then back to him. "Aww geez…" he started tearing up again. He scrambled over and gave Zane a big long hug. Then he gave Reina a big long hug.\par
"You guys are the best!" he sniffled.\par
He went back to finish his crab.\par
***\par
After dinner, they found Evan a place to stay. A quaint little 2nd-floor apartment right around the main square. It was lit in soft warm candlelight; oil lamps dangled from the ceiling under crisscrossing exposed wood beams. A fire murmured in a hearth. A plush wool rug ran the length of the wood floor, ending at a four-poster bed draped in soft furs.\par
It was supposed to be a temporary place until they found something bigger. But Evan fell in love with the place instantly—he gasped as soon as he saw it. He kept gasping as he went around exploring. Then he sank into the bed and disappeared into it. He was just gone.\par
"I love it!" squeaked his voice from somewhere in the furs. They left him there and agreed to meet up the next morning for breakfast.\par
***\par
Zane and Reina went off to do their own thing.\par
The night passed. Zane went to pick up Evan the next morning. The first thing Evan asked was, "Where's Miss Reina?"\par
Zane winced. "She's still sleeping."\par
"Oh. Okay!"\par
He was glad Evan didn't ask for details.\par
You had to be careful with this kind of dual cultivation. Essence gains were based on the intensity of the pleasure. He… may have overdone it a little. She'd asked him to—quite loudly in the moment—but he still felt kind of bad. On the bright side, she got two Levels out of it.\par
Evan was pretty much ready to go right away. He seemed to have a similar thing to Zane—for him, he just wanted to adventure and go on quests and help people. Do hero things. For Zane, he wanted to fight things. Different motivations but they ended up in a similar place.\par
The Pacific Northwest was pretty cleared by now. Zane had checked the Beacon map. He was mainly eyeing an A-ranked dungeon down in Los Angeles now. It was the highest-ranked dungeon on the West Coast.\par
Evan, meanwhile, still had a bone to pick with those Tomb Kings, who he thought were just the worst bullies. They decided pretty quick they'd go together. Or rather, Evan said, "Can I go with you? Please?" And Zane didn't have the heart to say no.\par
***\par
Before they left, they got a message from Avery.\par
I'm bored. \par
What's taking you so long, you big goof? It's so crowded—I swear everyone's a World Ranker! I used to think I was special. \par
At least the food here's really good. And their water Cavern of Insight is like SeaWorld on steroids, so that's been fun. But the line's gotten so long I can't even get a timeslot nowadays. So I'm just walking around bumming food off Elias. Did you know you can make scones that are consumable C-rank treasures? I'm eating like a dozen of them a day, it's great!\par
Oh there's some cool people I want to show you! There's this one guy who's kind of like you. A lunk, I mean. But he has even less of a life than you, if you can believe it! Jk. Kind of. That dude just eats, breathes, and sleeps training. We spar sometimes and it's funny watching him get mad 'cause he can't beat me up. He's like stupid competitive. He one-bangs literally everyone else but I'm just too good I guess ¯_(ツ)_/¯\par
Did I mention I learned some new tricks?\par
Anyway, you better come soon or I'm gonna assume you're just trying to avoid an ass whooping! ( ๑‾̀◡‾́)σ"\par
"Who's that?" said Evan.\par
Zane thought about how best to explain Avery and gave up. "She's… you'll see."\par
***\par
Reina came to around noon. She badly wanted to go with him. But in the end they both knew she was too important. For now, she had to stay here. He promised he'd be back soon.\par
They had one last goodbye kiss.\par
He made sure he had all his Law treasures on him. All those Law Fruit, plus those Titansteel Tree Leaves, and that Worldseed he'd gotten, and even that one recording of that Steelheart Conclave Elder's punch—he still had a play left of that. And he'd get to use Elias's super-Caverns of Insight.\par
Maybe it was overconfident. But to him, it wasn't a matter of if he'd break through. It was a matter of how fast.\par
Then he and Evan set off for San Francisco.\par


\section{103. Arrival}
\par
First Zane and Evan teleported to Titansteel. From there they went on foot.\par
Before they set off Zane gave Evan the Titansteel Breastplate. He slid it right over Evan's tunic—it was a little big at first, but it shrank to fit him. Evan was delighted; he kept staring at it, rapping it, listening to the little clink-clink sounds it made. He almost ran into a tree.\par
Neither of them wore status blockers now. With how strong they were, there was nothing to be concerned about. And with how strong the Luminous Faction was, it didn't matter if people knew Zane wasn't home. Nobody was threatening them anyway. It was Reina's idea—showing their strength might make the going easier.\par
The trees around these parts were still huge. They passed through a few forest dungeons full of giant, needle-leafed trees. Nothing quite as big as Titansteel. Or anywhere close to as time-consuming. They split up to wipe the Bosses. Evan came in very useful; he was so fast he could run through a D-rank dungeon in half an hour.\par
Soon they were getting out of the wilderness and into conquered territory. Most of the way to San Francisco was split up between a few regional powers.\par
They ran into their first as they neared the Northern Californian coast.\par
A blanket of soft mist curled around their ankles, stretching into the distance, shrouding the line where the baby-blue sky met the turquoise sea. The waters around here were pure and shockingly vivid; they glistened with sunlight, a brilliant expanse stretching as far as the eye could see, lapping at stretches of pastel yellow beach. They heard the soft crashing of those foaming waves, felt the salty tang of ocean spray drifting on cool air. Dramatic cliffs watched over it all, cloaked in low-hanging mists.\par
In those fighting games Zane used to play to unwind after work, your character could get paralyzed by a spell. You just stood there unable to move. The moment Evan caught sight of the place his mouth hung open. He was stun-locked.\par
He stood there for a full minute just staring. Zane had to drag him away.\par
They went down to the beach and walked along the sandy strip; they sank down almost to their ankles with each step. This Safe Zone belonged to the 'Lost Coast Faction,' apparently. He could see watchtowers poking out of the cliff face. The mini-map showed hidden coves scattered here and there.\par
Then there was a mass of white—a small army marching out to meet them. They brandished staffs and swords—all pointed quite menacingly at Zane and Evan. Rangers poked out of those watchtowers, bows nocked and drawn.\par
A rugged-looking warrior came out to greet them. "Identify yourselves! State your names and purpose!" he hollered.\par
He was a bit too far out to identify directly with the implicit Skill. But he was marching closer.\par
Zane cleared his throat. "I am Zane Walker. This is Evan Armstrong. We're just passing through."\par
This drew a wave of disbelief.\par
"Yeah right," snorted the warrior. "And I'm Irina Volkova!"\par
Then he got close enough to Identify them properly. And frowned, and squinted, and then went quite pale.\par
Then there was a lot of apologizing. He got very polite all of a sudden. They ended up putting all their weapons away and letting them pass without a fuss.\par
Turned out Reina was right.\par
Zane and Evan kept going, and it was like they were celebrities passing through. Zane kept being surprised how everyone knew who he was, even down here. They knew who Evan was too. It kind of made sense. The World Rankings were visible to every Faction; and since everyone had to be a fighter now, they kept tabs on the field. They knew who the elites were.\par
There was lots of gossip being passed, Zane knew. He didn't participate much, but even he heard occasional chatterings about Jian Shi Ming solo-clearing a B-rank dungeon, or Cain Hastings losing a duel to Irina Volkova. That kind of thing.\par
Soon they passed out from under the beaches and the cliffs. The next Faction they came across was called 'Giant's Grotto.' It and its sub-Factions covered a huge swath of land, stretching almost to Sacramento. Most of it was underground, interestingly, though it seemed at first like just another forest dungeon. A vast tunnel system linked the Faction, winding through the tree roots.\par
As they passed, Rangers and Warriors, mostly wood- and earth- specialists, poked out to watch. They were less aggressive than that other Faction. Moreso wary and awed, like they were seeing mythical beasts migrating through their forest. Their leader rushed out to greet them—a wiry old man with a wispy beard that went down to his waist. Stammering, smiling and sweating, he invited them to dinner. Evan almost accepted out of politeness, but Zane cut him off. They still had a lot of ways to go.\par
As they went, the trees started to shrink. They passed a Faction that looked like the Luminous Forest. Except the trees were spread out over a mountain range; glowing wisps lit the air. There was a witchy, mystical energy to the place. It was mostly Rogues and Mages here. Light- and wood- specialists, and they were also pretty chill. Evan was a big fan of their cloak designs—they were light and loose and looked spun out of moonlight.This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road. If you spot it on Amazon, please report it.\par
By then half the day had passed, and they stopped for food.\par
Reina had packed Zane the newly upgraded Moon Fruit. He recalled mentioning off-handedly during one of their long walks a few weeks ago about wanting to try some of the fresh crop once it came ripe. Of course she remembered.\par
Evan, meanwhile, got more Dungeness crab, which just about made his day. Reina was becoming one of his favorite people.\par
They moved on.\par
The last Faction they came across used to be Napa Valley, Zane guessed. By then, the terrain had leveled out mostly. The big trees were gone. It was just lush valleys and rolling bright green hills. Lots of fat juicy fruit growing everywhere. The Faction guarding it called themselves the Vintner Knights. The Knights' leader was a ruddy-cheeked, potbellied guy, bald and friendly. Zane wasn't sure if it was just the Northern California spirit or something. But they were having pretty good luck with nice Factions, and this one was no different.\par
Or maybe they were just scared, hard to tell.\par
Then they were getting into the outskirts of San Francisco. They arrived at the first Silicon Coven Safe Zone around mid-afternoon. The design here was totally different from the other Factions. No wood or dirt or stone anymore; it was all steel and glass buildings, very sleek, very minimal. But they weren't like skyscrapers. They seemed more like wizards' towers. They cropped up all over the place. They were just blanketed in glowing runes, more complex than any Zane had ever seen.\par
There were weird steel totems poking out of the ground too—they also shimmered with runes. And a few weird circles of steel lay about like summoning-circles. He and Evan faced no standing army, no resistance, no walls, not even guards—they just walked on in. Folk stared as they passed.\par
The folk here were even dressed oddly. They wore twinkling silver robes embroidered with the sun and moon insignia. They looked sleek and streamlined, a cross between a business suit and something Gandalf might wear.\par
Then a thin, slick-haired man soon came out to greet them. He wore the same robes, as well as glasses with no lenses—just rims.\par
Jimmy Draper \par
Essence Level 53 \par
Class: Light Archmage \par
Faction: Silicon Coven.\par
The man smiled brightly. "Hey there! You guys here for VGI?"\par
"VGI?" said Evan.\par
"That's short for Ventor Global Initiative."\par
"We're going there. Yes," said Zane.\par
"Great! I'm Jimmy. I'm one of the VIP ushers—I got an alert as soon as you guys came. See that?”\par
He pointed out into the distance. This Safe Zone ended on a beach—across that beach, across what Zane guessed used to be the San Francisco Bay, was a sprawling shining city of steel and glass, with tufts of greenery poking out in between. It looked a lot like this Safe Zone, except the spires went a lot higher.\par
"That's main Campus! That's what we call our Headquarters, by the way—where everything's going down. You can't miss it. Cross the Golden Gate and our staff will meet you on the other side. As top World Rankers and thus VIPs, you guys get free entry to everything except for the Asura Hell Array. Welcome, and enjoy your stay!"\par
"Thank you!" said Evan.\par
They kept going. "That guy was really nice," said Evan. Evan liked the place already. Though he tended to like most things he came across.\par
"Be careful," said Zane.\par
"What do you mean?"\par
"If someone offers you a deal or a contract, do not take it. If someone offers you anything, do not go with them. Come to me. I will handle it."\par
"Oh!” Evan blinked. “Okay.”\par
They came to the Golden Gate Bridge, and Evan got stun-locked again.\par
It was cast out of pure gold now, an absolute behemoth of precious metal. Massive, complex runes ran over its many cables, stretching up to its many skyscraper towers. It was like a bridge built for giants. A light fog shrouded the ground.\par
Zane supposed it looked pretty cool, but Evan's brain was struggling to unscramble itself. This boy's experience of the world was really something.\par
They saw sparks like fireworks flashing in the sky above the headquarters as they passed over it.\par
There were tables set up on the other side. A smartly dressed woman greeted them with a perfect smile. She was also a Mage class. Almost everyone in this Coven seemed to be.\par
"Welcome! May I have your—ohh! Zane Walker! One moment please."\par
She got out a crystal, whispered into it, and nodded.\par
"What?" said Zane warily.\par
"Our Grand Warlock has requested we let him know as soon as you came—he wants—"\par
Then a map of black opened up in front of them. An outstretched Elias Ventor, a too-white smile on his face. He flashed shark-like teeth. "Zane Walker, my favorite berserker! It's been far, far too long. How are we?"\par
Zane shrugged.\par
"Your girlfriend's not with you?"\par
"She's too busy."\par
He noted how relieved Elias felt at that. “Ah! How unfortunate. In any case—this is a funny coincidence. I was just talking about you with some of the other top Rankers! I’m holding a gala tonight, see. It'll have essence wine tasting. We’ve got a bottle of some B-plus ranked wine, vintage alien stuff. You’ve got to come—"\par
"No," said Zane. "I'm not doing any of these… whatever. I will use your things. That's it."\par
"Of course, of course.” Elias nodded along. "Straight to the point, I see! I can respect that. And who’s this little guy? Ah, yes! Evan Armstrong." Elias's smile widened. "World Rank \#14! It's an honor, truly. My name is Elias, Elias Ventor. Owner and proprietor of this humble Faction. Say, how’d you like—"\par
"He's with me," said Zane. "He's off limits."\par
"Yup!" said Evan, nodding enthusiastically. "I'm off limits!" He had no clue what was going on.\par
"Very well, very well…" Elias sighed. He smiled sardonically. “I get the message. You'll forgive me for trying. Well, I just dropped by to say hello. Megan here will take care of your housing, and food, let you know where all the best attractions are—the works. You'll want to check out the Stellar Steel Crater. And the Martial Hell Asura, of course! But yes, yes. You can take care of yourself. I’ll get out of your hair. It was nice seeing you again, Zane! And I mean that sincerely. You’re getting to be one of my star investments—and how you’ve grown! You may… well, let’s be honest, eh? You may despise me, and trust me—I get it. But just know I am rooting for you. Out of self-interest, perhaps. But I am.”\par
He winked. Then paused. "Before I go, though…"\par
Like a magic trick, two treasures appeared in his hands. One was a crystal. The other was a stone tablet engraved with mysterious symbols.\par
“How’d you like to know how your talent stacks up against the best in the world?"\par


\section{104. Talent}
\par
"So? Want to give it a try?"\par
Zane just frowned at him. Elias rolled his eyes. "It's not a trick question. Yeesh." Zane could feel he was telling the truth.\par
"Here." Elias held out the crystal. "Let me show you."\par
Once he grasped it firmly, a little scale flickered up in front of it—a wispy illusion. It looked like a thermometer. At its bottom, there was a display. It read, "F0."\par
"All the crystal does is circulate a little pure essence through you. It's like taking in a normal vial of essence, except it goes all the way through and back! It tests how much your body absorbs. Starting now…"\par
The crystal started to glow. At the same time, a pure white light shot up from the bottom of the scale. It passed 1, then 2, 3, and 4 in quick succession. The display reflected it—F1, F2, F3, F4.\par
When it hit the top—10—it broke the top of the scale. And reset. The new display at the bottom read, "E0." The light kept shooting up.\par
"This thing cost me a minor fortune, you know. Not sure why it's calibrated so low, though," said Elias. The scale kept shooting up. It hit 10 again, then reset—D0 was the next grade.\par
"Nobody I've tested, even your average Joe off the street, gets less than a 'C0' on this thing. Anyway—it's coming up now…"\par
Past C, Past B—at A the scale finally started to slow. "A's the highest grade, by the way," said Elias. "Here it comes!"\par
The light hit '8'. And halted there. The display at the bottom shone bright.\par
Cultivation Talent determined \par
A8\par
"That's me!" said Elias cheerfully. "Not too shabby, if I do say so myself. And now for comprehension."\par
He picked up the tablet, and a similar thing happened. A little scale popped up with a display. Except this time, the picture on the tablet shifted—it called out to the soul. It felt like a Skill tome or a Law recording; there was a vision hidden in there. Elias closed his eyes. His brow furrowed in concentration.\par
The gauge started shooting up, broke past the top, reset. F…E…D…\par
About half a minute later—\par
Comprehension talent determined!\par
A7\par
"There we are!" crowed Elias. "That puts me roughly about… oh, one in a few million for soul talent? And one in a few tens of millions for cultivation talent! Pretty solid, I'd say. Around average for the Rank-20 to 30 range. Just having double A-ranks—even A0's—puts you in World Ranker territory."\par
"Ooh!" gasped Evan. "Can I try?"\par
"You sure can!" said Elias.\par
Zane didn't feel any sinister intent coming from the man—it did seem to be just a talent gauge. He frowned, but he didn't stop Evan. The boy ambled forward and put his hand on the crystal.\par
It shot up fast, even faster than Elias' had. Soon it breached A-grade. It just kept climbing. It didn't start slowing until it got past A7. Then A8… A9….\par
It settled at the very top of the scale.\par
Cultivation Talent determined!\par
A10\par
"Sheesh, kid!" cried Elias. "You know how many A10s I've tested? Two! And they're both Top 7 in the world."\par
Evan beamed.\par
Next up was soul talent. This one also shot up pretty fast. Slower than cultivation talent though. When it stopped the display read:\par
Comprehension talent determined!\par
A8\par
"Whew." Elias shook his head. "Nuts. Just nuts. We'll see you in the Top Ten pretty damn soon, I expect."\par
He eyed Evan with new interest. "Although…if you want to get there sooner rather than later, maybe we can help each other out. Say, how'd you like to—"\par
"He doesn't," said Zane firmly. Almost in a growl.\par
"I don't!" said Evan cheerfully. "I trust Zane. Whatever he says goes."\par
And Elias held up his hands, grinning helplessly. "Alright, alright… and how about you, Zane? With how fast you're growing, I'm sure you'd do very well. The highest guy I've tested is Eze—straight 10s. A10 cultivation, A10 comprehension. Same with Yui Urabe, Japan's \#1—World Rank six or seven right now? I'd guess every one of them—Dos Santos, Hastings, Land, Shi-Ming, Hall, Volkova, Walker—all perfect double-10's. They're the only one's who've broken the bottleneck, by the way…"\par
He paused, then gave Zane a little side-eye. He was feeling a little mischievous. "That's the other Walker I'm talking about. Jason Walker. Ranked four right now. Zane Walker, Jason Walker, and you're both top Rankers… something tells me that's not a coincidence. You're related, aren't you? A cousin of yours?"\par
Zane stiffened. "Brother," he said coldly.\par
"Ah. Well, I haven't tested him personally, but a little birdie confirmed he tested perfect too. How'd you like to know how you measure up?"\par
Zane knew he was being baited. Even so—"Fine."\par
"Excellent!" Elias handed him the talent crystal, and he grasped it firmly.Unauthorized duplication: this tale has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\par
He felt a tingly string of essence trickle through the base of his palm. From there it cycled through him...\par
Up shot the meter—past C, past B, past A… Once it hit A4, it started to slow.\par
Elias frowned. It hit A5, and it was struggling now. It hit A6, climbed a little farther, and came to a rest somewhere between A6 and A7.\par
Cultivation Talent determined! \par
A6\par
"…Ah," said Elias. "Hm. Hmm." Zane sensed his disappointment. Elias thought it'd be higher. "Well," he said at last. "I suppose that's a testament to your hard work, eh? Keep it up! A6 is still nothing to sneeze at. Still one in a million!"\par
But Zane could feel that Elias just lost a lot of interest in him. "Good call on skipping the Gala tonight, by the way." Elias winked. "It's not your scene anyway."\par
Zane's main feeling about it was, eh. All it meant was that it'd take more essence for him to Level than the elites of the world. Essence requirements only ramped up with Levels. He'd have to work that much harder to keep up. Oh, well. \par
He wasn't very invested in hitting any particular World Rank anyway. It just kind of happened. As long as he grew fast enough to keep having fun fights, he didn't care much either way.\par
It wasn't surprising to him he was less talented than Jason. It was a little disappointing, sure, but that was how it'd always been between them.\par
"Well," sighed Elias. "What do you say we check your Comprehension, eh? Just to finish things off."\par
He brought out the stone tablet, and Zane focused on it. The squiggly carved lines on it started to shuffle; it settled. They started suggesting a picture to him. The more Zane stared at it, the clearer the picture got. The tablet called out to his soul. And Zane slipped into it with ease.\par
It was a simple vision. Just a bald man in loose monk's robes throwing a punch. ...That was it.\par
Zane got it. He was a little confused—what else was he meant to comprehend? It just seemed a simple punch to him.\par
The scene faded away, and he was left blinking at the real world again. What had that been--five seconds? Less? He saw the gauge shooting up. It was at C, then B, then A.\par
It hit A4, then A5, and A6—it still wasn't stopping. A7… A8… A9…\par
"Goddamn!" said Elias. It hit A10. "Best in class!" His interest in Zane just shot back up. He was grinning again. "Oh, forget that A6. For combat strength, Comprehension's much more important. Dude, this is great news! If you just—"\par
He frowned. The light was still going. It went past the midpoint of 10 before it started to slow. Then it hit the end.\par
And the light fizzled out. The whole meter blanked out. Elias frowned at it.\par
Then something new popped up on the display at the bottom.\par
Comprehension Talent lies beyond measurable bounds\par
Placeholder grade: S\par
No number next to it. Just S. They all stared at it in silence.\par
"Huh," said Elias at last. "That's… never happened before. I didn't know that was possible, actually. …What the fuck?"\par
He gave Zane a curious look. "Say. How many Major Laws do you have again?"\par
Zane wasn't even sure. "Eight?"\par
"Shit!" There was a new light in his eyes as he looked at Zane again. "I'll be damned! Zane Walker. Well, well. What do you know? I always believed you were special. Always!"\par
"Right."\par
Elias rubbed his hands giddily. "Yes… about that Gala—you sure you don't wanna come? Each sip of one of those alien wines is like taking in a B-grade Vial of Elixir—hell, you can be the Guest of Honor!"\par
"I'm good," said Zane flatly.\par
"Suit yourself," chuckled Elias. He was getting ideas—ideas that were getting him very excited. "Oh—and once you get your housing, I'll have those B-rank treasures I owe you delivered. You know what? I'll even throw in an A-rank Vial of Essence, free of charge. Damn! When you learned Rising Sun Slash that fast… I should've known. Should've known!"\par
"I'm not signing anything," Zane said, eyes narrowed.\par
“Oh, please. It's not like that. It's a gift!" Elias raised a finger, grinning too-white teeth. "It's an investment, rather. This Comprehension of yours… this changes everything. See, once you get a couple of Legendary Skills under your belt—or heavens, a couple Elemental Laws… well! You'll make much better use of the essence than the other rubes I've signed. You could be clearing A-rank dungeons in months. Maybe S-ranks! I'm not putting fuel into a Prius when I could be putting it into a Lambo—you get my drift?"\par
“…”\par
"So your Level grows slower. But when we factor in Law and Skill growth, your combat strength growth… now that's a different matter altogether, isn't it?"\par
"…"\par
"We don't need to get into the essence math. But trust me. When you're clearing elite dungeons, you'll pay me back soon enough. I'll be watching. Do well, and you can expect more 'performance bonuses,' shall we call them? I expect great things from you, Zane Walker. Great things!"\par
He snapped his fingers, and a black maw of a portal opened up behind him. Still chuckling, he stepped on through; he was gone.\par
***\par
The lady at the front desk—who looked pretty frazzled now—gave Evan and Zane a wristband treasure. It was the standard issue kind of the Beacon made—it made them 'guests' of the Silicon Coven. Their wristbands were gold for VIPs. It let them use all the special Dojos and Law treasure areas and cultivation centers—really everything pretty much, for free. Except that Asura Hell Array thing, the lady said. That they still had to pay for. The rate was 20 high-grade essence stones per use. Because of his soul contract, for Zane, it was at cost—5 high-grade essence stones per use.\par
Some of the Dojos, especially the popular ones, were booked up days in advance. But Zane's contract meant they were also obligated to hold a free slot open for him.\par
…God. Reina was just great.\par
The wristband would also let them access their rooms. As World Rankers, they got suites in the highest of those spires--a hotel called 'Minas Tirith' with 24/7 catering. All food had the equivalent essence to a B-grade treasure.\par
They also got a pamphlet with an event schedule on it. There were events every day—things like 'Zen Garden Meditation' in the mornings, in some special garden that was apparently so chock-full of essence just breathing in the air could help Level you up. There was\par
'Master Class: Elemental Wind,' taught by\par
'World Rank \#6 Yui Urabe' at noon. Or 'Panel Discussion: Balancing Power and Responsibility' with\par
Keynote speakers:\par
World Rank \#12 Somsak Srisuwan—Leader, Bangkok Top Team\par
World Rank \#9 Cain Hastings—Leader, Knights Templar\par
World Rank \#17 Isabella DiAngelo—Leader, Nova Roma.\par
Zane wasn't particularly interested in any of them. The first thing he wanted to do was scout out that Steel treasure area. It was supposed to be an A-rank Treasure Area, wasn't it? Then he'd take a nap or something—he was almost fully recovered by now, soul-wise. Tomorrow morning, he figured, he'd make his big push there.\par
After that, maybe that Hell Simulator thing could be interesting…\par
He stilled.\par
He felt something coming up behind him. Something sneaky, with bad intentions. It was preparing to strike—\par
He whirled around, fist raised.\par
And Avery shrieked. She flailed and fell on her ass. Then she pouted at him. “Dangit! How'd you know I was coming?”\par
“…”\par
“Pfft." She blew a strand of hair out of her face and grinned. “…Anyway. Hey hey, long time no see! How've you been, you big lunk?"\par
"Good."\par
"Mm. Me too. Better than good, actually. I've been great. Man, I've got so much to show you—"\par
At that point, Evan emerged from behind him. And Avery gasped. She was feeling something like—awwww what a cute puppy!\par
"Oooooh!" she said. She came up close and inspected him, squinting, and Evan blinked.\par
She looked up at Zane. "Where'd you get him? Can he talk? Does he do tricks?"\par
She winked back at Evan. "Just kidding."\par
Evan was quite confused.\par
"Hi!" said Avery brightly. She held out a hand. "I'm Avery."\par
“I’m Evan!” said Evan.\par
She turned back to Zane. "Can I have him?"\par
"...Sure?"\par
“Awesome." Her grin turned mischievous. To Evan—"You're coming with me. I'm gonna give you a makeover. How's that sound?"\par
Zane sensed she wanted to take Evan under her wing, kind of like he'd done—something about Evan made people want to take care of him.\par
Evan still wasn’t sure what was going on, but he just went with it. “Okay!”\par
She looped an arm over the boy's shoulder. "Alright!"\par
To Zane—"You go get settled, check out the place. I'll give him back around dinner—there's a grill going on in Golden Park. How 'bout we catch up there?"\par
Zane shrugged.\par
"Seeya then!" She dragged Evan off.\par
"…"\par
What just happened?\par


\section{105. Scouting Out}
\par
Zane was a little concerned as he watched them go, but... eh. Evan would be fine. Avery was a little... much... but she meant well.\par
***\par
The mid-afternoon sun told him he still had a few hours before dinner. So he went to get settled. He walked down a main avenue lined with runed stone pillars. Banners hung off the top of them, printed with the faces of a bunch of World Rankers attending the event—some serious, some smiling. Little flags dotted the corners; there were a lot of countries here.\par
Most of the attendees weren't World Rankers though. Most seemed to be what Zane would consider 'upper-middle class' strength-wise. 50s, 60s, some 70s. They were dressed in all kinds of stuff—flowy robes, tight robes, cloth tunics, artsy smocks, hard-boiled jerkins, suits of armor, even—no two seemed the same. At a glance, he must have caught the names of a dozen or two different Factions. He caught a fair few stares as he passed.\par
Brightly colored wood stalls cropped up here and there; he saw one selling Skill Tomes, another armor plates. He saw a food market down a branching path where a middle-aged man was touting burning fruit big as a human head. There were mangoes crackling lightning on display.\par
He passed a gathering in a little open-air amphitheater—a Signed woman on a dais was speaking, gesturing intensely. A banner above her read 'Lecture on the Elemental Law of Darkness, by World Rank \#19, Tracy Cortez.' "—the core of the matter. Darkness is not merely the absence of light! It is a force in its own right—"\par
He kept moving. The hotel was up ahead, a gleaming spire of glass and steel where they'd given him a very fancy room. The pamphlet pointed out if he took a little detour down this curved side path, he'd come across an A-rank Steel treasure area.\par
He took the detour.\par
It was a crater with a meteor in the middle. A pure black meteor, so black it had no visible features—a 2D hole cut in the 3D world. No light came off it to give it depth. It streamed with dense Laws that buffeted him like invisible winds. They struck at the body and the soul.\par
Stellar Steel Crater\par
This crater was formed when a chunk of Spirit Steel birthed in the heart of a star was dislodged and fell into planetary orbit. It has been relocated here by the System; within lie crucial insights into the Elemental Law of Steel, preserved at ultra-high density.\par
The crater itself was split into rings. The outer rings were laced with veins that glowed a soft silver. Tiny metallic flakes floated about like a snowfall suspended, pouring Elemental steel into the world.\par
The silver veins grew thicker, pulsed brighter as you got to the middle ring. The ground took on a metallic sheen. Strange silver plants curled between the rocks.\par
The innermost ring was splashed with a steely gloss. And the air around the meteor itself bent and warbled. Little auroras of light traced the meteor's surface.\par
A hefty crowd had gathered around already. Almost all of them were scattered in the outer ring. They were decently high Level, sixties, 70s. Maybe a few World Rankers there. He saw all kinds of Factions—' the Gold Belt Gladiators,' 'the Wolves of Baja,' 'Nova Roma,' 'Chengdu Fireballs,'—the Harbourmasters, even.\par
Almost all of them were still. Their eyes were squeezed shut, some trembled.\par
Curious, Zane strode closer. The pressure grew stronger, denser, an oppressive humidity; the waves of Elemental Steel washed all over him, buffeting him, dragging at him. He walked past a clump of folk—they were physically still, but their souls were brimming with activity. They had to fight just to stay in place.\par
But Zane had felt Elemental Steel before. And though this was by far the densest concentration of it he'd ever felt, it wasn't enough to slow him. As those thick Steel Laws poured over him, his own held them off; they broke against his skin, washed right over him. He took step after step, striding past more sweating, red-faced people.\par
By the time he stepped into the middle ring, he was starting to slow. It felt like he was stepping into some giant forge. He wasn't sure what grade that Spirit Steel was, but it was like nothing he'd ever seen. He didn't know you could put that much Law in that small a space. He got a strange impression—like he was feeling a shadow of what steel felt at the heart of a star. He gritted his teeth and pushed on.\par
He stopped at the line where the second ring met the first. And there his veins stood out purple on his skin; his jaw clenched tight; every muscle in his body strained against the flow. There was no need, physically—it was just an involuntary reaction to the force crushing down on his soul.Unauthorized duplication: this narrative has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\par
He nodded. He took a step back. This was as far as he was willing to go for now. This was just a scouting trip. Tomorrow morning, when he was fully recovered, he'd try this again. And he wasn't stopping until he got a hand on that stone.\par
"Soon," he murmured. He smiled. He couldn't wait.\par
As he turned to leave, he noticed most of the crowd had stopped meditating. They were looking up at him, wide-eyed. Whispering in hushed tones. Looking around, he could tell why—he was the only one within thirty feet of the first ring.\par
He started walking back.\par
He heard his name a few times as he passed, and his Title—\par
"That's the Savage Sage!"\par
"I didn't know he'd come in!"\par
"He just arrived—my friend works concessions, he sent me a message. He saw the Sage and the Grand Warlock talking on the bridge!"\par
"Woah…"\par
"Do you think he'll give a lecture on the Law? I didn't see his name on the event list…"\par
"What do you think he'll get on the Asura Hell array? I bet third."\par
"Better than Cain Hastings?! No way…"\par
On and on it went. He tuned it out and moved on.\par
***\par
As he looped back, he noticed another treasure area en route to the hotel. The other thing that caught his attention.\par
This 'Asura Hell Array.' He saw it coming a ways off. There was a pretty big crowd bunched around it, murmuring, shuffling in nervous anticipation. The Array itself was a broad steel loop engraved with brilliant runes; a small atmosphere of essence poured off of it. In the middle swirled a psychedelic blend of purples and blues. Some kind of portal?\par
Guards in sleek Silicon Coven garb sealed off the entrance.\par
"Stand clear!" shouted one of them, brandishing a staff cackling with lightning. "Coming through. Give him space!"\par
Zane noticed a massive stone tablet right next to the portal. There were names marked off the top, stretching down. The first three---\par
\par
CAIN HASTINGS, 382 KILLS\par
YUI URABE, 550 KILLS\par
EMEKA EZE, 642 KILLS\par
\par
Just then the number next to Eze's name started to shift. It updated—685 KILLS.\par
Gasps rang out from the crowd.\par
Then a man stepped out of the portal. A giant, well-built, strongly featured wall of a man. About as big as Zane. He wore a deep purple tunic, embroidered gold.\par
Zane could instantly feel something different about him. It was the same as with the Treant. An aura streamed off him like light shines off a star. An aura of Elemental Law. Not one Zane was familiar with. The man walked by, and the crowd parted before him like peasants before a king. He didn't look to either side as he passed; he acknowledged no one. It wasn't even disdain—just that no one interested him. They didn't even register, the way ants didn't register as you stepped over them.\par
Emeka Eze\par
Essence Level 110\par
Signature Title: Touch of Death\par
Class: Earthbound Titan\par
Faction: Lords of Zuma\par
Zane sucked in a breath. So this was the Number 3 in the world, huh.\par
He had a bad habit. His first thought when he saw someone strong was usually—I wonder what it'd be like to fight him.\par
The thought hit him now.\par
It excited him.\par
It was as though Eze heard what he was thinking—he glanced over. They locked eyes—and Eze frowned.\par
Then Zane felt a burst of noise in Sage Mind. A blast of meaningless feeling like television static for the soul.\par
Everyone else's feelings came in clear. But Eze's felt scrambled somehow. It hurt his head just taking it all in.\par
He thought at first the man was doing something funny. But Eze also seemed confused. Zane couldn't tell by his feelings anymore. Just by the look on his face.\par
The static faded as fast as it'd come. What was that?\par
Now everyone was staring at them. Two of the strongest beings in the world, in one place, locking eyes. A nervous tension hung over the crowd; Zane could feel them holding their breaths.\par
Then Eze opened his mouth.\par
"Zane Walker," he said slowly. Each word came out smoothly, carefully, very measured. Carefully enunciated, with a trace of an accent. "The little water demon has told me of you."\par
Zane blinked. "What?"\par
"Avery Lively."\par
"…Ah."\par
"She said your powers are dangerous and unusual. I...see that now."\par
Zane shrugged, and for a moment Eze was silent, considering him. Then a hint of a smile came on his face. "You wish to fight me."\par
Zane was surprised—how could he tell? Then the man tapped a fist to his heart. "I see it in your eyes. I understand. I am the same way."\par
Now that the static had died down, Eze's feelings came through clear again. Like a low hearth burning—he was speaking honestly, from the heart. He knew what it felt too; the whole time they spoke, his soul was kept at a low burn. Ready to flare.\par
"After you break through the bottleneck, seek me out. I will give you your fight then."\par
He stepped closer, held out a hand.\par
And Zane shook it firmly. For some reason he couldn't place, he found himself smiling a little too.\par
Eze's expression turned wistful. He felt strangely hopeful. "It is rare that I meet someone interesting," he mused. "Please… do not disappoint me."\par
Then he turned, nodded, and strode away. Zane watched him go.\par
Well that was weird.\par
What was that static? It didn't feel like his Sage Mind was blocked. More like… there was some other Skill Eze was using on him. And when they both used their Skills at the same time, they scrambled each other. Weird. He was pretty sure it wasn't another Skill like Sage Mind—he would've felt it.\par
Instead, it felt like he was getting dozens of different emotions at once, all a little unreal. Ghostly flickers of feeling.\par
Zane shrugged and went off himself.\par
***\par
Once he got to the 'Minas Tirith' hotel, a friendly mustached concierge checked him into the penthouse suite—"courtesy of Mr. Ventor, sir." There he found a room a little too rich for his taste, lots of gold and fluffy stuff everywhere. Along with a B-grade Vial of Essence and the B-grade Law Fruit.\par
The treasure he pocketed, the essence he drank. It took him halfway to Level 99.\par
Time for dinner with Avery and Evan. Then sleep.\par
And then, at last, his breakthrough.\par


\section{106. Breakthrough (I) }
\par
\par
Zane was to meet Evan and Avery in the 'Golden Garden.' It was named for the little gold-petaled flowers peppering its grounds, swaying gently in the breeze. It stood on top of a hill. From here you could see most of the Silicon Coven headquarters sprawled out below, a dotting of steel silvers and bright-blues.\par
Beyond that loomed the vast deepening blues of the San Francisco Bay. The Golden Gate twinkled in the distance, a suggestion of gold.\par
Lines of grills stretched down the field that made up most of the garden. Folk milled about grabbing glasses off trays, skewering simmering slabs of 'Drake flank' and 'Roc thigh'—all C-rank treasures.\par
Where was Avery anyway? Zane was just standing here, shuffling foot to foot, munching slowly on his meat slab. People were staring. Even more so than usual that was—some looked as though they were wondering if he was lost.\par
Then he spotted them marching up to meet him. Well, Avery was marching. Evan was scampering behind at her heels.\par
It took Zane a moment to recognize him. Avery had done a number on his hair. It was a mess of braids now, run through with little pastel flowers.\par
"Hey hey!" said Avery, waving enthusiastically. They were both carrying skewers loaded high with meats. She grinned. "So how're you finding the place? Funky huh?"\par
Zane nodded. It was a lot.\par
"Well while you were gone, here's what we've been up to! What do you think?"\par
And she proudly showed off Evan's new hairdo. Evan did a little 360. Zane was no expert in fashion, but…\par
"I know, right?" said Avery. Evan beamed. She gave him a little head pat. "He's been a very good boy."\par
Zane wasn't sure if Avery was aware, but in that moment she could've told Evan to run all the way down to the Bay and swim until he hit Hawaii, and he would've done it no question asked.\par
Then Avery started catching Zane up on everything that had happened since they had last met. She had gone through a big romp through the Midwest. Her friends led the major power there—it was structured like a roaming tribe. Since that region was much less populated, the dungeons tended to be much bigger by area. So the tribe went around dungeon-to-dungeon clearing bosses and she'd tagged along; she wanted to help. They cleared Yellowstone, a B-rank, with a massive party. The final challenge was two bosses at once, which Zane didn't know was a thing. Avery ended up redirecting one of the bosses' attacks to kill the other one.\par
"Ooh! Which reminds me—guess who has an Elemental Law! That's right. This guy!" And she jabbed a thumb at herself. She was quite pleased.\par
Zane blinked, then frowned, then inspected her and found it was true. She had the 'Elemental Law of Water.' Huh.\par
"Just broke through this week!" She said. Then she felt a little embarrassed, and winced. "... I know, I know…still Level 91, though… I'm working on it… I swear, I must be the only person who's been bottlenecked by essence, not Law." She frowned at her skewer, like it was personally responsible.\par
"You can do it!" chirped Evan.\par
"Aww thank you!" said Avery brightly. This earned him another head pat, which Evan was very pleased about.\par
"Where was I? Right! Elemental Law." Then she jabbed a finger right at Zane's chest, and turned up her nose. "Zane Walker, I hereby challenge you to a duel!"\par
"Let me break through first," said Zane helplessly. Everyone wanted to duel him today.\par
"Grr...Fine." She yawned. "Well, anyway. Y'know what you have to do after you hit Elemental? You have to do it all over again! Get a second Law. Then start putting them together, making combinations. Like, Light and Water make... I dunno... Mirage or something? At least that's what Z says."\par
"Z?"\par
"That's the other lunk I told you about! He's kinda like you. You should meet him, you'd like him! Only he's probably in a cave somewhere meditating for a week straight. Or in that Hell Array he keeps grinding. That dude has no life."\par
Zane had a feeling he knew who she was talking about. "Emeka Eze."\par
Avery perked up; she swallowed a chunk of juicy meat. "Hey, that's right! How'd you know?"\par
And Zane talked about the encounter he'd just had. Avery listened, mouth wide open. "No way! He actually talked to you? He's super shy, I can't get him to talk to anyone! But yeah, see? He's really nice once you get to meet him! People are just scared 'cause he keeps one-shotting everyone. That's his Signature Skill by the way, 'Touch of Death.' Anyway."Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\par
She finished off her skewer. She'd spoken the most out of all of them, and somehow she had also eaten the quickest out of all of them. It was like a magic trick. She set it on one of the spare tables; a roaming waiter quickly came to pick it up. Then she grinned. "Well, I'm off! My time slot at the Stormstruck Sea's coming up!" She gave him a salute. "Nice catching up! And it was nice meeting you Evan! See ya soon!"\par
"Mhm!" said Evan.\par
She gave him one last head pat and headed off. Evan waved enthusiastically until she faded behind the trees.\par
Which left just the two of them standing there.\par
Evan turned to Zane beaming. "I'm a good boy!"\par
"... Sure."\par
Evan was pretty much decided. He'd try to break through to Elemental, just like Avery. Then he'd take as many Quests as he could and clear as many dungeons as he could—help as many people as he could, really. If the Tomb Kings were still bullying people, he'd bring them to justice. That kind of thing. Usually, when he told people his dreams, they laughed at him or thought he was silly. But when he'd told Avery, Avery said it was awesome. This was all relayed to Zane in an excited flood.\par
A few things Zane noticed about Evan—he made friends quite easily. And once he was friends with someone, he had a lot of trouble seeing them objectively. For instance, they were going back to the hotel now, and Evan was just a bundle of warm feelings toward him. Zane was pretty sure the boy had never had a bad thought about Zane, like he thought Zane could do no wrong. Zane was a 'good guy' and also his friend, so of course it was the case. It was the same with Avery now.\par
Which was all well and good right now. But it took about an hour for him to be totally smitten with Avery. The thought occurred to Zane—what if someone with bad intentions got a hold of him?\par
As Zane frowned at him, Evan was humming, ambling along, oblivious.\par
It was a good thing he had people looking out for him, Zane decided. Zane would. Now Avery would too.\par
***\par
That evening, he found an A-rank vial of essence waiting for him on the bed, just as Elias had promised. An expensive-looking stained glass vase tied with a velvet red ribbon. He took it. At first, he drank a little too much all at once—and got scalded. Physically he felt nothing, but his soul singed; he jerked back a little. Then he took it slow, sipping it in. And at this rate, it felt more like a warm broth pouring into his soul, filling his head with sleepy warmth.\par
Soon—\par
Level Up!\par
Essence Level 98 -> 99\par
He kept drinking. And drinking, and drinking—it must've been half an hour of just sipping. He spent a little more time digesting, letting the heat of it fade away, soak in.\par
He was getting close to a hard wall he felt. The bottleneck. The closer he got, the less the essence stuck. He stopped halfway through the bottle. He'd save the rest 'till after.\par
Then he tried to sleep. It was surprisingly hard. Usually he could close his eyes and he dropped like a rock. He'd be out in moments. Not this time. It was rare he got this excited.\par
He could feel just how tantalizingly close he was.\par
Soon he did fall asleep.\par
***\par
When he woke, the sun still hadn't risen. But it was close; the sky was lightening, promising the dawn. He felt good, refreshed. It was time.\par
He laid out his War Chest just to take a survey. There was the B+ ranked treasure Titansteel Worldseed—a steel seed the size of his head, veined purple.\par
This seed is the heritage of the Titansteel tree. An immense amount of Elemental Steel Law and pure steel essence is stored within; when consumed it bathes the body in both, creating a potent steel environment. Frequently used to break through bottlenecks in cultivation.\par
There were so many B-rank treasures he could hardly count them. Titansteel Leaves and bushes of Law Fruit…\par
He packed them up and got on his way.\par
It was still mostly dark out, though there was a light blush in the purplish sky. The stars were still out. Runed stone pillars glowed on the sides of the roads like streetlights.\par
Stellar Steel Crater was exactly as he'd left it, except the crowd was half its size. A fair few folk seemed to have stayed overnight. Just sitting there, eyes closed, legs crossed. Comprehending. It was nicely quiet.\par
Just then—'Psst! Savage Sage?" Zane turned to find a thin, freckled, nerdy-looking young man waving at him. He sat on the crater's outermost ring; he seemed to be in the middle of comprehending Law when Zane strode by. He felt quite nervous. His smile certainly showed it.\par
"Hi," he said. His voice cracked a little. He cleared his throat, tried again. "I'm Tommy—I'm a huge fan!"\par
"You are?" It was always a bit baffling meeting someone like this in the wild. Zane never quite got why anyone would be a fan of him.\par
"You're the highest-ranked steel user in the world!" gushed Tommy. "Back in my Safe Zone—I came from this town in the Rockies, see—I was the only steel guy. But since I've been here, at VGI I mean, I made a bunch of friends who're also steel users—we're all huge fans! No one in the world's cracked Elemental Steel. But if anyone's closest, it's you! You’re our biggest inspiration!”\par
“Ah.”\par
Tommy swallowed. "Just—y'know, just curious—can I ask what Law you're gonna work on?"\par
"The Magnetism one. Then I'll try for Elemental."\par
"All in one go?" gasped Tommy. "Wait. You're attempting a breakthrough? Right now?!"\par
"If I can."\par
Suddenly Tommy was excited. "Can I let my friends know? Please? They'd kill me if they missed this!"\par
Zane shrugged. Tommy ran off buzzing. Zane thought nothing of it; he didn't care either way. He got out all his Law Fruit and gulped them down in one big binge. Suddenly his thoughts came in crisp and clear and bright. Not a ripple on the surface of his mind.\par
He waded into the crater. He went past the outer ring, brushing floating steel flakes aside, stepping over silver veins. He went past the middle ring, striding for the meteor, and now those hefty Steel Laws were starting to make their presence known; they poured all over him, crushing over him. He had to fight for every foot of space. But fight he did, heading off those invisible gale-force winds, and he just kept going.\par
He stopped at the same place he stopped yesterday. The edge where the second ring met the first, where it was physically painful to stay. And there he sat. He took out those Titansteel Leaves and spread them around him in a tight ring with him at its center. Already he felt the Laws around him focusing, swirling over him, homing in like a tornado about to make landfall.\par
He took out the Worldseed. He closed his eyes. He reached out with his soul and called to it. And it flooded him with Elemental Steel.\par


\section{107. Breakthrough (II) }
\par
Steel essence poured out of the Worldseed like water escaping a dam. Into him.\par
Zane closed his eyes. He reached out with his soul.\par
Usually, he had to make an effort. It took some searching. Not so right now. It was impossible not to feel Elemental Steel.\par
It screamed at him everywhere. Scathing winds scoured him from the outside. A little tempest brewed from within as the Worldseed gave him more and more, soaking him from the roots of his hair to the nails on his toes. It felt like a second bloodstream pumping fiercely through him, suffusing him totally. It was chock-full of Law—he just had to pick out the one he needed.\par
Magnetism.\par
The Worldseed kept flooding him with steel Law, steel essence. It wasn't just saturation. At a very small level, the tiny things that made up who he was, the structure of his essence, the structure of his body, the stuff of his bone, and marrow, and muscle—it was all shifting as it took on the essence. In subtle, fascinating ways. Shifting the way a magnet shifts, he realized.\par
Suddenly he was acutely aware of the pull on him and within him; it tingled all over. It was like his whole body was the needle of a compass, pointing toward the current. It struck him in an instant—a flash of insight. And he knew the way steel pulled.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Polar Attraction\par
He was shocked how easily it came. It was a good sign.\par
He sought out the other way—the push. It came even easier; he could feel viscerally the wave buffeting him, shoving him all over at once. It wasn't the first time he'd been shoved like this. That Treant had thrown him all over the place. He'd felt the way it worked, felt it down to the bones; push with the soul hand-in-hand with the Universe, and you could make a magnetic field do your bidding. The field was a projection of the will. He was used to pushing and pulling as a purely physical thing. But just as his hand carried out the will of his mind, so too did this field. It was just a different way of pushing. He had to think a little sideways.\par
He could reach out. He could shove back. And when he did—pushing in that same way—he felt the field blooming there too, shoving aside the flakes in the air, shoving at the steel glossing the ground. He could spread it wide, diffusing its force. He could narrow it to just himself and it was like a little force-field, blunting the meteor's currents. He had it.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Repulsive Force\par
Which left just one more steel Law.\par
He took just seconds to find it. He sat there still, and he fell away. The sensations of the body—the little things, the feeling of the weight of him against the ground, the random pricklings on his skin, to the big things, that huge magnetic push-pull… he felt like a child holding onto a bunch of balloons. There was something oddly pure, almost childlike about his state of mind right now…he let go. He watched his body's feelings drift off into the void. All that was left was the soul.\par
One more Law. He'd find it in the currents, he knew. He felt then like an old weathered stone in a wild stormy sea. Not a sea made of water, but not so different. It shoved and pulled and crashed over him just the same. It wasn't one stable flow like he'd first thought. These magnetic currents twisted and curved, played on each other. They were waves, and they came from two sources. He felt that very clearly now.\par
One was the Worldseed. And Zane too, now that he was connected to it. The other was the Meteor. Their waves crashed off each other, and it was the way they interacted that made the landscape of the field around him. In places they doubled, swirled together, grew doubly strong; in others, they crashed and broke against each other.\par
It felt like a eureka moment. He saw it, and he knew it. He knew how he could call on the Universe to disrupt the magnetic field just as you could enhance it. He felt how to break it. How to control it.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Magnetic Flux\par
He was just breezing through these. Something strange was happening to him, something unusual, something wondrous. He was more in tune with the Universe than he'd ever been. Even as he blinked and settled back into himself, he was more there than here. The real world felt unreal. As he looked around and cast out his senses, he saw souls, not bodies. Laws, not forms. Like some kind of X-ray vision that showed him the inner workings of anything and everything. It was so strong right now he wasn't sure he could turn it off if he wanted.\par
He blinked. Huh.\par
When he brought up all the Laws he'd just comprehended, he hardly needed to reach at all. They were just there. And when he put them together, they snapped together easily, like they wanted to come together.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Major Law of Magnetic Command\par
And that was the last Major Law he felt. He had everything.\par
His eyes fluttered open. He breathed out and and looked at the sky. It looked like it had hardly been an hour or two hours, surprisingly—he sun was still halfway up the sky. Early-morning. Then he turned his gaze down and saw a crowd gathered there. Tommy—that steel enthusiast guy—gave him a wave. Right—he said he'd gone to tell his friends Zane was breaking through.If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
That…was a lot of friends. That was something like a hundred people. Maybe his friends told other friends. They flinched as he glanced over; there was a cloud of nervous anticipation hanging over them—more nervous than he was, funnily enough. They were excited too.\par
Then he realized he was glowing. He was kind of like the meteor—he was pouring off Law too. Maybe it was the strange, almost psychedelic feeling state he was in. He figured it was the sheer amount of treasures he was throwing into himself. He had to take advantage of it.\par
One more step. The biggest of all. Zane knew it took weeks, for those other World Rankers to break through this—the ones that managed it anyway. And they were all super-talents.\par
Something told Zane it wouldn't take him that long. He closed his eyes once more, and settled in for the final push.\par
***\par
Not thirty feet away, Cassius Reed, World Rank 33, sat at the edge of the crater's middle ring. Staring as Zane Walker closed his eyes.\par
He felt the magnetic field shifts all around him, bending toward that one man. The disturbance grew stronger second by second… "Incredible," he whispered.\par
Behind him were the elites of his Faction. They've taken the week-long trek here all the way down from Denver. They were here on a Steel Law bootcamp. His second-in-command piped up behind him. "Sir? What is it?"\par
Cassius whirled around. "It's happening!" The rest of them were staring too—no one in the Stellar Steel Crater was comprehending Law anymore. They couldn't if they tried; it was like all the air was being sucked out of the room.\par
"Pay attention!" he said, heart thumping wildly. "If the Savage Sage manages this, it'll be like when Eze broke through. Just being in the blast radius will give us a hell of a boost!"\par
They all nodded. And Cassius turned back too. He could barely breathe.\par
***\par
About a mile away, there was a state-of-the-art arena called the Five Seasons Arena. Its arena could support hundreds of different biome presets, and it could seat tens of thousands. Though there were only two people in it right now.\par
The 1st was a well-built middle-aged man. His swordsmanship was second to none. He wielded a katana that had seen the blood of half a dozen World Rankers. He was dressed in a traditional kimono. He was World Rank \#17, Niko Tanaka.\par
The 2nd was a very pretty young man, late teens, in stylish silk robes. He wore his hair long and wild, windblown. In his hands was a simple yet elegant painter's brush. He was World Rank \#6, Yuki Urabe.\par
They sparred on floating islands. Bits of greenery fuzzed huge chunks of brown stone. Niko roared and leaped at him, face red, bulging muscles straining against his kimono top, sweating up a storm. He slashed, slashed again; the air erupted with sword-light.\par
But Yuki just smiled lazily and danced out of the way. Gently, without a fuss. Then he swept his brush in a simple clean pattern, and painted a zephyr into being: a pink-purple wind poured into the world. It didn't move particularly fast, nor did it come particularly fiercely. But somehow Niko couldn't get out of the way. He was knocked sprawling into the depths. A gentle blue wind carried the frazzled World Ranker to safety.\par
Niko shook his head, gasping. "Every time. You could at least pretend to struggle, young master. For my dignity."\par
Yuki tapped the base of his brush against his lips, pretending to consider it. "Hmm…" Then he smirked. "Nah."\par
Then they both stilled. Niko frowned. Yuki raised his brows. "Oh?"\par
"Is that that Brit? Hastings?” said Niko, baffled. "Surely not. Last I heard, he was still a Major Law away!"\par
"Who knows?" mused Yuki.\par
***\par
A few miles away lay the Earth Cavern of Insight—Mantle Core. It was a stretch of underground tunnels going two-and-a-half miles underground. Chambers popped up throughout. Each was more dense with Law than the last. Each had a higher pressure too.\par
The chamber at the very bottom was the highest-pressured of them all. Its walls were pure bedrock, and even they were cracked all the way through. The fissures on the ground ran to unfathomably deep places. If you spat here, it'd evaporate before it touched the ground. Even the fires on the torches had trouble staying upright.\par
And only one man sat within. Meditating. Emeka Eze opened his eyes, revealing pure gold pupils. He cocked his head, felt the tremors on the air. He smiled knowingly.\par
***\par
More and more folk were joining the crowd around the Stellar Steel Crater. One Xiaoshan Chen, World Rank \#13, had a transmission crystal clutched tight in his palm. Watching closely. A breakthrough wasn't likely. Even Eze took four tries, spread out across two weeks, to break through.\par
Yet there were rumors that there was something different about the Savage Sage. A kind of comprehension talent no one had ever seen before… just rumors. Nothing concrete. Yet Chen supposed he was about to get an answer.\par
If this happened, his boss—the World Rank \#5 Jian Shi Ming, the Spitfire Monk—would like to know. Among World Rankers, he only considered the other perfect-talent powers his true rivals.\par
Depending on what happened today, there could be an exception.\par
It wasn't just top World Rankers coming to watch. Most of the crowd were in the Level 50s, 60s, hailing from all over the world. It was a very rare thing that a top World Ranker performed his breakthrough in public like this. They were just here to witness history.\par
***\par
But by then Zane was far gone. He wasn't conscious of them at all. The Major Laws of Steel began to cascade in his mind, one after another. Slowly he drew them together; it felt like moving heavy objects. He had to drag each of these heavy concepts with his soul and hold them all up at once. Even for him it was a painful, shaky effort.\par
And yet there was no stopping him now. He would find harmony.\par
First came the Major Law of Undying Might. It felt like playing a note—something mighty, and bellowing, and unyielding.\par
Then he drew in a second note. Echoing Clangor. A struck gong. Jarring and clashing, and yet, pitched just right, it was somehow in tune with the first. Together they made a new sound. A beautiful sound.\par
Carefully, Zane drew in a third. Pure Forging—the melding of metal and spirit, the burning away of impurities, and it sang out clear and high…\par
Somehow, thinking of them this way just made sense. At least, to his mind as it was right now; he was thinking at right angles to everything. But it was working. He went with it.\par
Absolute Sharpness came next, slicing through all the other sounds. It was the hardest to meld so far. But Zane found where it fit in. The harmony was only growing fuller…\par
Then came Steely Density, lowest of the bunch, and the deepest. It sank into the depths of the harmony, making up the lowest register.\par
Magnetic Command was the last of them, a field of pushing and pulling and fluctuating, a note that spread over it all. Saturating it.\par
They were all playing at once now. One perfect harmonic spectrum. And he found within it the essence of steel, something that resonated with him, and the Universe, all at once. It was there when swords clashed and hammers rang; there in untold millions of battles and forges; there in the mundane things too—the bridges, the pillars, the lightning-rods, and the compasses; it held up the world; you found it in the heart of stars and the fists of men alike. Strong. Pure. Sharp. Dense. Resonant. Magnetic.\par
I know you.\par
Zane opened his eyes.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Elemental Law of Steel\par


\section{108. Breakthrough (III) }
\par
A single note rang out. A silvery note, a note of the soul. It was the same note Zane felt in that Steelheart Conclave Law recording. Now it spread from him, washing outward, touching the souls of hundreds, all at once. Resonating.\par
Suddenly the bottleneck fell away; some constriction vanished from his soul. Essence could flow freely again. The last of the Worldseed's essence rushed into him. It was almost enough to break past Level 100—but not quite.\par
After finishing off that A-grade Vial of Elixir though, he'd be there. Then he'd be a true Foundation cultivator.\par
He breathed out and opened his eyes; his breath was a puff of silver rising to star-dotted dusky skies. Huh. The sun was setting. What day was it? He wasn't even sure.\par
He stood. Something felt odd. It was those Steel Law currents. They'd been screaming at him all this time, but they'd gone quiet now. Like they couldn't touch him anymore. They felt gentle as breezes. He realized he was his own font of Elemental Law—it streamed out of him. Blunting the Meteor’s Elemental Steel Law. They were equals.\par
He strode up into the first ring of the Crater, where silvery veins pulsed like heart-valves of the earth, where the ground was glossed totally silver, where the Steel Law was densest. He met no resistance. He strode right up to the Meteor, reached out a hand, and touched it. It was firm and very cold. When he did, he felt a resonance in his soul too. Like two songbirds singing the same pure note.\par
He smiled.\par
***\par
Chen Xiaoshan, Wold Rank \#13 and emissary of the Mount Hua Temple, was trembling as he activated his transmission crystal.\par
A brash voice streamed out. It was breathing heavy; you could make out the deep-throated roaring of some Monster in the background.\par
"This had better be important,” it said. Followed by a grunt. "These damned A-ranked dungeons, I swear—“ Explosions in the background. "Such a nuisance!"\par
"It is important, Master," said Chen. "You won't believe this.”\par
"Bah!" There was a massive cracking sound. Then a howl, like that same Monster had just been fatally wounded. "Speak!"\par
"Master—from this day forth, a new great power rises in the West…"\par
***\par
Siberia\par
Vanessa Volkova was blasted off her feet. She crashed into the icy tundra, shattering a plate of glassy frost. She barely had time to scramble to a knee—then a silky-white sash wrapped around her throat.\par
And then she was cased in ice. Frozen solid.\par
The ice melted all at once, sloshing away. And she fell gasping.\par
"Good," said Irina Volkova. One clipped syllable.\par
"Really?" said Vanessa. She brightened. Then she flushed, schooled her expression, cleared her throat. "That is—thank you, Mother."\par
"As opposed to your last hundred attempts. Which were not even passable. Good should be the standard."\par
Vanessa sagged. "Oh."\par
Irina paused. "But," she sighed. "There has been a definite improvement in the past month. Don't think I haven't noticed. Keep it up."\par
"Yes, Mother!" Her daughter was blushing again. Embarrassing. Vanessa had many flaws, and being needy was certainly one of them. But Irina couldn't be too annoyed. Now her daughter was willing to put in the effort to improve herself; that was what mattered. It gave Irina hope.\par
The talent had always been there. Her daughter was as talented as Irina was—it was what frustrated Irina so. Vanessa had such gifts, yet she frittered time on nonsense. Boys and clothes and partying—before and after the Change. And she walked around so proudly all the time. Proud of what? She'd accomplished nothing. Irina told her so almost daily, but it never seemed to get through.Stolen novel; please report.\par
Before the Change, Irina had been head coach of the Russian national team in Olympic judo. Before that, she'd gold-medaled thrice for the Soviet Union. And before that, she spent twenty years straight waking up before dawn and swimming in freezing lakes—and that was a warm-up for a full day of grueling full-contact sparring with world-class black belts from dawn till dusk.\par
Yet Vanessa knew nothing of discipline, despite Irina's frustrated efforts. Even that America trip—which should have been a training trip—was little more than an excuse for sightseeing.\par
But something happened on that trip. When Vanessa came back, there was a new spark in her. Finally. She grew obsessed with getting stronger; she seemed embarrassed of herself. As she should be. Since then, she'd shot up to \#14 on the Wold Rankings.\par
Irina was equal parts proud and annoyed. She'd had this in her all along? Where would she be if she just applied herself from the start?\par
Irina had only seen her like this over a boy.\par
…If she was honest, Irina half-suspected it was the case again. Her daughter was as foolish as she was gifted.\par
Then the transmission crystal in Irina's trouser pocket glowed hot. The one only made for emergencies or other such news. Frowning, she undid the leather strap, reached past the wool lining, and brought it out. Then she listened to what it had to say.\par
"What is it?" Vanessa asked.\par
"Have you heard of this—" Irina paused, listened for the name again. "Zane Walker? An American.” She noted how Vanessa flinched at the name—her face instantly reddened. Interesting.\par
“He has just broken through to Elemental, apparently. In record time.”\par
Vanessa gasped. Her hands balled to fists. “He got there before me? I was supposed to—ugh!"\par
"Who is he?"\par
"No-one!" said Vanessa a little too loudly. She flushed. "Just… someone I met. In America. Someone who... Let's just say the next time we meet, I'll show him!” She clenched her teeth. “Next time I’ll be the one who—err—" she flushed hotter and broke off. "… nevermind…”\par
So it was over a boy.\par
Irina pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed.\par
Whatever the cause, her daughter was the most motivated she'd been in a long time. Irina would take it. "Again!"\par
***\par
"I don't understand," murmured Mason Smith. He and his father were from Utah. His father was the leader of the Faction that controlled it; they were both conservationists. They dreamed of making Utah something as close to a paradise as they could manage. They figured the apocalypse was also a chance to start over—to create their own little nature community.\par
But to do that, they needed power to protect everyone there. So they'd bought tickets to VGI, and here they were.\par
They'd been cultivating in the Elven Glade—the big Wood Law area—when they'd heard news that the Savage Sage was breaking through.\par
His father had gotten all excited. He’d dragged Mason here to watch it happen.\par
Mason didn't get the hype. "Didn't someone get to Foundation just last week?"\par
His father, Noah, looked over. Noah followed the top rankers very closely; he said it was his job, but Mason always thought it was his new thing now he couldn't watch Jazz games anymore. "Well, son," he said in a hoarse voice. "You know the super-geniuses, don't you?"\par
"Yeah. Like the guy who's number one on the Hell array—that Eze guy."\par
"Well, he broke through to Elemental in twenty-three hours. It took him three tries. And the Joker Savant took twenty-two hours, and it also took her three tries. Yuki, that Japanese fella, took twenty hours in two tries. The fastest we knew of was Jason Walker! Two tries. Eighteen hours…"\par
He shook his head.\par
“The Savage Sage took thirteen hours. One try."\par
"…Oh."\par
***\par
Zane put on his serious face and started walking purposefully back to the hotel, which seemed to be enough to dissuade the crowd from trying to talk to him. To his relief. They were chattering up a storm.\par
Once he was back, he drank the last of his A-rank Vial of Essence. It took about half an hour to get down. Then—\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 100\par
Level 100 reached. Third class evolution unlocked. For all class evolutions:\par
Soul Weapon Upgrade:\par
Elemental Powers can be channeled directly through the Chains, greatly increasing the efficacy of all Skills which use elemental powers or elemental power fusions.\par
Oh?\par
Chain Warlord (Mythic)\par
The Chain Warlord is a demon of single combat. It wields its harpoons to spear its enemies and drag them in, where it finishes them in its crushing Chain embrace. A class which blends dominating grappling with devastating striking.\par
New Soul Weapon Form:\par
Anti-armor Harpoon Form - The Chains' ends become fiery, barbed harpoons that can be launched with deadly precision and incredible speed. They carry tremendous armor-piercing capabilities which scale with Level.\par
Hellfire Tempest (Mythic)\par
The Hellfire Tempest is a one-man army. Its tornado-blades tear through essence and flesh with ease, and once its attacks build, they don't stop. Once it gets going, it resembles a natural disaster.\par
New Soul Weapon Form:\par
Tornado Blade Form - The Chain's ends become spinning blades that create fierce tornadoes upon contact with the ground or an enemy. These tornadoes tear apart formations and can hurl opponents into the air, leaving them sitting ducks for further shredding. Pairs excellently with existing Cyclone-based Skills.\par
Dread Bastion (Mythic)\par
The Dread Bastion is a fortress. It specializes in absorbing the powers of incoming strikes to fuel its counterblows, which erupt in meteoric fury. A balanced class offering formidable offense and defense.\par
New Soul Weapon Form:\par
Meteor Hammer Form - The Chains' ends become akin to heavy molten wrecking-balls; they move like true meteors, fast and ferocious. They trail flames and debris as they fly, exploding on impact and leaving craters behind. They are constantly burning. Weight scales with Level.\par


\section{109. Third Class Evolution }
\par
Zane liked the Chain Warlord a lot. The idea of using a harpoon and dragging them in… You couldn't grapple much with axes, so he'd let that part of his style rust a little. But he had a soft spot for it.\par
The main problem with Axes was also why he liked grappling. Lots of his enemies nowadays were birds. Or almost-birds, like that Javier. They wouldn't hold still. He liked it when he could just hold an enemy down and crush them. Maybe this could let him do that.\par
He also liked the Tempest one. Then again, he already had Stormfire Cyclone. With this he could enhance it, make it even stronger in crowds. But it seemed a bit too specialized. He wanted to be strong everywhere.\par
Then there was Dread Bastion, which he really liked too. Cutting was fun, as he'd done with Axes. But his favorite way to fight had always been smashing. There was something pure about it. Just plain smash. The thought gave him a simple pleasure.\par
He stood there for a few moments, eyes closed, smiling a little just thinking about it.\par
It was between Dread Bastion and Chain Warlord for him. The main thing stopping him from going Bastion right away was the grappling bit. He liked having anti-bird measures.\par
But… could he do that with Bastion too? The meteor sounded pretty fast. Maybe not as fast as those Harpoons, but still—he figured they'd go faster than his Axes had. Maybe for birds, he could use one of these meteors like an anchor—it said it was heavy, right? He just had to get one hit in. Then he'd wrap them up, weigh them down with a meteor. And then he could close in and crush them. Ground and pound.\par
Hm… Okay. He smiled and picked it.\par
Class gained! Dread Bastion!\par
Level-up stat bonus: Vitality: +1.5, Regeneration: +0.8, Strength: +1.2, Dexterity: +0.7, Speed: +0.8\par
Class Skill Learned!\par
Wish Upon a Star (Passive) [Mythic]\par
A fraction of all damage inflicted on the Bastion's body is absorbed and can be re-used through the Meteor Hammer. Once fully charged, Give-and-Take temporarily grants a huge boost to the Meteor Hammer's Power, Speed, and elemental might. Akin to becoming a shooting star. Recharge time: 1 hour.\par
Spirit Weapon Upgraded!\par
Prometheus Chains III\par
A tool of wisdom and fire, capable of binding and annihilation both. The\par
Signature Weapon of the Savage Sage. Currently at the third stage.\par
Stage I Powers: Heavy to others, light to the Sage, its weight scales with\par
the Sage's level.\par
Stage II Powers: The Chains can now be shortened and lengthened at will, up to a mile long. The longer they get, the more difficult to control.\par
Stage III Powers: Elemental Powers can be channeled directly through the Chains, greatly increasing the efficacy of all Skills which use elemental powers or elemental power fusions.\par
New Soul Weapon Form:\par
Meteor Hammer Form - The Chains' ends become enormously heavy molten wrecking balls that move like true meteors, fast and ferocious. They trail flames and debris as they fly, exploding on impact, devastating the enemy and leaving craters behind. They are constantly burning.\par
***\par
Sadly, he was a little too burned out to weave in his Steel Laws to anything right now. He might've been the most burned out he'd ever been. Not in the ways he'd been before, which had been painful. Right now he felt a good kind of exhaustion, like a marathon runner might feel after crossing the finish line.\par
It still meant he wasn't going anytime soon. Maybe if he got a few hours rest, he could weave Stormfire into Skills that already used Fire—that was very simple, essentially effortless. But anything strenuous… give it a week, maybe. He wasn't sure.\par
***\par
Unbeknownst to Zane, while he was tinkering with his new Class like a kid the morning after Christmas, news of his breakthrough spread faster than he would've believed.\par
In the time it took from sunset to sunrise, most everyone on the planet knew. There was a monstrous genius who'd broken through Foundation in half a day. Every World Ranker took note. Especially those at the top.\par
For some—that elite handful—the news just inflamed their fighting spirits. But that was because they had supreme confidence in his powers and talents. They took notice, but that was all.\par
Most everyone else treated the news with fear, or suspicion, or awe. Sometimes all three. No one else existed with Zane's combinations of talents. To them, that made him uniquely dangerous.\par
One top ranker, though, had a rather different reaction.\par
***\par
New York City\par
The skies were choked with smog. Rolling waves of smog so thick you had no hope of seeing the sun. They came from the stacks of smoke drifting up from below. And so many fires burning across the devastated, soot-blackened dungeon it looked like a mockery of a night sky.\par
This was the A-ranked Dungeon called 'The Sixth Gate of Hell.' It had been chock full of demons. Just this morning, there had been no smoke. No fires. Then a party of two came in.A case of theft: this story is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.\par
The first of them did most of the damage.\par
He stood amid the hellscape; fires tainted black licked the air all around him. He was a very handsome man, muscular yet lean, with wind-swept black hair. He looked very much like Zane Walker. He had slightly sharper features, crueler eyes, a smaller build. But put them side by side and it'd be clear they were brothers.\par
Jason Walker breathed heavily, slicked with black blood. He stood in a chaotic, steaming, broken-up mess; it looked like a bomb had detonated where he stood and he was knee-deep in the aftermath. It'd take you a few seconds to piece together what you were looking at.\par
A giant demon. Shredded so badly it was unrecognizable; those shredded meat-strips were wings. That blown-out meat paste, its torso. It lay splayed out like a taxidermied animal. Its slitted yellow cat-like eyes bulged; it was going through its death throes; black blood dribbled out of pale lips. This thing was the Level 115 Boss Sariel, Lord of Wraiths.\par
Around its neck hung a grisly noose. A trail led down to its wide-open stomach; its guts had been ripped out of its body and forced around its throat. It'd been strangled in its own entrails.\par
Its blood was still drying on Jason Walker's hands. He stood there, breathing heavy. Next to him, World Rank \#2 D'Angelo Hall shook his head. "You're a sick son of a bitch."\par
But Jason just grinned and licked the Monster blood off his lips. Then he frowned. He reached into his silk pocket and brought his speaking crystal to his ear. He listened for a while. Then his grin widened into a feral smile, baring all his white teeth; he began to laugh.\par
"What now?"\par
"You know that little brother I told you about?"\par
"Yeah?"\par
"He just broke through to Foundation." Jason sighed. "He's finally grown up! About fucking time."\par
"Christ," snorted Hall. "Now there's two of you? Don't tell me he's like you."\par
Jason cocked his head. There was mirth in his eyes. "In the important things… oh, yes. He's very much like me."\par
***\par
Knock-knock.\par
Zane went to open the door. The moment he did—\par
"Congrats!"\par
There were Evan and Avery; Evan beamed, Avery grinned. There was one of those birthday streamer thingies in Evan's mouth. He was blowing on it all excited. Then he took it out. "You did it!" He exclaimed.\par
Then he bent over, put down the streamer, and picked up something fluffy at his feet. "Look! I made it for you."\par
It was a cake. It looked surprisingly well put together too—it had tiers and everything, white with gold lettering. The lettering said, "Congratulations on getting to Foundation!! I knew you could do it! You inspire me every day! —your friend Evan."\par
From someone else it might've sounded corny, but Zane knew Evan meant every word of it. So he just smiled and felt kind of warm. "Thanks. I'll enjoy this."\par
"Mhm!"\par
Avery wrinkled her nose at Evan. "See, now you're making me look bad. All I brought was a hearty high-five."\par
And suddenly Evan was worried. "Wait!" He cried. "I—I didn't mean—"\par
"Pshhhh!" Grinning, she ruffled his hair. "I'm just ragging on you."\par
"Oh…"\par
"Anyway! So, Zane. How are you going to spend your breakthrough day?"\par
Zane thought about it for a bit. Then he shrugged. "I'm gonna train, probably."\par
"Yeah, thought so. Welp. You have fun! Maybe go check out that Asura Hell thing and see how many fake-demons you can bonk. We're going to the Thousand Ray Desert. That's the Light Law area, by the way. I'm trying to get the Elemental Law of Light next, maybe try putting it together with Water. I think I might make like Mirage or Illusion or something? It'll take a while though… at least another five or six months just to get the dang thing. And then there's putting it together. Who knows if that's even what you're supposed to do! Anyway. Turns out Evan's trying to get the same Elemental Law, so this works out."\par
"Yup!" said Evan.\par
"Don't worry about him," said Avery, nodding sagely. "You can do your own thing. I'll keep him out of trouble. I'm very responsible."\par
Zane cocked a brow. He was more concerned about Avery getting him in trouble than the other way around.\par
Then again, Evan was a little too trusting for his own good. Which… maybe not the best thing in a place like this. Having Avery around was a good idea.\par
Evan gave a happy little wave, Avery a salute. They were just about to head off when she halted—\par
"Oh wait! I almost forgot." She turned around and held up a hand, grinning. "I owe you a high five!"\par
"…Thanks." He high-fived her, since it seemed like she wasn't going to put it down until he did.\par
"In case you're inclined to be thoughtful like Evan here and give me a breakthrough present—I'd like to say that I've always wanted to ride on your head and make you go places by pulling your hair, like the guy from Ratatouille." She grinned. "Just putting that out there."\par
"No."\par
"Aww… please? What if—hear me out—just a few hours, we don't even have to go very far. Ooh, maybe we can do a dungeon raid and I could ride you into battle! Wait! Don't you—"\par
He closed the door in her face.\par
He was itching to go test out his new powers, maybe at that Hell Array thing. But first, he took the cake, sat down at the table, and got a spoon, and slowly savored it until he was done.\par
It was a very good cake. He made sure he'd let Evan know next time they met.\par
***\par
The next time he walked outside, there was a crowd outside the hotel. He wondered what it was for until they all started shouting when they saw him.\par
"Savage Sage! Savage Sage!"\par
"Mr. Walker! How did you get those Laws so fast? Is it just your mindset, or a treasure, or—"\par
"I'm from Portland, I've been a fan since you destroyed the Cult of Black Flame! I'm your \#1 fan!"\par
"Do you have beef with the other top rankers?"\par
They were shouting about so many things he couldn't keep them straight.\par
"World Number 7 Cristina dos Santos said you used a trick—she says you had to burn your lifespan to do it so fast! Do you have anything to say?"\par
"Can I have one of your treasures?"\par
"Why are you so big? Does it help you absorb more Laws?"\par
The headache was getting a little too much. Zane wasn't a people person. He really wasn't a crowds person.\par
He flared his aura. Law boiled out of him and the rest of them went stumbling back; now they watched from a respectful distance as he moved through. He kept the pressure on as he walked, and they didn't bother him directly anymore. This was what Eze had done the first time they'd met, he realized. Now it made sense.\par
He had a fine time walking for all of a few hundred feet before he got accosted again. This time by just one person.\par
"Hey there!" Elias sidled up next to him. "Buddy! It's your favorite Venture Capitalist again—just wanted to say congratulations, man. That's crazy. I knew your soul talent was off the charts, literally, but still—wait up!"\par
He had to run to catch up; Zane certainly wasn't slowing for him. He gave a thin little smile. "Alright, I didn't just come to congratulate you," he said. "You see, I have a bit of a… situation?"\par
"Don't care."\par
"I'll give you an A-rank treasure! Hell—An A-rank Fire Law treasure! The only one I've got!"\par
Zane stopped, looked at him sideways. "You have thirty seconds."\par
"Excellent! So—you know I've got this feud with the Tomb Kings, right? Turns out the head honcho, Mike Masters—World Rank \#8 by the way, one below you—turns out he broke through to Foundation a few weeks ago! And he’s decided he doesn't care about this little gathering of World Rankers I've got going on. He's coming for my throat anyway. Now this is a little inconvenient for me, as you may imagine." Elias swallowed. "His wants to conquer the rest of my Faction, lay siege to my headquarters, wait 'till the event's over— all the World Rankers leave—and then… well…"\par
He licked his lips. "Long story short, he's coming. Not great! And he's bringing six of the top thirty in the world, including him. He'll reach the warzone by… oh… end of the day? So I'd be just delighted if you could take care of him for me, and fast. Again. A-rank Law treasure, up for grabs! What do you say?"\par
Now this was interesting. … Honestly, he might have accepted even if there was no reward. Fighting six of the world's best sounded pretty fun.\par
An A-rank Fire Law Treasure… that also sounded pretty good. He would've taken it a few months ago.\par
But Elias was looking ready to tear his hair out. And Zane had spent a lot of time around Reina, and some of it rubbed off. He knew it was a good time to negotiate.\par


\section{110. Big Deal}
\par
"I want three A-ranked Law treasures," said Zane.\par
Elias gagged. "You want what." \par
"One Electricity, one Fire, One Wood."\par
"Wood?!"\par
"It's for Reina."\par
Elias goggled at him. Then he took a deep breath, in and out, and plastered on a wobbly little smile. "Let's take a step back here. That A-rank Vial of Essence—that may have given you the wrong impression. That was a very rare, very generous gift I gave you! It was a one-time thing. Look, I have less than twenty A-rank treasures left. And I've got the biggest treasure stockpile in the world!"\par
Zane shrugged. "Then no deal." \par
He kept walking; he heard Elias wheeze behind him. "Wait, wait!" he gasped, scrambling to catch up. "Okay! How about this—one A-rank Fire treasure, a B+-rank Electricity treasure, and a B-rank Wood treasure. That's as far as I can go!"\par
"No."\par
Elias winced. He smiled a little wider. "Look. Zane. Buddy. That's not how this works—you're supposed to make a counteroffer! Say—' I want two A-rank treasures instead.' We've got to compromise here!"\par
"I'm not like Reina," Zane informed him. "I am very bad at negotiating. I don't get it. I want three A-rank treasures. I'm not changing my mind."\par
Elias looked flabbergasted. "But—that's—" \par
Zane started to walk away again.\par
"Can't we be reasonable, civil men?" shouted Elias from somewhere behind. \par
"No." \par
There was a silence. Then he heard Elias running after him again.\par
"Alright, alright!" Elias said hastily. "Two A-ranked treasures, one Electricity, one Fire. You're killing me here, but fine! As for the Wood treasure—B's the highest I can go." \par
"If I don't get three A-ranked treasures, no deal." \par
"Are you serious?" cried Elias. "There's two A-ranked treasures on the table, and you're walking away 'cause of this?!" \par
"Yes." Reina deserved an A-rank too. She deserved the best Elias had, but Zane doubted he had an S-rank. So Zane settled for A.\par
"Fine! Y'know what?" snapped Elias. "I'll go ask Eze. Or Yuki! You're not the only top ranker here, you know. I'm sure they'd be a lot more agreeable!"\par
Zane shrugged. "Okay."\par
"That's it?!"\par
"Please get out of my way. I have training to do."\par
Elias let out a series of choking noises. Then—"Fine! Have it your way!" He massaged his jaw like Zane had punched him. "Jesus Christ, man."\par
Zane blinked. "So we have a deal?"\par
Elias glared at him. "We do."\par
"Then I'll take care of your man."\par
Elias wiped the sweat off his face and sighed. He tried putting on a friendly smile again, but it didn't quite make it to his lips this time. He just looked to be in pain. "Alrighty then… You know, it's a little more than I would have usually agreed to, but for a friend, alright. Three A-rank Treasures to take out the king and all his marquises. Done!" \par
Then Zane had a thought. "Wait. I want one more treasure."\par
"Oh, come on!" Elias let out a string of colorful curses. Then he wagged a finger at Zane. "You understand this is already a fifth of my wealth?! You think A-ranked treasures grow on trees, do you?! If you're asking for another, we're done. And this time I mean it! I'd rather pack my bags and sail to Hawaii! You're taking me for all I'm worth here!"\par
He was so dramatic, huffing and puffing. It was kind of funny to watch.\par
"This should be easy to spare," Zane assured him. "I just need one of those…"\par
He wasn't sure how to describe it actually. It was the invigorating elixir he'd gotten in the crater, the one that worked like an energy drink for the soul—that let him ignore his soul fatigue for a bit so he could do some light comprehension work. Elias seemed to know what he was talking about though.\par
"Alright. Fine—and this is the last thing!" said Elias. He glared at Zane as though daring Zane to challenge him.\par
Zane nodded.\par
"And you should know, by the way," Elias continued. "If you use this you'll take longer to recover. It's not a miracle potion."\par
"I know."\par
Zane didn't care. He had plans—he wanted to take something into battle. Make use of this new Elemental Law. If he upgraded his Spirit Steel Body and paired it with that new damage-soaking Skill… could be interesting.\par
Elias stared at him twitching. Then he gave a sigh and a forlorn chuckle. "You're either going to make me a very rich man," he said. "Or you'll bankrupt me."\par
He shook his head, smiling ruefully. "Well! Let's hope I've bet right for both our sakes, eh?"\par
He patted Zane on the back and left. "I'll give you the pepper-up treasure now. You'll get the rest when the task is done. I'll draw up a contract—"\par
"Give me your Essence Beacon. I'll send it to Reina first. I'll only sign if she approves it."\par
"Yeah, yeah," Elias waved a hand like he'd expected it. He gave Zane a pat on the back, one last full-body sigh, and shuffled off.Stolen story; please report.\par
There was a time Elias had been menacing. Zane wasn't sure how. Right now he just seemed like a goofy little guy. \par
***\par
After they got the contract taken care of—Reina took less than an hour to come back with the OK. They signed, and Zane got his 'pepper-up elixir'—\par
Essence of Morning Dew (B) \par
 Rejuvenates the soul, temporarily alleviating soul fatigue at the cost of a longer recovery. \par
He took them back at the hotel. Not much, just a few drops. Enough to wipe out that dragging tiredness in his soul. Suddenly he was buzzing again.\par
He turned his mind to his Man of Steel Skill. It had almost every Major Steel Law already. But Elemental Steel wasn't just a bunch of Major Laws—it was something greater than all of them combined.\par
He had to weave in the whole Elemental Law all over again. It took another dew-drop to bear him through. About an hour later—\par
Skill evolved! \par
 Man of Steel -> Flawless Steel Body\par
Imbues the body with all the properties of Elemental Steel. Renders the user very difficult to damage through any physical methods. This Skill has reached the end of its Law Skill tree and can only be further Leveled through experience.\par
***\par
So that was everything. He was ready to test it all out. \par
The first time he tried his new Class and Skills and Law probably shouldn't be against a top World Ranker in a battle to the death. He could do with some warm-up. Iron out the kinks.\par
He thought about how to go about it as he strolled through the crowd. There was a weird magnetic effect to him now. It was fascinating to see; people's eyes were drawn to him, but they cleared out the way of his aura. Attracting but also repelling. Anyway.\par
He could go to the Warrior Dojo here. Supposedly it was impressive. He could rent out one of their training rooms and test his Skills on some dummies. But he had a better idea. He was headed to the Asura Hell Array. This thing simulated Monsters, right?\par
When he got to it—that giant thick ring of runed steel with swirling, eerily glowing purplish insides—Even the Silicon Coven guards gave way for him. They did little more than bow and nod and scramble out of the way. There was an operator lady there. Her bobbed blonde hair was stuffed in a silver cap.\par
"For you, Mr. Walker, Mister Ventor has ordered that each run is done at cost," she said, smiling. "The discounted charge is five high-grade essence stones. Due to the nature of the simulation, the cost increases by two essence stones per Level cleared.”  \par
"How long does a run take?" he said.\par
"It varies. For the top performers, between three and five hours."\par
Zane didn't have that long. He'd be fighting at sundown and it was around noon already—and he still had to travel a ways South… \par
"Can I cut a run short?"\par
The operator blinked, surprised. Zane got the sense people normally didn't ask. "Err—yes, sir. I…"\par
She tapped an essence crystal on her wrist, frowned, and nodded. "Yes. I must warn you—doing so leaves Skill gains on the table.” \par
"That's fine," said Zane nodding. He just wanted to get some good combat practice in, and this was a quick easy way to do it. He'd come back to do a real run later. Even the discounted cost wasn't nothing, but he figured it was worth it. He'd make it back many, many times over from the Tomb Kings' Bags of Holding.\par
"Very well, sir," said the operator. "Did you have a time limit in mind?"\par
"Pull me out after half an hour passes." Should be enough to get warmed up. He just wanted to get a feel for everything. \par
"Understood. I'll fire up the array now…"\par
A staff appeared in her gloved hands. She closed her eyes and held it out. And the crystal at its tip started shining emerald green. So did the runes lining the steel. Then the portal itself started glowing too; he felt a glut of essence streaming out, so thick it felt like humidity on his skin—like he'd just cracked a window on the hottest day of summer. \par
He looked to the stone tablet leaderboard right next to it. The numbers hadn't moved since yesterday—\par
CAIN HASTINGS, 453 KILLS\par
 YUI URABE, 550 KILLS\par
 EMEKA EZE, 642 KILLS\par
Right. He still owed Eze a fight, didn't he?\par
He wondered how he'd do once he gave this thing a real try…\par
First things first.\par
"It's ready, sir," said the operator. "The Asura Hell Array creates a semi-real simulation of the Nine Layers of Hell; your soul utilizes real essence, but there is no damage to the physical body. Each Layer has one hundred Monsters. The array grants essence gains via the spirit stones powering it. The main benefit is that Skill Leveling is drastically accelerated. It only grows the further you get in the Array. Good luck, sir."\par
Zane nodded and stepped on through.\par
He felt something click in his soul. Or rather—it was like when he was very tired, and he fell asleep on his feet, then jerked out of it. A little static shock to the soul. He was here, everything paused. Then started. And he was somewhere else.\par
The sky was a heady swirl of brilliant orange and vibrant red—sunset in a world on fire. The blackened ground was cracked all over; those cracks were lit up by something gurgling deep below. In the distance, he saw tornados of swirling flame raging across the ragged landscape; he heard their low crackling echoing down the plains. The air dragged to breathe; it was flaky with volcanic ash—it tasted like tar in his mouth. \par
He knew it was a simulation, but it certainly felt realistic. \par
Then fires popped up in front of him. All across the landscape. One after another. So thick and overbearing he knew they had to be Elemental Fire. Craggy stone legs stepped out; lava poured down from their joints. The things that emerged were as big as houses, with eyes the same color as the sky. When they opened their mouth and groaned at him, he found that color burning there too. Coming from dozens of mouths, it sounded like thunder rolling across the desolate plains. \par
Giant Magma Golem \par
Essence Level 90\par
Right then! Feeling giddy, he summoned his new toy.\par
The moment he did, he felt it in his soul—these two shining globes of sheer mass. For a second he lost all sense of balance; it felt like his soul was tilting sideways. Something like vertigo but stronger. He was used to throwing around his Chains like they weighed nothing, even his Axe. It was all made lighter by his Chain's powers.\par
Even with that helping, the meteors still slipped out of his mental grip.\par
They hit the ground to either side of him.\par
Then the world whited out. He heard nothing. His skin was wrapped in fire—his own fire, borne of his own essence. He tried blinking all the everything out of his eyes, unhinged his jaw a little, tried working out the ringing. \par
He was standing on thin air, staring down at the distant grounds. Huh. \par
It seemed the explosion shot him so high into the sky he almost hit the cloud layer. It would've been a lot higher if he wasn't anchored by his Chains. As he fell, singed all over, ears ringing, eyes tearing up a little, he made a mental note to be very careful about dropping these meteors. \par
On his way down he got a good look at them. They lay in new craters that ran surprisingly wide—thirty feet across or so, overlapping in a smoldering Venn diagram. They did look like wrecking balls—these perfectly smooth spheres so dark they seemed like voids cut out in the world, so dark they seemed two-dimensional. They were wreathed in flames burning so hot they were nearly white; black holes cut out in a white blaze—it was an odd sight. Zane liked it. Flames that showed no signs of dying down. The description did say they were ever-burning. Neat.\par
He wondered if he could add Stormfire to these things. Maybe with a little more of that pepper-up elixir… \par
Wait. Where had all the Monsters gone? He couldn't have sworn there was a few dozen right in front of him a second ago. Then he noticed there were a lot more smoldering molten rocks scattered about than before. They looked like they could be legs, torsos, the husks of fingers… he saw one that could've been half a head, maybe—the other half had been reduced to slag. \par
It was almost comical. Like he'd dropped a Lego army and all the pieces were scattered around. \par
He hadn't even touched them. They just got hit by the splash damage. Weren't these things like Level 90? He scratched his head. Was the Array calibrated wrong, or…\par
Class Skill Learned! \par
 Extinction Smash [Legendary] \par
 The meteors touch down with the force of an extinction event, doing devastating damage to all life nearby and leaving vast craters behind.\par


\section{111. Testing (I) }
\par
Zane touched down and wiped a line of soot off his face.\par
He looked at the mess he'd made. All the half-melted boulders strewn about, gaping open, showing their swirling lava cores. He smiled.\par
Yes. He liked this.\par
Still though...he scratched his head. It wouldn't do to go flying every time he threw a shot.\par
Cranking up Steely Density would help, sure. It'd anchor him some. But there had to be a way to control these Extinction Smashes too. He felt like he'd gone a little overboard on those last two—they took a good chunk of his essence. Unintentionally. But he could be intentional about it.\par
Maybe it could be like with Rising Storm Slash. He didn't need to go full bore every time. He could choose how much essence he put into it.\par
He'd get to give it a try very soon; fires dotted the plains again. Another wave was coming. Giant Magma Golems were spawning one by one, lumbering out of the blaze, lumbering at him, lava streaming down their joints, sputtering a fuming trail behind them. About a dozen on the left, a dozen on the right.\par
He gave his meteors a little yank, and a little lift of will. And they started hovering. It was unwieldy at first. But as he wiggled them around a little, guided them in little arcs, he got a feel for them. He was shocked how fast they moved. It wasn't smooth like how his axe flew—not at all. These things jerked around. It felt like lightly pressing the gas pedals on a fancy sports car and seeing it jump forward five yards. He had to be careful not to overdo it.\par
This time he aimed one meteor at the left half. One at the right. He chose a Golem in the middle of each pack so he got the rest in the splash zone.\par
He knew his meteors would be fast. But he still wasn't prepared when he let them loose. They shot out like cannonballs—these streaks of brilliant howling white, so bright they drowned out the world; they seared a stark after-image in Zane's retinas. It took some blinking to get it out.\par
Even with Steely Density turned all the way up, he still ended up staggering a step back. He felt the rush of scalding air, heard the blasts roar out—then he saw them.\par
He'd thrown these things with about half the essence as before.\par
Still way overkill.\par
The Golems he'd struck were gone. There were little puddles where they used to be—puddles quickly evaporating. The other Golems were a little more lucky; you could still make out parts of them intact. A stump of a leg. A third of an arm. Something that could have been a torso if you squinted a little. Little fires smoldered everywhere.\par
That was just the blast. It took a little bit to find his meteors. They'd struck the target, broken through, and kept on going. They'd come to a halt about a quarter of a mile away. They'd left long black tracks as they skidded down the plains.\par
He blinked. Foundation really was different. And he didn't even have an Elemental Law in this thing. He didn't even have Stormfire in it yet!\par
The next wave was already coming, crawling out of new flames. He swung his meteors back around. He was getting the hang of it. The backswing was the slow bit. As soon as he locked on, he fired. And the meteors slingshotted out. A horde of golems got whited out. Like that.\par
Then everything died down. Even the spawning flames. Was that it?\par
Then the center of the battlefield came alive. Fire exploded out of the ground, shooting upwards, a wall towering so high it touched the burning sky.\par
And something enormous stepped out.\par
He knew something was up when what looked like a boulder skyscraper loomed out of the flames. Then he realized that was just one leg. When it touched down, it cracked the ground like an eggshell. Another leg came out, stomped down, and it felt like a minor earthquake. A black-stone torso, flat and big as a cliff, loomed over him, shadowing him totally—shadowing even the craters.Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\par
Then came the head, a rugged plateau haphazardly welded on top. Molten yellow veins snaked all over it. Its eyes were shining yellow tunnels. A reddish stone crown was fixed to its block of a head, and when it roared it sounded like an eruption. Fumes poured out of its fissure mouth, trickling for the sky. Lava drool leaked out too.\par
Pyroclast, the Igneous King\par
Essence Level 97\par
It saw him. Its brutal face curved into a frown. It raised a leg to step—\par
White scorched the air. There was a thundering blast. And it staggered back.\par
Half its face was now missing. In its place was a smoking, smoldering crater; it looked like its skull was caved in.\par
Zane hadn't even put that much into that shot. Just a feeler, really.\par
His meteor was looping back around now. Another cool thing—he didn't need to stop with every hit. He wheeled it back along his Chain and whipped it out again. And it took the rest of the Igneous King's face off.\par
He grinned. This was fun.\par
Once the meteor went through, he could swerve it back around, smash it again and keep going. He could do a kind of fluid assault this way. Building momentum as he went, pounding it until it was dust.\par
He was quite glad he took the time to warm up. He was learning a lot.\par
The thing wasn't dead. It didn't seem to need a head to function. Now it was bending over, clenching a mountain of a fist. It seemed to want to bury him under it.\par
So he loaded another of his meteors. Both this time.\par
Two shooting stars took flight—and socked the giant in the chest.\par
Then it was like seeing one of those volcanic explosions so violent it tore the whole mountain apart. Chunks of rock streaked everywhere—little mini-shooting stars, trailing debris. The giant's hand came apart right over his head. And its thumb shot down and struck him and crumbled into a thousand little boulders. Boulders that thudded all over Zane, shattering over his body, blocking out all light.\par
It took a while for the rumbling to stop. Then there was silence.\par
He had to shove his way out to daylight, coughing a little. He looked to be in the middle of an ashen mountain range—the broken-off remains of massive limbs. That was the first time he'd gotten hit, he realized, and it was by friendly fire.\par
He felt something new sitting within. A little extra trickle of power, just waiting… was this that 'Wish Upon A Star' Skill? The one that let him reuse the damage he took, like payback? He couldn't use it right now. He had to fill it up first. He needed to take more damage.\par
Then the scene before him started fading away. Dissolving like he was waking from a dream.\par
Layer One, Wrathful Inferno, has been cleared. Kill Count: 100\par
He blinked. When he opened his eyes, he was somewhere else.\par
Before him lay an ocean. Above there was a full moon. The waters were inky black and still, mirror-clear. The sky melted seamlessly into the sea, like you were stuck in some unfathomably big sphere. A white path of moonlight stretched over it, heading for the horizon. A bowl of stars winked above him.\par
He was standing on a little barren island. All was quiet.\par
Then the water started to ripple, shudder, slosh all over with waves. And oil-black tentacles burst out of the water, rearing like pythons.\par
In a blink he was surrounded.\par
They lashed at him, snatching up his arms, his legs, coiling around. Their suction cups had some bite to them but they couldn't get under his skin. They tugged insistently, tried yanking him away. But with Steely Density cranked up, they couldn't do that either. They had him pretty well trussed up though.\par
Shadow Kraken\par
Essence Level 95\par
He saw a dozen red dots circling him on his mini-map.\par
Then they started blasting. Dark essence shot up the tentacles, slapping all over him. It burned a little, but that was all—like having alcohol rubbed on a wound or something. It wasn't doing all that much. He was hoping they'd get some good shots in so he could load up his new Skill. But at this rate he'd be here forever.\par
So he just brought out his meteors.\par
He held them up high. And slowly started loading them with power. They felt heavier the more he shoved in. But after a few go-arounds, it was starting to feel natural moving them around. They were really seething now, all bloated up with essence; he could still hold them in place.\par
Skill up!\par
Chain Mastery III -> IV\par
Now there were three heavenly bodies in the sky. Two black suns shrouded in burning white. And one white moon in a sea of inky black. Seeing them side-by-side tickled his brain.\par
Zane dug his feet in, tensed his arms, and flexed. Hard. His arms wrenched forward, coming together—and with them came the tentacles. And the Krakens exploded out of the water.\par
He saw them as giant Rorschach-blot things flying overhead, spitting ink everywhere; he caught a vague glimpse of one as it tumbled. A single giant watery eye, rows of bone-white teeth. It clumped in with the rest of its buddies in a writhing whirlpool mess.\par
Then the suns fell out of the sky.\par
It was like watching a time-lapse of a sunset, but there was no peaceful sinking beneath the horizon. The moment they touched water, every red dot on his mini-map vanished.\par
So did several swimming pools' worth of water.\par
Then it felt like he'd been thrown into some weird tropical hurricane; he was swamped in a mess of swirling, shrieking steam, a sudden tornado racing for the skies. When it cleared—enough to see, anyway—he made out water crashing all over the place. The sea rushed in to fill the void; it overflowed the edges, flooded up his little island, and drenched him in spray.\par
Skill up!\par
Extinction Smash I -> II\par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 100 -> 101\par


\section{112. Testing (II) }
\par
He wasn't sure how much faster his Skill Leveling had gotten in here. When was the last time he Leveled two Skills in a row? He couldn’t even remember.\par
He wondered if they were based on kills. That'd be nice. The splash damage was very convenient.\par
He figured he was pretty well suited to do well in this kind of thing; he could womp a chunk of them at once—and he could soak a lot of damage too. He could just keep chugging.\par
As he was musing, more Monsters were closing in. A red noose drawing tighter and tighter on his mini-map.\par
He got to work.\par
He chucked one meteor left, one meteor right. It was so steamy he couldn't see all that much; he went off the mini-map. It felt like playing an arcade game. Like whack-a-mole. Except every time he landed, every mole in a thirty-foot radius also got whacked.\par
More steam swarmed the air, thickening until he could hardly see his hands.\par
One more wave and all went quiet.\par
Seemed like final boss time.\par
The veil of mists started lifting; the sea sloshed to an uneasy calm.\par
He held up his meteors, loading them with essence. Just waiting.\par
There was a disturbance in the water.\par
A trembling. Currents started swirling; a big patch of ocean caved in. It swirled deeper and deeper, widening fast. Soon it was so big it could swallow a cruise ship; it sent violent waves scattering all around. That maw went deep—so deep he couldn't make out the bottom.\par
Kind of silly, in Zane's opinion. It told Zane exactly where to put his meteors.\par
It was like throwing a lantern down a deep, dark well. As it fell, the light filtered through the water, a sphere of light marking out everything solid in black silhouettes.\par
Were those dots schools of fish? He even made out silhouettes of shark-like things swept up in the current.\par
But the tentacles running beside them dwarfed them all. The deeper the light fell, the more there were, a great tangling forest of them.\par
Kraken of the Lightless Depths\par
Essence Level 99\par
Then—after a surprisingly long fall—his meteors struck the bottom.\par
There was a muffled THUNK.\par
Then the light flared so bright it felt like it lit up half the ocean.\par
Steam shot out of the Whirlpool in a pillar-straight funnel, spitting out a new cloud layer.\par
The tentacles went limp. The ocean collapsed back in on itself; the sloshing grew violent. Waves tall as city skylines raced over the surface. But before they could touch him—\par
Layer Two, Lightless Depths, has been cleared. Kill Count: 200\par
He blinked. And he was somewhere else.\par
That was it? ...Huh.\par
He thought it'd be harder.\par
Eh. He'd take the Skill experience anyway.\par
He stood on a high barren plateau, run through with deep cracks. Black sagging clouds dominated the sky, crackling with streaks of lightning. He looked around—the plateau fell steeply away into lifeless valleys that stretched to the far distance. Harsh winds ripped all around, fluttering his hair, buffeting his ears, making a ghostly shriek.\par
Then he saw them coming—a cloud of deep green specks.\par
Gale Wyvern\par
Essence Level 97\par
They looked like dragons, but meaner, with bright slitted yellow eyes. Their bodies were coated in deep-green scales. The main thing that concerned Zane was the wings.\par
…Birds?\par
He frowned.\par
The Wyverns shrieked. And folded their wings so they looked like giant sleek missiles. And dive-bombed him.\par
His meteors rose to meet them. Just as fast.\par
And two circles of brilliant fire erased the cloud of green.\par
When the circles vanished, all that was left was blackened wings, burnt-off tails streaking to earth, trailing wisps of smoke.\par
Zane blinked. Then he started to relax. He smiled.\par
Yes. This was very, very good. So he could now defend against birds. This pleased him greatly.\par
The next waves that came for him, he just waited for them to dive and exploded them one by one. He let himself enjoy the simple pleasure of smushing birds. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\par
Ahh...\par
It was a philosophical thing. Zane had always believed birds were bullshit and what they did shouldn’t work. Now he was proving it.\par
It was kind of weird, now he thought about it, how easily he was one-shotting whole hordes of Level 97s. Things really changed fast. Just a few days ago Monsters like that Bark Sentinel Overlord had given him a solid fight. Now he swatted Monsters like that out of the air like flies.The story has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.\par
Then there was a silence. The birds weren't coming anymore.\par
Which meant the boss was coming. The biggest of the birds, he guessed. It didn’t matter. He was ready to teach it a lesson.\par
He saw the dot coming closer, but no Monster. Then he looked up.\par
There was a flash of lightning. And for a split-second a shape came into view. The silhouette of a dragon.\par
Then it broke through the clouds, and he saw it in color.\par
It was armored in thick emerald-green scales; curving white spikes ran up its back. Its eyes were set deep in a gaunt skull. Lightning laced the smoke that drifted out its nostrils, and when it shrieked gale force winds poured out of its mouth, puncturing the clouds.\par
It was huge—leanly muscled, but very long and lanky; most of its size was its wings. They were like ship sails billowing to either side of it; strange currents bore them up. Current spurred by reams of Elemental Law.\par
Gale Dragon\par
Essence Level 103\par
Zane let out a breath. Time to get serious. This could be just the challenge he needed. He still had that one last Skill to test…\par
The dragon opened its crystal-studded mouth. A rumbling echoed up its throat; he saw its mouth fill up with blinding light—\par
Then a thunderstorm raged out of it. A scything, swirling glut of wind laced with vicious streaks of lightning. It came so fast Zane barely had time to react.\par
He had the wherewithal to turn up Steely Density. Then he took the blast straight to the face.\par
He'd braced for it and it still sent him staggering. It nearly forced him to his knees.\par
It was the Elemental Wind—the sheer force of it crushed down from above. It drove him a foot into the stony ground. And he just kept sinking, inch by inch. Nasty cuts started flaring up all over him. Up his arms, down his legs—that Wind couldn't cut deep. But it sure cut wide. In seconds he looked like he'd been mauled by some feral animal.\par
He gritted his teeth, stood there, and waited. It was shredding him up pretty bad—the streaming winds sent his blood streaking all over; it was painting him in his own blood.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%!\par
Then the lightning struck.\par
It lanced through his Steel body; his muscles all flexed at once—against his will. He hissed. Steel could block out many things, but against Electricity it hurt him if anything—that Lightning was seething with Law. It slapped away his own Electricity Laws; it tore straight into his organs, roasting him from the inside…\par
But he was smiling—and not just because his jaw was locked tight. Because all the while, he felt the tank in him slowly filling. And filling…\par
And soon--\par
Warning!\par
Health under 50\%!\par
Savage Body activated\par
Vitality increased 25\%!\par
Speed increased 25\% \par
Strength increased 25\% \par
But then his tank was full.\par
A few more harrowing seconds and the wind started dying down. It flapped there, breathing heavy, scowling at him. It'd burned itself out.\par
He stood there heaving too.\par
That shot would've made him meat paste just a day ago. Right now—though he was bleeding rivers, and his skin was soaked in blood all over, it wasn't anything as bad as it looked. His new Steel Body stopped the worst of the cuts skin deep. Ghostly flames danced over them, quickly patching them up…\par
Skill up!\par
Fiery Renewal II -> III\par
My turn.\par
Zane stood up straight, spat the blood out his mouth, and licked his split lips.\par
Then he summoned his meteors.\par
They were fuming, boiling over with white-hot essence; they let out a high-pitched sound like they were leaking essence. They were shaking like they were about to explode; he could hardly hold them up. It was all he could do to point them the right way.\par
Then he let them loose. Shooting stars raced for the dragon.\par
It had been eyeing them the whole time. It'd snorted its contempt; little crackling thunderclouds trickled out its nostrils.\par
It brought its wings together and a swirling cloudy vortex bloomed midair, a shield thick with Wind and Lightning—\par
The stars sank through it. It tore like tissue paper.\par
They sank through the dragon's scaly wings; there was a massive CRACK, the sounds of dozens of lanky bones crushed at once.\par
Then, at last, they sank through the Monster's body.\par
Seeing something that big spit blood was a sight to behold. A crimson geyser shot out its gullet. Its eyes bulged as it hacked. There were two huge smoking craters in its caved-in chest. It was so caved-in Zane would be shocked if a single organ lay intact in there. The kind of caved-in where he was kind of shocked it was still alive.\par
He felt fear and pain spiking in the great beast. It howled, turned tail, tried flapping its pulped-up, torn-up wings. A fresh current of Wind Law spun up at its tail, threatening to carry it away. Zane frowned. What a bird thing to do.\par
Where do you think you're going?\par
Then its eyes bulged, and it choked.\par
Something black was coiled around its neck. A stern Chain collar—and at its end, holding it down, was a stupidly heavy ball of molten steel.\par
He put both hands on the Chain and yanked. A full-body, full-force heave.\par
And the choking dragon came crashing down to earth. It landed face-first in a plume of dust; it made its own new crater. It tried getting back up, tried flapping its way to its feet, hacking heavily. But it couldn’t get up. No matter what it did, it was like its head was stapled to the ground.\par
Zane's Chains were already incredibly heavy. Especially stretched this long. Now with his meteor hammer as the ultimate anchor—forget about it! If this thing wanted to get away it would have to saw its own head off.\par
The dragon couldn't seem to believe it. Or maybe it was just desperate. It strained and heaved mightily; it stomped and flapped for all it was worth. Elemental Wind blasted at the Chains too, trying to shake them loose, trying to give it lift.\par
It managed to budge all of a foot.\par
Then Zane was all over it. He had something new he wanted to try out for things that just wouldn't hold still, like birds. And this one was a scaly bird after all; in the end it revealed its true nature. He frowned at it, watching it scrabble and thrash, and shook his head. It just looked ridiculous. Way too long and thin. No meat on its bones—now look at it, once he had it all tied up. What could it do? That was the problem with these birds. You could only run for so long.\par
Anyway. His new anti-bird strategy. ‘Ground and pound.’\par
One Chain to hold it down. The other swerves up high. Like a blacksmith hammering a chunk of metal. Except he wasn’t trying to make a pretty sword or something; he’d just hammer until the thing stopped twitching.\par
The dragon could only watch with one trembling eye as the meteor came down on its head.\par
CRUNCH. BOOM!\par
As it swung back for a second go-around, Zane inspected the damage. Its head was pretty shoved in. Those scales must be really hard; they were cracked. Not yet shattered.\par
Then he gave it another good smash. BOOM!\par
There we go. Now it was shattered, and badly. The thing's head was pushed in even more; it was half as wide as before, and you couldn't really make out the individual features anymore. It looked like a blackened lump of coal. At some point its massive eye had ruptured. Little oozing chunks of it were splattered everywhere.\par
Still alive, though. It couldn't voice its displeasure about this whole thing, what with that collar cutting off all airflow—all it could do was wheeze. But its tail was thrashing up a storm.\par
Zane felt kind of bad now. He hadn't expected it to work this well—this thing was Level 103! Shouldn't it fight back better? He supposed it was kind of hard to fight when your best weapon came out of your throat. And its throat had a few mountains of weight pressing down on it.\par
One last crash. And the thing went still.\par
Skill up!\par
Extinction Smash II -> III\par
Level up! \par
Essence Level 101 -> 102\par
Layer 3 Windswept Wildlands has been cleared. Kill Count: 300\par
Hey, nice. He felt pumped. Ready for the next one.\par
The scene dissolved. He got just a glimpse of the next layer—what looked to be a desert. Cacti sprouted about. Two suns baked high above…\par
But just then—\par
30 minutes has elapsed. The run has concluded.\par
Final Kill Count: 300\par
Aww.\par
Next time.\par


\section{113. Cliff Face}
\par
For Cain Hastings, it’d been easy transitioning to the Change. \par
Of course it’d been. He'd been the undefeated heavyweight boxing champion of the world! They called him the 'Lion of Manchester.' Part of it was his lustrous golden mane and rather impressive handlebar mustache, if he did say so himself. Part of it was how he fought—always stalking forward, supremely confident. Always with a winning smile.\par
He’d been in the middle of thrashing some American chump in front a raucous home crowd when the Change struck—and the stadium was trapped in a zombie nightmare. He'd beaten his way out with his own two fists! His Faction, the Knights Templar, soon had the run of the British Isles. From there he went from glory to glory. Besting the cliffs of Dover. Routing the terrors at Loch Ness! He'd been beloved before. But now he was Britain’s great hero.\par
Then it'd all gone horribly wrong.\par
It started when he challenged Irina Volkova to a friendly duel. A duel he'd loudly advertised—a duel on home soil with tens of thousands of his biggest fans in attendance. It was meant to cement him as the best in the world.\par
Instead it was the worst humiliation of his life. \par
It wasn't only that he lost the fight. It was how. She'd toyed with him. Frozen him physically and mentally. He was literally an ice cube by the end of it—frozen spread-eagled in some clownish pose. As he lay stuck there, struggling desperately to break free, he'd caught sight of his heartbroken fans lining up to leave the stadium. He watched them give up on him one by one.\par
When he got home, he found his men were putting away the balloons when he came back to the castle, scrubbing the paint off the wall—‘CONGRATULATIONS! STILL UNDEFEATED! STILL OUR LION!' One last twist of the knife—they’d had such faith in him they’d already set up the victory party. Now none of them would meet his eyes.\par
That night—well, he may have shed a tear or two.\par
Alright. If he was perfectly honest, he sobbed all night. He hid away in his chambers after that, drowning in the shame of it. It wasn't just the shame, either—for the first time in his life, his confidence had been brutally and extremely publicly shattered.\par
So he wasn't the best in the world. Not even close. Why, Volkova practically made him look second-rate! When he was in that ring… he felt like he was staring up a sheer cliff with no handholds. A cliff that went up so high he couldn't see where it ended.\par
He moped for weeks on end. Eating little, sleeping even less. He grew haggard, disheveled. His mustache drooped listlessly.\par
Until one day, he decided…No.\par
This would not be the end of Cain Hastings!\par
He picked himself back up. For the first time in weeks, he waxed his mustache—it hadn't lost that fearsome quiver, he was pleased to see! He took up his gauntlets once more and went out into the world.\par
True champions got back up. He'd prove that fight was a fluke. He'd claim his mantle again. It was time for his great redemption! He came out with fire in his belly and started training harder than ever. It was what brought him to VGI.\par
…Except since then, he was still getting passed up!\par
He'd been World Rank \#6 once. Then that sleepy Yuki boy passed him by. So did that Brazilian menace, Dos Santos. And Mike Masters too! He'd slid to a piddling 9th place.\par
It felt like every week a new prodigy was breaking through the Foundation. Popping up like weeds! Just last week, some girl in a hoodie he'd never heard of. Now this 'Zane Walker' was the talk of town.\par
Life lately felt like some devilish treadmill—the faster he ran, the faster it went. He was trying, damn it all! He felt like pulling his hair out.\par
Sometimes—in certain dark, vulnerable moments—he was wracked with a horrible fear. That there was nothing he could do; that there was simply an insurmountable gulf between him and the true elites of the world… how else could you explain it? He kept sliding and sliding…\par
He snorted, mustache quivering. “Nonsense!” he cried. He was a champion, and a champion never gave up on himself. The world might’ve written him off. To hell with them! It'd only be that much sweeter when he took back his throne.\par
***\par
"…That much sweeter when I take back my throne!" Cain harrumphed.\par
His butler Adam nodded. "Yes, sir. Of course, sir."\par
They were ambling down the main road on their way to morning practice.\par
There was a crowd off to the left. Cain frowned at it. It circled the Asura Hell Array. Was that madman Eze having another go at it? That man… something about him made Cain nervous. He reminded Cain altogether too much of Volkova. They were nothing alike in personality besides the brutal competitiveness. Just that same disturbing feeling—like looking up a sheer cliff. He shuddered and tried thinking of other things.Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.\par
"What's got them so fussed, anyway?" He grumbled.\par
The crowd were all looking at the portal, whispering heavily. He caught the name 'Zane Walker.'\par
Zane Walker. They spoke of him in such hushed, awed tones. He remembered when they used to speak of him that way. But ever since that Volkova loss…he felt a prickling of sourness.\par
“That Walker lad’s giving it a go?" he said casually.\par
"Seems so."\par
"Say—do you believe the story they're telling? That he broke through in thirteen hours? Bit far-fetched, isn't it?"\par
Adam hesitated, looking carefully at his face. "I'm… not certain, sir. Err—there were many eyewitnesses."\par
“People say all kinds of nonsense.”\par
"I don't know, sir."\par
"You think he's about to pass me up too?" Cain chuckled. "Am I about to be ranked number ten—reduced to double digits? Knocked down to fourth on the Asura Hell leaderboards, perhaps?" There was an odd and highly unpleasant churning in his gut.\par
"Err—"\par
“Of course not. Preposterous!” He blustered.\par
"You think so, sir?"\par
"What else would you have me believe? I took twenty-six hours to break through! What—that this 'Zane Walker' ’s twice as fast as I am?" Cain snorted. "Please. Why—if that were true, I might as well give up here and now!”\par
He chuckled. Adam stayed silent. His heart sank. "…Adam?"\par
"Err—" said Adam again quickly. His butler swallowed. “Yes! Perhaps there's another explanation, sir."\par
“Oh?”\par
"I hear he's conquered some demonic Faction and gotten their inheritance. Certain forbidden Skills let you trade chunks of your soul—perhaps even your powers—to break through bottlenecks…"\par
Cain stared at him. Then he was flooded with relief; he let out a big belly laugh. "By God, man—now you’ve said it, it's obvious! Of course! What else could it be?”\par
He'd gotten scared for a second there. Imagine if there really was such a monster...\par
He stroked his mustache. “Youngsters these days, with their shortcuts! But at what cost? There's always a price to pay."\par
He nodded, chuckling. "Let him have his day in the sun! But it's like that old story, eh? The tortoise and the hare. The tortoise and the hare!” \par
"Yes, sir," said Adam, smiling nervously. "Very wise, sir."\par
***\par
Soon the portal started swirling faster and faster, and gasps rang out in the crowd.\par
"Seems our man’s about to come out," mused Cain.\par
But he wasn't looking at the portal. He was staring straight at his own name on the leaderboard, and his heart was hammering. Zane Walker had only just broken through to Foundation! Surely not… right?\par
Then a new name joined the pack. And Cain's breath caught.\par
Zane Walker\par
300 Kills\par
He was stunned. They all were; the crowd exploded in whispers.\par
As they should! For Foundation fighters, 300 kills was—why, it was downright mediocre! Every top Ranker was a great talent; every great talent should be able to fight well above their Level. 300 kills meant Zane barely survived the third layer. Dare he say—a humiliating performance?\par
Cain let out a broad grin. Then he laughed; he couldn't help it—he was just so relieved. Yes—always a price to pay, a price to pay indeed!\par
Did he feel rather bad about feeling so relieved? Yes. Did he feel relieved anyway? Also yes.\par
The man himself, Zane Walker, stepped out of the portal. And on a whim, Cain strode out to greet him. The crowd parted before him. "Zane Walker! The man of the hour," he chuckled. Damn, but he was a big lad up close. Cain easily cleared six feet, and he had a muscular frame too. But Zane dwarfed him. Cain had to look up to meet his eyes. Still, he put on an easy grin. \par
"Pity about that kill count, eh? Chin up, lad! Let this be a lesson to you. You do things the right way or you'll pay for it. It's tempting to cut corners. But a solid foundation's what separates the champions from the chaff! Take it from me.” \par
He gave the man a pat on the back and a winning smile.\par
Zane looked baffled. So did the rest of the crowd, for some reason.\par
Cain looked around, blinking. What was going on? He got the odd feeling he was missing something. Something rather important.\par
The operator cleared her throat. "As requested, Mister Walker, I ended your run early."\par
Cain froze. \par
"Your final run statistics are: 300 kills in 30 minutes."\par
There was a long, dead silence.\par
"Err," said Cain. His voice came out strangely high-pitched. He gave a nervous chuckle. "Pardon me, miss—I seem to have misheard. This will sound ridiculous, I realize—but I heard you say ‘300 kills in 30 minutes.'"\par
"I did say that," said the operator lady.\par
"300 kills. In 30 minutes."\par
"That's right."\par
"30 minutes!"\par
"Yes."\par
There was a hollow ringing sound in his head. He couldn’t seem to stick two thoughts together. His mouth felt very, very dry. \par
"Thanks for the advice," Zane said blandly. He turned to walk away.\par
"Wait!" croaked Cain. “Halt! What did you do?!”\par
"What?"\par
"You've—you've done a deal with the devil! You've sold your soul—your powers! What is it?! Tell me!" They were all staring at him like he'd gone mad.\par
Zane didn't seem to understand. "What?"\par
"How did you break through?!"\par
"…I just sat down and did it." Zane said, blinking. "It wasn't hard."\par
A long, painful pause.\par
"…Ah."\par
Then Cain got a very familiar feeling.\par
Like he was staring up a sheer cliff. He felt rather dizzy all of a sudden.\par
Zane scratched his head and left.\par
***\par
Well, that was weird.\par
Anyway.\par
The last thing Zane did before he set off was to take another couple droplets of Essence of Morning Dew. He squeezed out just enough soul power to make one last Skill upgrade.\par
Skill evolved!\par
Extinction Smash (Legendary) -> Apocalypse Smash (Mythic)\par
This one he was happy testing on the battlefield.\par
He set off around noon. He expected to be back for dinner. Time to wipe out the Number 2 Faction in America.\par


\section{114. Tomb Kings (I) }
\par
Three weeks ago...\par
A full moon shone over a desolate mountain peak. A peak so high it loomed far above the restless churning clouds.\par
A man stood atop it—a broad-shouldered man with strong features and short white hair. His eyes were trained on the sky.\par
They glowed an unearthly bright blue.\par
He held a beautiful obsidian sword, a sword thrust skyward. From its tip flowed a stream of shifting shadows—shadows cast on thin air.\par
They flowed into a Monster.\par
The Earth Dragon Kyron — the dungeon's Level 100 Boss—floated before him. Its scales were the color of weathered stone. Its steel-silver eyes glowed just as his did.\par
For a moment, all was still. The man and the dragon stared at each other, locked in some unseen duel.\par
Then the dragon snorted; its whole body started quivering. Suddenly it seemed very agitated; its face curled up in a look of immense pain. It gave a strangled cry.\par
Its eyes rolled back. Blood leaked out the sockets, leaked out its mouth—and it plummeted. It broke through the clouds and was gone.\par
The man got a notification.\par
B+ rank dungeon Earth Dragon Sanctuary has been cleared!\par
For a moment, he stood there silent. Then he frowned. He patted his suit's breast pocket, pulled out a crystal, held it up to his ear.\par
We finished the interrogations. The account was corroborated by five witnesses at the Abyssal Crater. It was as you suspected, sir. It wasn't the Ice Princess. Someone else intervened.\par
The man stilled.\par
Zane Walker. The Savage Sage.\par
His expression spasmed. For a moment, rage flickered across his features.\par
"Thank you, Gabriel," he said.\par
Then in silence, he looked at the stars.\par
"We found your killer, Javi," he said softly. His voice began to tremble; it grew thick with feeling.\par
For now, he was still Level 99. He was not yet strong enough to sweep the West Coast… \par
But soon. His breakthrough was coming.\par
Soon—“Brother, I will avenge you!”  \par
***\par
Modern Day \par
Sunset\par
Zane stood at the border of Silicon Coven territory and waited in a field of sagging knee-tall yellow grass. They went on and on, stretching into the horizon, swaying softly in the breeze.\par
It wasn't long before he saw them.\par
They popped up on his mini-map first—a clump of seven white dots. Then he saw their auras—a glut of black essence sweeping toward him like a low, bleak fog.\par
Seven men. All in expensive-looking sleek black suits. Six in a row behind—the clear leader headed the pack. Soon he was close enough to identify.\par
Mike Masters \par
Essence Level 106\par
Signature Title: Dark Knight\par
Mike saw him in turn—and froze. His eyes widened. A spasm ran over his face.\par
Then Zane felt an outpouring of fury. So much he was taken aback.\par
But Mike didn't let it show on his face. Instead he put on a strained smile. "Zane Walker," he said softly. "Perhaps this is fate." \par
What? \par
"My name is Mike Masters." He bowed deeply, to his waist. "I lead the Tomb Kings. And these are my Marquises."\par
He gestured to the men behind him—all dark-haired, well slicked; they were a well-groomed bunch. Each of them was in the high Level 90s.\par
And each of them also felt very angry at Zane.\par
"I've known each of these men for well over a decade. Some since we were children…we are like family. There used to be more of us. But a few have passed on as of late." \par
Uh…\par
"One in particular—Javier Mendez—I think of every day," said Mike. His eyes started misting a little. "Javi and I… it is difficult for me to tell you how close we were. He was like a little brother to me. Tell me. Why did you kill him?"\par
"Oh." Zane scratched his head. Well—this was kind of awkward. He wondered how the guy found out. "I saw him trying to kill someone. So he tried to kill me. So I killed him back."If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.\par
It took a moment for that to sink in. Then Mike closed his eyes, breathed out heavily, nodded slowly. “That makes sense. It would not have done to leave witnesses." He sighed. "His hand was forced. And yours was forced in turn. You cannot be blamed for that." \par
What a surprisingly reasonable thing to say.\par
"I know this in my head," Mike continued. "But… I'm afraid my heart does not agree."\par
He held out his own hand, and a sword dropped into it, smoking shadows—a beautiful thing. He shook his head sadly. "Today we must duel to the death, Zane Walker.” \par
This wasn't really how Zane thought things would go down. This Mike seemed like a chill guy—other than being a murderous mob boss and everything. Right now he was just a guy looking out for his friend—Zane could understand that. He was even polite about it. Now Zane felt kind of bad about the whole thing. \par
"Uh," he said, scratching his head. “You know. We don’t have to fight, if you don’t want to.” Which were words he never thought he’d say. "We can all just go home and forget about it.” \par
He felt he should give the poor guy a way out. \par
But at that Mike's anger spiked. His face spasmed—he had to close his eyes, take a deep breath or two.\par
"No. This will end only one way." His men nodded behind him. "You do not understand. Each of us—we are like brothers. Each of these men is like a part of my own heart! Gabriel, Hector, Liam, Jeremy, Paul, Antonio…" he started choking up a little. Zane could feel he really meant it. "How can you ask me to simply forget the killing of a brother?"\par
Yeah… Zane supposed that did make sense. He'd be pretty mad if someone tried to kill Evan or something too.\par
"… Alright…" Nothing to be done for it, Zane supposed… they just really wanted to kill him. \par
What a weird situation. \par
Mike leveled his sword at him. Zane didn't need Sage Mind to tell his feelings. His posture exuded confidence. \par
"Have you made peace, Savage Sage?" He called. His aura began to rise. "Are you ready?"\par
They were starting?\par
“Not yet," Zane said. He turned up Sage Mind's in-depth Identify.\par
Mike Masters \par
Essence Level 106\par
Signature Title: Dark Knight\par
Class: Shade Paladin \par
Key Laws:\par
Elemental Law of Darkness\par
Key Skills:\par
Nocturne Soul (Passive) [Signature Skill]\par
In exchange for a 15\% reduction in power during the daytime, the wielder's powers became 30\% stronger at night. This Skill does not Level.\par
Dark Night of the Soul (Active) [Signature Skill]\par
Locks the enemy in a duel to the death in the astral plane, where one’s capabilities are directly proportional to one’s soul power. A high-risk, high-reward Skill. Best used as a last resort. \par
Slash of the Endless Void (Active) [Legendary]\par
An enormously powerful slash which voids all resistance, crushing Law and Essence. \par
Shade Walking (Active) [Legendary]\par
Grants the wielder the power to step into any darkness in a general radius and re-emerge at any other darkness. \par
A few things stood out to Zane. That slash Skill sounded like it could be a doozy. And he didn't even know what that soul Skill meant, but it seemed unpleasant. And if Mike got extra powerful at night... the sun was most of the way down the horizon. Then there was that teleporting skill too. That… could be some trouble.\par
He half-expected the guy to jump him while he was inspecting. But Mike just waited there politely. What a nice guy. It really was kind of a pity Mike wanted to kill him so badly. Then—"Alright. I'm good."\par
Mike nodded. "Then let us begin." He turned his head skyward. "For Javi," he whispered. "For brotherhood!"\par
"For brotherhood!" roared the Marquises. \par
Mike's aura exploded. So did those of the Marquises—but Mike's overshadowed them all.\par
Damn! That night Skill was stronger than he’d thought. He could instantly tell Mike was the strongest being he'd ever met—he felt a lot stronger than even that Gale Dragon. Zane had to get serious. \par
He brought out his own best weapon. Mike was readying a Slash; his sword was a smoldering pyre of darkness. A dark so dark it made the night seem pale by contrast—a smothering, domineering, absolute darkness, a gaping void of an element. \par
Zane's meteors burst into being, blazing high above. Stormfire brought their brightness to another level; it was like the sun had come out, washing away the night.\par
Mike stared at it—Zane felt a spike of shock. He got the sense the man hadn't expected Zane to pull out enough essence to match his own, much less exceed it. \par
Then Zane brought the hammer down. Apocalypse Smash! \par
The sun fell out of the sky.\par
Mike's eyes widened; he gritted his teeth, let out a roar—and unleashed an arc of smoking inky darkness. \par
An arc of black met a line of white.\par
The eruption was spectacular; a wave of blinding essence torched the world. And to Zane's surprise, his smash was knocked off-course—just how much essence was in that thing? It cratered to a halt a dozen odd feet away.\par
When Zane blinked the light out of his eyes, fires spread everywhere. Every strand of grass in a hundred foot radius had been reduced to ash; the rocky ground was charred black.\par
Mike was breathing heavy. There were a few black, sizzling spots on his face where he'd been scorched pretty good—and his suit looked a lot shabbier for wear. But he'd come out of it mostly fine.\par
It really said more about how strong Mike was than about his new Stormfire Skill—he could tell it was monstrous just by that splash damage. Pretty much everything without an Elemental Law protecting it had gone to dust.\par
Then he frowned. Wait. Where'd all the Marquises gone?\par
Then he noticed the six piles of ash smoldering behind Mike. … Ah. Oops. \par
He hadn't even meant to do that. The blast really was stronger than he'd thought… \par
Then Mike saw where he was looking—and turned. He saw the first pile of ash, and gasped. "No..." He whispered. "NO!"\par
For a second he just stood there in shock. Then he sank slowly to his knees.\par
He reached out a trembling hand, grasped a handful of dust—it slipped between his fingers. "Gabriel!" He croaked. He turned—and saw the next ash pile. He choked. "Hector!" Then the next, and the next—"Liam! Jeremy! Paul! ANTONIO!"\par
Well. This… this was very awkward. Zane stood there shuffling his feet.\par
He knew they'd been trying to kill him, but he still felt kind of bad about it.\par
Mike buried his face in his hands. He started to sob. Zane just stood there, scratching his head. He wasn't really sure what to do now.\par
Zane supposed they were doing a little break now—he tried to be respectful. He waited patiently for the guy to finish up.\par
Man—Mike was still tearing up. He must've really liked those guys…\par
…Could he actually tell those piles of ashes apart, or was he just guessing? They looked the same to Zane…\par
After a while, Mike finished up. He looked up again, sniffling, eyes red.\par
Slowly, Mike turned. His face twisted. If he'd been angry before, well…." ZANE WALKER!"\par
"Uh," said Zane.\par
"YOU TOOK ALL MY BROTHERS FROM ME!"\par
"Yeah…" He felt kind of helpless. He did get why the guy was angry. But they did also insist on trying to kill him—they didn't give him much of a choice here, he felt like—\par
"I'LL KILL YOU!" Mike screeched, spittle flying, veins bulging purple on his forehead. And his aura exploded to new heights.\par
Oh dear.\par


\section{115. Tomb Kings (II) }
\par
Mike came at him like a rabid animal. "DIE!" he shrieked.\par
Zane, meanwhile, was still feeling bad about the whole thing. In Zane's head Mike was still just a poor sad guy.\par
In that moment it was easy to forget Mike Masters was ranked top ten in the world—and he'd already slain another top ten World Ranker. And he had four Levels on Zane. And he had all the powers of an Elemental Law—at the time of day it was at its strongest…\par
Mike screeched and struck. His sword raced out in a jagged arc. Darkness tore though the air. And Zane got a wake-up call.\par
Zane felt it coming and he still almost didn't react in time; the speed of dark came blink-fast, just like the speed of light.\par
He ducked. And the thick black crescent whipped overhead. He had to arch straight back to limbo under another—\par
Then Mike vanished. One moment he was there; the next he just wasn't. It wasn't a trick. Zane couldn't even feel his soul anymore. What…?\par
He felt it again a moment later. An eruption of hate—right behind him.\par
Before Zane could turn, Mike struck him.\par
He wasn't ready for how heavy it was. Or how deep it cut—a good inch into the muscle. Even with Steel Body he staggered a step. Pain flared up his back; he whirled around and felt another painful spike as his back muscles tore with the effort.\par
Zane stopped feeling bad.\par
What was that? Why'd his back feel so gunky, so heavy, like someone had strapped a weight on him? He glanced under his armpit, where the slash ended, heard a gushing sound—saw blood fountaining out of him. There was the culprit.\par
Elemental Darkness. His whole back was gushing blood. Normally it healed pretty fast—not right now. He saw the white flames of Fiery Renewal working furiously. But they were sputtering out. Darkness smothered them. It had this endless quality, deep as the night sky; it felt like a heavy wet blanket; it crushed his flames to nothing. The wound wouldn't stop bleeding.\par
Before he could think more on it Mike came roaring out of the darkness again, frothing at the mouth. He screamed with each slash—"DIE, DIE, DIE!" \par
This time Zane managed to throw up his Chains. Darkness poured over Stormfire—and broke against it. An explosion shuddered the air. He staggered back a step, then another as a second slash rained down on him, pouring inky blackness. The third came through just as vicious as the last—and this time he barely warded it off.\par
Why did it feel like he was getting weaker?\par
Then he blinked and saw why. Stormfire smoldered everywhere—except where those slashes landed. Elemental Darkness clung to his Chains, smothering everything.\par
He couldn't keep stumbling backward, playing defense—he had to strike back! An Apocalypse Smash whipped out—\par
And in a blink Mike was gone. He'd just melted into the night. Zane's meteor lit up the night, raced down the field, leaving a trail of blinding destruction. But none of it hit the guy.\par
Then another lance of pain ripped up his flank, and he hissed.\par
Damn! Every time he got hit, it felt like adding an extra ton to his body. Just clinging onto him. He whirled around just in time to block his slash, then another; Mike howled, eyes bulging wildly. When he just swung like this Zane could block him just fine. CLANG! CLANG!\par
But the moment he tried loading up a Smash the guy just vanished—blipped somewhere else. And the next moment Zane felt a burning up the back of his thigh. He turned, growling, smashing—the guy was gone.\par
Alright. Fine. \par
He closed his eyes, frowning, really focusing; Mike kept carving him up but he didn't care. He could tank a few of these—he just wanted to get one good shot in. Apocalypse Smash lay ready and loaded; he closed his eyes, soaking in the space, just waiting. The moment Mike poked out—\par
There!\par
Zane lashed out. At the same time, he felt pain streak up his belly; he didn't care. His meteor blitzed through the air—\par
And hit nothing. Again. He tore a gaping, smoldering crater in already ruined ground—but that was all.\par
Seriously? Still too slow!\par
Warning!\par
 Health under 75\%!\par
He took another slash and staggered, hissing. Damn, but the guy hit hard; now Zane was limping a little. Pain flared with each step.\par
He knew what the problem was.\par
The sun had set now. It wasn't just Mike's Signature Skill, which made him a lot stronger at night. Mike was teleporting with that shade-walking Skill—and since it was night, he was pretty much always in shade. It was too easy to get away.If you stumble upon this narrative on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
And when he was gone, Zane couldn't feel him. Even when he really focused. Sage Mind worked 'cause he could feel his opponent's attack before they struck; by the time it was in motion, it was just too late.\par
He frowned as he ate another shot, lunged at nothing—he felt pretty clumsy and silly doing it. The only bright side was his 'Wish Upon A Star' was halfway charged now. That was it. Otherwise he was kind of getting worked here.\par
This is stupid. \par
Zane frowned. No. No more of this 'closing his eyes, trying to time the guy' type of stuff. He knew what the problem under the problem was, too.\par
He was using his brain too much.\par
He went back to his tried-and-true motto. When in doubt, always use brute force.\par
His main problem, he thought—as he took a wound a little too close to his neck-veins—was that it was night-time.\par
So he threw up his Meteors. And opened the floodgates.\par
Just threw as much essence as he could bear into them; soon they shone pretty damned bright—but they still were nothing compared to the vastness of the dark.\par
Until he started Smashing. And Smashing. And Smashing.\par
Not at Mike. He couldn't hit Mike. Instead he smashed anywhere and everywhere. One on one side, one on the other, making big, happy, shining booms, torching the ground all around him, over and over. Soon it felt like an earthquake was shaking the battlefield. Stormfire raged through the air, crackling up a storm; spark-embers showered the plains, birthing new brilliant flames where they landed.\par
Zane did not care if the rest of the world thought it was nighttime. In Zane's opinion, it was only nighttime if he said so.\par
He just kept Smashing indiscriminately—even as Mike kept carving vicious cuts into him—down his chest, up his arms; the man was still going strong as ever—eyes red, frothing at the mouth, shrieking one long mournful note.\par
But the nice thing about being built big and thick was you had to cut him up pretty darn bad to actually bring him down.\par
In the meantime, Zane bombed the hell out of the whole battlefield. And now things looked plenty bright to him. Let's see where you hide now.\par
Sure enough, he heard a cry—"AARGH!"\par
He grinned.\par
He hadn't even caught the guy clean. Just splash damage. It still tore a good chunk out of him. Man, Zane loved explosions. Something about them just made his soul feel happy.\par
The idea was simple. If I can't hit you I am going to hit everything. You're part of everything. So I am going to hit you. \par
And he did. Again and again—cries of "AHHHH!" "HRNG!" "GAH!" echoed down the plains.\par
Now that he was hurting the guy—and making the battlefield a furnace—he'd expected Mike to slow down a little. Maybe step back, get out of range. Take a breather, you know.\par
But Mike was just too angry to care. Zane watched the guy lunge through a white-hot explosion—and eat the blast straight to the face. He flared up with pain, let out a howl—but barreled on through. And still almost slashed Zane's eyes out.\par
Honestly, he had the right idea. Even with his new trick Zane was still losing the battle of attrition.\par
He'd stumbled on this idea a little too late. He took a step and slipped on his own blood; he took another step, trying to steady himself, and almost went over. Since that patch was also stained red. Everything around him really. He blinked around… without Fiery Renewal to heal him, he'd leaked half a swimming pool, it looked like. He didn't even know he had that much blood inside of him.\par
Maybe that was why he felt so woozy…\par
Warning!\par

Then that tank of power—the one he'd been waiting for—filled up at last. And smiled.\par
This should even things up.\par
You could hardly spot anything that wasn't on fire anymore. The shadows were already few and far between—then Zane raised his Meteors to the sky.\par
He made a Wish Upon a Star.\par
Light burst out of him. His meteors started burning so bright, so hot, they were like twin rising suns; they lifted the veil of darkness, washed away the last few pockets of night—a shocked-looking Mike stumbled gasping out of a shrinking puddle of shadow.\par
Gotcha! \par
The explosion swallowed everything.\par
Chunks of dirt shot so high they touched the clouds; a wall of shining white swept the world…\par
He didn't even hear Mike's scream. He did feel a flare of Darkness—a desperate try at defense. He also felt his Stormfire smash through it like water through a dam. And feast on the flesh beneath…\par
Then there was silence.\par
By the time Zane could make out color again, the battlefield was one enormous crater sinking dozens of feet into the ground. So utterly destroyed not even Stormfire would take to the blackened ruin. Even the ash was scorched to hell; exhausted piles of it leaked into the sky.\par
And then there was Mike.\par
Still alive, surprisingly—coughing badly though. His Darkness couldn't save him. Just the splash damage had his skin melting off his bones. He was just one huge patch of raw flesh now, half-blackened, like meat ruined by an amateur cook.\par
But he still managed to stand somehow. Wheezing and stumbling, sure, but he did, through an effort of sheer will. He was in horrific pain. But his anger still burned hot as ever. That was the power of love, Zane supposed. Maybe hate? Probably a bit of both—\par
He let out one last strangled scream. And he lunged.\par
And their battle entered its final stretch. He slashed. Zane smashed. He carved through ruined knots of muscle. Zane's blasts tore whole chunks off Mike's body; he heard a CRACK!, saw a gnarled husk of a hand go flying—it'd been scorched so bad it looked like a Halloween decoration.\par
But by then, Zane's wounds were taking their toll too; his head felt awfully dizzy; his body was so weighed down by dark essence every step was a struggle. He was a little worried he might black out.\par
Warning!\par
 Health under 25\%!\par
But it was Mike who went down first.\par
He emerged out of a patch of shadow twenty feet out, dragging in big gulps of air. He was charred to the bone from the neck down; his body looked like what one of those ancient mummies might look like if you unwrapped it. He tried stepping, and his whole leg crumbled off beneath him, splitting off in three chunks—foot, shin, thigh.\par
Hobbling like a flamingo, he stared at them. Then at Zane.\par
And his hatred peaked one last time. With it came an animal desperation. A sinister intent was forming—he was on his last leg. Literally. He didn't care anymore. He was reaching for a Skill, Zane felt—something risky, something dangerous—Zane wracked his mind for what it could be.\par
But there was only one.\par
Dark Night of the Soul (Active) [Signature Skill]\par
Locks the enemy in a duel to the death in the astral plane, where one's capabilities are directly proportional to one's soul power. A high-risk, high-reward Skill. Best used as a last resort. \par
Uh…\par
"You may think you've won, Zane Walker," snarled Mike. "But our battle is only beginning!" \par
He cried out, thrust out his sword—and his eyes began to glow.\par
Darkness rushed out of it. But Zane just frowned at it. He didn't even dodge. One of those lines—\par
Where one's capabilities are directly proportional to one's soul power. \par
…Hmm.\par
Now—he had no experience in the astral plane or whatever. But he had a feeling he'd be just fine.\par
The shadows struck him straight in the chest. Tore through his soul-cloak resistance. And struck his soul flush.\par
Then his eyes, too, began to glow…\par
\par


\section{116. Tomb Kings (III) }
\par
Then it felt like he'd been shoved. Shoved so hard his whole world spun. He was violently flung away; he started falling, hurtling out of control. Nausea washed over him; not in his gut or in his head—not anywhere he was used to feeling it. Not anywhere physical. It went deeper than that, wrenching at his mind, at his soul.\par
The world became a slur of swirling colors.\par
Then slowly, everything righted itself again.\par
He blinked, trying to get the blurriness out of his eyes.\par
The first thing he noticed was how he felt. Or rather—what he didn't feel. His body had been one big cloud of pain.\par
Suddenly it was all gone. Along with every other sensation. No hot or cold; no smells, no prickling up and down his skin. Nothing; dead silence. You never really noticed how many background feelings there were—even something as simple as the feeling of your weight on the soles of your feet—until they were all taken away. Huh.\par
He felt all light and float-y.\par
He kept blinking. Then stilled. No matter how much he blinked, the blurriness stayed as it was. There was nothing in his eyes. Instead, it was like he was nearsighted; everything came in fuzzy.\par
Frowning, he looked around. Lots of black all over the place. There was a sky far above—it looked to be night. The moon looked like a bright smudge on a camera lens. He looked down. He seemed to be standing in some kind of smoking crater.\par
A very familiar smoking crater.\par
… Wasn't this the real world?\par
But no, not quite. It was smaller than he remembered.\par
Then he caught sight of something. And stilled.\par
Wait. Was that chunk of colors supposed to be him?\par
It was. Very blurry—and painted all over in gaping red wounds—but he knew what he looked like. His body was just standing there, slumped a little like it was about to keel over. With that posture, it should've been falling. But it wasn't. Like it was frozen in time.\par
The other weird thing. It was like a figurine, all scaled down. It only went up to Zane’s shins.\par
Then he noticed his shins were glowing with a soft golden light, like warm afternoon sunlight.\par
Funky.\par
So this was the astral plane, huh. Where he was meant to duel to the death. So he guessed that blur was his real body. And this weird glow-y body was meant to be his soul.\par
…Was everything scaled down, or was he just scaled up? He was remembering that line again, in the Skill description—something about your soul’s capabilities being proportional to its power…?\par
Well. He supposed his size made sense.\par
Then he glanced across the crater. And saw the only clear thing in the whole picture.\par
It was Mike Masters. He was glowing too—and his soul form looked exactly like he had before the fight. Only…his soul-body barely went up to like Zane's thigh. His features all looked the same—he was just smaller. From where Zane stood, he looked like a very old child.\par
For a few seconds, they just stared at each other. Mike seemed rather in shock.\par
A beat.\par
Then the guy’s face twisted in fury. “So you have the edge in soul!” he choked. “If you think you’ve won, you are a fool!”\par
Zane wasn't sure if it was just his 'ear'—or whatever the equivalent was in here—but it came out as a little squeaky sound. Maybe because the guy was so small?\par
“It is not the size of the dog in the fight, but the fight in the dog!” He was trembling a little. He seemed to be trying to convince himself, which was understandable, given the rather… big… difference. And it seemed to be working, weirdly. He was gaining confidence even as he spoke. “For I have something you shall never have. My brothers stay with me in spirit—blessing me with strength, even now!”\par
Zane felt him swell up with fighting spirit. “TODAY YOU DIE, ZANE WALKER!”\par
Then Mike charged, squeaking a battle cry, fists swinging.\par
This whole fight had been very unusual for Zane. He knew this was the duel to the death or whatever. But Mike looked three feet tall to him; other than the man's face, he looked like a little boy throwing a temper tantrum. Zane scratched his head. He was having a lot of trouble taking the guy seriously.\par
He watched as Mike waddled over, still squealing his battle cry.\par
It reminded Zane of that one movie with the Spartans where they made their big last stand against huge odds. Except rather than fighting off a whole Persian army on their lonesome, Mike started pounding on Zane's kneecap.\par
It was pretty fascinating to watch actually. Just like with those Spartans, his passion let him draw powers far beyond what should be possible. In that moment, Mike Masters had a strength no little boy body should have.The author's narrative has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.\par
Which meant when he punched Zane's kneecap, it actually hurt. Zane wasn't crippled by it or anything, but it was probably about an equivalent amount of pain to stubbing a toe or something. Which, again, was really quite impressive considering he was doing it with his little toddler fists.\par
Well. What to do? He didn’t mind putting an end to Mike. But something about being so fun-sized—it felt kind of weird. Like beating up a kid or something—how was he even supposed to start?\par
Then Zane’s face changed. “HRNGG!”\par
Because Mike gave up pounding on Zane's kneecap. He seemed to realize he wasn't going to make much progress anytime soon. Instead, he attacked between Zane's legs with a fiery ferocity.\par
Zane found out his Steel Body apparently did not extend to his soul.\par
Mike saw him buckle; fierce hope bloomed in his face. He leaped in, pressing his advantage—\par
Okay. Fuck this.\par
Zane grabbed him by the throat. For a moment Mike seemed quite surprised he got picked up so easily. He thrashed there, wheezing, bucking—\par
And Zane elbowed him in the face. With an arm thicker than his whole head. And again, for good measure.\par
And Mike’s nose exploded. In at least three places. So did his cheekbone. And his jaw. He squealed; a fine cloud of blood spurted out his face. Then Zane tossed him up; Mike went screaming, flailing head-over-heels—as Zane wound a leg all the way back.\par
He gave the guy a hard punt. Right in the belly.\par
Helt lots of soft squishy things burst. Mike goggled; his eyes bulged; his mouth hung open, choking, hacking spittle—and then he went shrieking, flying in a beautiful wide arc. At least five bloody little teeth flew out his mouth.\par
He flopped to a halt a dozen feet away.\par
Zane marched after him. Somehow, he managed to prop himself up to his elbows—“My brothers,” he croaked, blood dribbling out his nose, his mouth, the five or so cuts on his face—he really was in a sorry state. But he clung onto hope. “Give me strength!—”\par
Zane punted him in the head again. He shrieked. Then in the body, and a geyser of blood spouted out of him. Zane kept kicking him. The more he kicked, the less hopeful the guy felt. It was interesting.\par
Soon Mike was just a bloody, pulped-up mess. He stopped moving. Which just went to show you. Turns out, sometimes it really was just the size of the dog, actually.\par
Zane panted.\par
…Okay. He couldn’t lie. That felt pretty damned satisfying.\par
Good riddance. Sneaky little shit.\par
All around him the world started sharpening again, gaining focus. He felt a sharp tug—then the world blurred once more. He was yanked hard, like his soul was snapped back on a bungee cord. Snapped back into his body; he gasped, stumbled—\par
And his sensations flooded him again. The acrid tang of smoke; the feeling of a cold night wind on his skin; but most of all, all that damned pain. Flaring up his back, down his arms—just everywhere. But now it mingled with the throbbing pain in his soul.\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 103 -> 104\par
Well. That… that was certainly an experience.\par
For a little while he just sat there, recovering. From everything. \par
Soon he was well enough to start walking back. He was annoyed to find the Marquis' Bags of Holding had burned up. At least Mike's hadn't—and a quick peek inside told him it was stuffed to the brim with high-grade essence stones; fifty or sixty, at the very least. That, at least, pleased him. Quite a hefty haul.\par
***\par
He was passing through Silicon Coven territory all the way back to VGI. Which meant a lot of quaint little mystic forests with fuzzy blue-leaved trees, silver wizard towers, and random totem poles cropping up here and there. Very wood-and-grass feel to the place.\par
He made it three Safe Zones in before he got stopped. A white-bearded, short old man in Twinkling Coven robes scrambled out to catch him—\par
Harry Walsh\par
Essence Level 66\par
Class: Wind Archmage\par
Faction: Silicon Coven\par
"Is it true?" He said eagerly. "Master Sage! Did you defeat Mike Masters?"\par
"Uh. Yeah," said Zane. "… How did you—"\par
"Incredible! I wish I could've seen the battle. I'm sure it was a spectacular affair!"\par
"Thanks."\par
For a moment the old man just goggled at him. Looking him up and down, wide-eyed.\par
"What are you doing?"\par
"Ah! Pardon. Simply—simply taking you in, good sir! I hope you don't mind—it's my first time meeting a top World Ranker… Yes! You do have that air about you. One can tell just by looking—this is not a man to be messed with!"\par
Since when was Zane a top World Ranker?\par
"Right…Uh. I'm going to go now."\par
He heard the guy's bubbly voice ring out behind him—"It was an honor meeting you, Master Sage! A true honor!"\par
***\par
It was the same way the rest of the way back. He wondered how news traveled so fast. He caught folk cheering or pumping their fists as he passed. In some Safe Zones folk in coven clothes young and old, men and women, lined the dirt streets, waving and grinning, some staring and blushing. But none of them dared get too close—it was like there was a force field around him.\par
They weren't like this just a few hours ago when he was making his way here. Was it really that big a deal?\par
***\par
He got back to Silicon Coven headquarters late at night; most folk had gone to sleep by then. But when he got to the south gate, the guards there greeted him with a big cheer—"Savage Sage! Savage Sage! Savage Sage!" They chanted over and over.\par
Elias came out to greet him. He looked quite pale.\par
"Zane motherfucking Walker!" He shouted, grinning wide. For once it seemed genuine. “You beautiful bastard! That's a huge weight off my shoulders—my God!"\par
He chuckled. “Can’t lie, I got a little nervous there. But I always knew you'd pull through, bud."\par
Sage Mind told Zane that last bit was definitely a lie.\par
Elias winked. "If they weren't paying attention to you before… put it this way. An hour ago Yuki Urabe—that's World Rank \#6, by the way—told me he wants to meet you as a representative of his Faction, which, by the way, is the second-strongest in all of Asia! And that dude doesn't give anyone the time of day.”\par
"Huh."\par
"You still don't get it. You know who's the best in the world? The ones a cut above the rest—the ones they call world powers?" Elias held up his hands; he started counting them down. "The Top 7! In terms of talent, all perfect ten-out-of-tens. Irina Volkova. D'Angelo Hall. Emeka Eze. Jason Walker. Jian Shi Ming. Yui Urabe. Cristina Dos Santos… and now—I'll bet all my stones on it—they'll be putting you in there too."\par
He chuckled. "Your girlfriend has a message waiting for you, by the way. She's wondering why every single global superpower just hit her up in the past two hours.” \par
"Oh." Reina had so much work already… Then he remembered the Tomb Kings had half a continent's worth of territory. He winced. Poor Reina. He seemed to have a strong effect on her stress; he wondered if there was a way he could spend more time with her. Could he could find some way to go back at night? Hmm.\par
"By the way," said Elias. And he tossed Zane a silky-white Bag of Holding. "There's your payment! Exactly as we agreed. Three A-rank treasures."\par


\section{117. Tomb Kings (IV)}
\par
Zane checked out the treasures inside.\par
The first was a single feather—red at the center, radiating out to yellow at the edges. It flickered and smoldered just sitting there. Fire Laws poured out of it like heat waves.\par
Feather of Astoria, Fallen Phoenix (A)\par
Fallen Phoenixes are the closest cousins to True Phoenixes. Godbeast blood runs in their veins. Like True Phoenixes, they are born knowing the Elemental Law of Fire. Their feathers are among the most potent sources of it in the universe. Handle with extreme care: this treasure is prone to eruptions. This feather was collected from Astoria, spirit pet of a Vin Elin, Inner disciple of the Azure Flame faction.\par
Lots of proper nouns Zane didn't know there, but he got the gist. He was happy with this one. This would do.\par
The next was a handful of seeds floating around each other; arcs of lightning buzzed between them like they were tiny tesla coils. They were filled to the brim with Electricity Law.\par
Lightning Lotus Seed (A)\par
Lightning Lotuses bloom in the Peak Gardens of Mount Thundercrest, during the Everstorm—a once-in-a-millennium celestial event in which tribulation lightning strikes for ninety-nine days straight. At the end of it, each Lotus Seed is deeply saturated with pure Electricity Law. When consumed they grant massive boons in essence and Electricity Law.\par
That seemed good too.\par
Then there was the Wood Law treasure for Reina.\par
Ten Ring Gourd (A)\par
Crafted from the wood of a thousand-year-old gourd vine, each of its rings marks a century of growth, knowledge, and power, offering a profound connection to Laws of Elemental Wood. This Gourd was cultivated by the Sage of the Silver Heart, Elder Monk of the Temple of the World Tree.\par
He pocketed them, nodding. Always the same few Factions. He swore he'd seen these names three or four times already—and each seemed based on an Element. \par
It would probably be a few days yet before he could really make use of the treasures. He still hadn't recovered from his last breakthrough. But he was sure he could find things to do to fill the time. For one, he had a few spars to get through. With Avery and also that Eze guy. He knew he was at least a cut above folk like Mike Masters; he had to be among the best in the world. But where did he rank in there?\par
Really he was just eager to have a really great fight. He'd been eyeing the same six or seven names at the very top since months ago… now he was finally here.\par
There was also that Hell Array to try out. He'd give it a real go this time; he liked how you could actually go all out. When Zane fought, he was never much worried about death. But he still had to care about it. There he could disregard it entirely. He could go fully ballistic if he wanted. He smiled. \par
Yes. There was lots to do. This place had been set up to be some kind of theme park for World Rankers; he'd make good use of it. \par
Speaking of—\par
"Is there some way I can speed up my soul recovery?" He asked Elias.\par
“Sure there is! Every Dojo’s got a soul sauna. Soak in there for a few days and you'll be fixed right up.” \par
Zane nodded. "One more thing. I want to go back to Reina. Every night, if I can. How can I do this?"\par
"Ahh—for that you'll want a regional teleportation portal. Pretty easy to set up between high-ranked Beacons. For you, buddy, I'll do it at cost! That'll be twenty-five high-grade essence stones."\par
Zane stared at him.\par
"… Alright," said Elias, coughing. "So maybe that's a slight exaggeration. It's really only twenty."\par
Zane kept staring at him.\par
"Fine, fine! You caught me. Fifteen."\par
Eventually they settled on four. Elias was a little miffed by the end of it, which was a good way to confirm it was the actual price. \par
“You must make dozens of high-grade essence stones a day,” said Zane. \par
“Well—hundreds,” Elias corrected. “But do go on.” \par
“And you’re fighting this hard over a portal.” \par
“It’s not about the money,” said Elias, grinning a ‘who, me?’ grin. “It’s the thrill of the chase! Oh, don’t you give me that judge-y look. Like you never hit things just to hit things.” \par
“…” \par
It would take a day to set up. Elias said the concierge would let him know when it was done. The warlock gave a wink and vanished. \par
***\par
The next morning, Zane met Avery and Evan upstairs for breakfast. The restaurants in their skyscraper spire of a hotel were for World Rankers only. Which meant they were a lot less crowded than the food courts and barbecues and food stalls and public restaurants scattered across the campus.\par
This restaurant was a fancy one. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows showed the rolling green hills of the bay; a wall of fog crept over the Golden Gate. The tables were covered in a creamy tablecloth, with so many little forks and knives Zane wondered if it was meant for a family of mice. They mostly served fruits and cheeses. In colors that never came on earth—pink cheese that melted in your mouth and blue grapes that tasted fresh as glacier water, but sweeter.A case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.\par
Avery greeted him with a wave. "Heyyo!"\par
Evan, meanwhile, gave him a big hug.\par
"You did it!" He beamed. He was all excited. "You saved northern and southern California once and for all!"\par
They all sat down and started eating. Evan clearly didn't know how to use the forks and knives, judging by how clumsily he handled them. But he did his best. Avery frowned at all the utensils, then used her longest, thinnest knife like a skewer and started going at the cheeses like she was spearfishing. Zane tried what Evan was doing for all of five seconds, gave up, grabbed a handful of cheese in one hand, and a handful of grape in the other, and just started stuffing them in his mouth.\par
Evan wanted to know every little thing about how the fight went down, so Zane told him; Evan gasped and ooh'd the whole time. Avery, meanwhile, fell off her chair laughing when he said how he ended up hitting Mike. He frowned at her. "What?"\par
"Sorry," gasped Avery. "It's just…you better never ever change, ya big lunk."\par
Eventually, they wound back to what Avery and Evan had been up to.\par
"I've been teaching him new stuff," said Avery. She grinned. "Here—watch this!"\par
She turned to Evan, who was still nibbling on a cheese wheel. "What do you do if someone gives you a piece of candy and tries to lure you into their van?"\par
Evan swallowed a bit of cheese. "I don't go in the van!" He said proudly.\par
"Correct! Why?"\par
"'Cause just because they're nice to me doesn't mean they're good people!” \par
"Exactly."\par
As a reward Avery gave him a piece of candy, which Evan accepted quite happily.\par
"I'm learning," Evan informed Zane.\par
"…What?"\par
"He got scammed out of a bunch of essence stones yesterday," said Avery cheerfully. "So I beat up the shopkeeper and got them back for him. Now I'm making him scam-proof and bribe-proof!"\par
Evan nodded, all excited. Then he blinked at Avery. "Wait…you said you asked for them back nicely."\par
“…Huh. I did say that, didn't I?" said Avery.\par
"Yup."\par
"Well, uh. Drat. It seems you've caught me in a lie. Anyway, back to the point at hand—Evan's bribe-proof now!"\par
Evan blinked. He seemed to be a little confused trying to figure out just what part of all that to focus on. He ended up latching onto the positive bit—he beamed. "I'm bribe-proof now!"\par
"Huh," said Zane.\par
Evan sat there basking happily for about three seconds. Then he blinked. "Um. Avery? I have a question."\par
"Shoot."\par
"How can you tell if they're really trying to trick you? What if they're just being nice?"\par
"That's a great question, young grasshopper," said Avery, nodding wisely. “You have to look at the person. Some people are just not nice people. So when they act nice, it's weird."\par
"Oh!" He chewed on that thought for a bit. And also on the cheese. Then—"…But how can you tell if they're nice people or not?"\par
Avery frowned. "Don't you ever look at someone and just get—y'know—bad vibes from them? A bad feeling?"\par
"…No?" said Evan, looking baffled.\par
"Hmm." Avery inspected him closely. "Hmmmm. Say. What do you think of Elias?"\par
"He seems like a really nice guy!" Evan beamed. Then he wilted a little at the look on Avery's face—"…I got it wrong again, didn't I?"\par
"Oh boy," sighed Avery. She put her hands on her hips. "We've got a lot of work to do."\par
"I think I'm just really gullible," Evan told Zane. He seemed rather sad about it.\par
"Not to worry, grasshopper!" said Avery. She gave him an encouraging pat. "By the time I'm through with you, you'll be a regular sleuth. It's like in those manga you like to read, right? So what if you're a bit of a silly goose right now? That just means you need your character arc."\par
Evan gasped. Then his eyes started shining. All his sadness washed away; suddenly he was all excited again. "I'm getting a character arc!"\par
"That's right! And fear not! I’ll be your wise old mentor. This will be awesome." \par
At this point Zane had long since lost the thread of what was going on.\par
***\par
After breakfast the two of them went off to the Light Law area again. Evan had just gotten his last Major Law, apparently. He was close to breaking through.\par
Zane, meanwhile, had planned to spend the rest of his morning recovering at that sauna Elias was talking about. Or sparring Eze if he saw the guy. Whichever came first.\par
He was just on his way to the Warrior Dojo when an explosion caught his eye.\par
An explosion rippling with the same Laws he'd seen on the Feather of Astoria. Laws of Elemental Fire. He stilled.\par
It came from a branching path; he went down it, and found a massive crowd—several hundreds strong—clamoring around what looked to be an arena-sized boxing ring. Pale blue wards bound it tight. When he inspected it a notification popped up.\par
Training Treasure: King of the Ring (A)\par
A winners-stays-on sparring challenge! The first fighter to reach Critical Health loses and is kicked out. The Ring absorbs all damage past critical, ensuring fighters can go all-out without risking their lives or their opponents'.\par
Current champion: Cain Hastings, World Rank \#8\par
Inside, a battle was going down. Or rather, winding up.\par
A spear thrust out—and Fire Law torched the scene. It fell in a dazzling inferno, sweeping waves of flame cascading one after another after another—one after another as Cain stabbed out, an endless, building eruption.\par
There was a cry, then a flash of bright-blue essence.\par
Challenger: Nicoli Moore, World Rank \#85, has been defeated!\par
"Good fight, lad! Well done!” laughed the spear-wielder. He was a chunky squat guy with a curling mustache. He looked vaguely familiar—had they met?\par
The challenger gave a little pained nod and ducked out of the ring. The crowd poured on raucous applause. Cain soaked in it, smiling, bowing.\par
"Thank you!” he said. He had a pleasant, booming voice. "Thank you, everyone! It's my pleasure. I must say. Just a day ago, I had a rather shocking and unpleasant experience that almost sent me packing my bags and sailing back to England. Well—I'm glad I stayed! I've shown a higher class today, my friends, than I thought I was capable of!"\par
The crowd seemed to agree. They started chanting—"Has-tings! Has-tings!"\par
"The Lion of Manchester!"\par
"The uncrowned king!"\par
Cain was loving it; he took a little victory lap.\par
"Who's next!" He roared. He even beat his chest. "Who's next? It'll take a brave man, I'll say! Why, in the form I'm in now—I daresay I could beat any man in the world!"\par
Zane was just about to volunteer. He was grinning just watching; those were fighting words.\par
It turned out someone felt exactly the same way. Because those words had hardly left Cain's mouth when a stark feeling shot up on the other side of the crowd—a feeling so strong it cut through the swathe of feeling-noise, shone singular and bright over it all.\par
It was a feeling of burning pride, a feeling of intense competitiveness.\par
"Is that so?" said a deep, measured voice. \par
An aura flared. A vast, unfathomably heavy aura; standing in its presence felt like staring down a ravine with no bottom. It towered over even Cain's.\par
And it silenced the crowd in an instant.\par
A man strode in from the edge of the crowd. A man built thick and dense; his muscles were starkly defined, his features strong and regal. He looked like a Terminator.\par
Emeka Eze\par
Essence Level 114\par
Signature Title: Touch of Death\par
The crowd parted, choking and gasping and shoving over themselves, like peasants before a king. He didn't acknowledge them. He only had eyes for the man in the ring. A man who'd suddenly gone quite pale.\par
Emeka leapt—and landed right in the center of the ring.\par
Then he leveled his eyes at Cain. And spoke.\par
"I'm next."\par


\section{118. The Touch of Death (I) }
\par
(1/1)\par
There was a deathly silence. Then— “Emeka Eze!” said Cain. His voice came out shaky and about an octave higher than before. He cleared his throat, tried getting his voice under control. "What…What a lovely surprise!"\par
He was smiling, but he was actually quite spooked. You could even see it on his face—his smile was brittle; the color had drained from his face. All his confidence had been doused with cold water.\par
Eze nodded. He met Cain's eyes with a gaze so intense the man visibly shrank a little.\par
"You said you could beat any man in the world. Did you mean that?" He sounded strangely hopeful. Zane even felt a little excitement simmering in him.\par
Cain gulped. Zane felt a sinking, churning feeling from the guy—a feeling like nausea. Still—"Why—yes!" Cain blustered. "Of course I do! A man's got to believe in himself, eh?" He chuckled. No one else did.\par
Eze kept staring at him. But this time Cain managed to stay firm, keep his head high. He wasn't really fooling anyone, even himself. But he didn't back down, and for that Zane gave him some credit.\par
"A man should believe in himself," said Eze. "Precisely as much as he deserves." He paused. Then a trace of a smile came over his lips. "I hope you’re correct in your assessment."\par
He held out a hand. "Shall we begin?"\par
"Eh? Ah—yes!" They shook. And Cain gave a brave if wobbly smile. "Best of luck!"\par
"Luck," said Eze. He was faintly amused. You couldn't really see it on his face, but Zane could feel it. "I don't believe in that."\par
***\par
Bout scheduled!\par
World Rank \#3, Emeka Eze VS World Rank \#9, Cain Hastings\par
Zane knew basically nothing about Cain Hastings. He knew Eze was meant to have this unstoppable death-touch or something? Avery made it sound pretty bad. He supposed he'd get a chance to see it.\par
In just the few minutes since the bout was agreed, word had somehow gotten out. The crowd was ballooning. Thousands of people were pouring into the little square; a lot of them noticed him too. Lots of gasps and stares—a few shouted his name. He ignored them. He was focused on the stage.\par
Cain's heart rate was skyrocketing. He was prowling around the ring like a caged animal; he couldn't seem to stand still. He was mumbling something to himself, over and over—a chant maybe? He was trying to hype himself up. His mustache quivered with nervousness.\par
He knew—just as well as anyone else—no one expected him to win. He was trying desperately to make himself believe. And Zane thought that was right, actually. This was going to go down—What else was he supposed to do? You had to give yourself your best shot, no matter what.\par
And it seemed to be working. When Cain looked up again, his nostrils flared. He turned up his lip. He had a new fragile confidence.\par
Eze, meanwhile, was perfectly calm. He just stood there waiting.\par
3...\par
2…\par
1…\par
Pale translucent wards flared up around the ring, blocking off the crowd. Trapping the fighters inside.\par
Begin!\par
Cain held out a hand and a spear dropped through. A hefty thing, taller than he was, a silver shaft leading up to a gleaming fist-sized tip.\par
Eze summoned his soul weapons too. Two gauntlets that looked like they were made for giants—too big for human fists; each was the size of his torso. They ended at his elbows, monstrosities of interlocking plate.\par
It was Cain who rushed out first. He gave a valiant roar and sprang out—his spear swept out; its tip flared red. And flames erupted in a brilliant burst; it all came crashing down on Eze. Fire Law in its finest, purest form. Not as fast as Stormfire, nor as bright—but it burned with a fury even Zane couldn't match. It felt like it could rage through anything.\par
But Eze watched it coming; he waited patiently. Then, when the time was right, he threw up his massive gauntlets. He sealed himself off. Elemental Earth flared down the plates—and there was that fathomless feeling again like Zane was staring down a bottomless fissure.\par
The Fire poured in; there was an eruption of it, an explosion, a blast of furious feeling—then it broke, petered out, screaming into the void. The gauntlets held firm.\par
Then Cain leaped back, tensing like he was expecting a counter.\par
But none came.\par
Eze just watched him with those bright intense eyes.\par
Cain gritted his teeth. Zane could guess what he was thinking; something like—Alright, fine! Try this on for size!\par
He leaped in again, roaring a battle-cry, launched another thrust. And again Eze just blocked. But this time Cain followed with a looping slash; Eze stepped calmly aside, let a fuming red-yellow line splatter into the wards.\par
Still he stood there and watched. Still waiting. The crowd started to murmur. Cain was also getting a little confused—what was the guy doing? Why wasn't he attacking?Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.\par
In the end, he decided it didn't matter. If Eze wasn't doing anything—fine. He'd press his advantage! He went at it again; this time he unleashed a flurry—stab-stab-stab, each brighter and fiercer than the last. And each time Eze just block-block-blocked. There was a deep reverberating THUDDING as Fire met Earth. It tried to explode, to catch, to scorch; it wanted so badly to tear through. But Cain could find no gaps in Eze's defense.\par
And still Eze refused to strike.\par
Something odd, though—the first time Eze blocked, he'd thrown up something like a blanket shield. The second time, his block shot up just as the spear was falling. The third and the fourth were perfect parries. The timing was just right. Not a drop of essence wasted.\par
It was almost like he had Sage Mind too. But that wasn't quite it. He didn't feel things coming; he didn't know Cain's soul like Zane did. He just…saw them coming. And with every strike, the picture only grew clearer.\par
In his own way, he was slowly comprehending his enemy. But Zane did it by feeling. For Eze there was something mechanical about it, something coldly logical…\par
No one else seemed aware of it, not even Cain. Cain was actually slowly gaining confidence, gaining momentum. His determination was rising; he was starting to get into a flow. All this time he hadn't stopped attacking. One eruption gave way to the next, gave way to the next, each raging over the last, growing hotter, brighter, fiercer; soon each blast shook the whole arena, plastered bright walls of heat against the ward walls.\par
Eze narrowed his eyes. He kept blocking and blocking—but Cain wouldn't stop climbing. He was reaching a crescendo; he roared valiantly, thrust out a scorcher of a spear—\par
And this time, it felt so powerful it felt like one of Zane's meteors.\par
It struck Eze's guard. And even with perfect timing, seamless defense—the man was shoved a step back.\par
Gasps ran through the crowd—he'd broken through!\par
And Cain wasn't done.\par
He stabbed again, fiercer yet, and the sheer force of the blow buckled Eze's knees, made him stumble back another step. And now, everyone was genuinely in shock. Cain pressed forward, seizing his advantage.\par
And everyone was holding their breaths. A few started to cheer. It was just dawning on them what they were witnessing. Eze had screwed around a little too long. He'd taken his enemy a little too lightly—he should never have let Cain build up like this! But by now it was too late.\par
Two more dominating thrusts and Eze had his back against the wards. There was almost nowhere left to go. A fierce hope bloomed in Cain's heart. He let out a joyful roar. His aura swelled like a rising tide; a truly monstrous amount of essence—the crowd got swept up in it. A breathless awe gripped them all. They knew they were witnessing something special. They knew they were witnessing the fall of a titan!\par
Well—everyone except Zane.\par
Zane was still frowning. Because though Eze was forced back, though his shields were starting to crack against that brutal heat, his mind was exactly like it'd been at the start.\par
Ice cold.\par
He hadn't changed a single thing. He was still watching. Still waiting. For what?\par
Then something struck him. A joy.\par
An epiphany.\par
As everyone else looked to the falling inferno of a spear, Zane watched Eze's eyes.\par
He watched them change color.\par
One moment his pupils were black—the next a vibrant purple. And whatever he'd been comprehending was complete.\par
Zane felt a ripple in the air. Something very, very odd—like a gravitational ripple in the astral plane.\par
Emeka Eze smiled.\par
By now Cain's aura had been building so long it was getting out of hand; there was essence in each strike it was approaching Zane's Wish Upon a Star. Cain pressed forth, mustache quivering fiercely; the poor guy couldn't believe it—he was doing it—he was winning! As it dawned on him he started getting emotional. In that moment of triumph, he felt a intense joy, a fierce pride, a feeling of blissful redemption—\par
For the first time that fight, Eze struck back.\par
He threw a punch. It wasn't a very impressive punch. There was no way in hell that was the most essence he could draw out; it was a mediocre strike for even your average World Ranker. There wasn't much Law on it at all. And it was rising against a tumbling avalanche of exploding essence.\par
It should be crushed in an instant.\par
Yet…\par
Zane frowned. There was something about the intent behind the blow.\par
That was an ordinary punch. But where it went was not ordinary at all. It went exactly where Eze wanted it to go. And the way Eze felt right now—he had an unnatural confidence—the kind of confidence one has in history. Like the fight was in the past; like he'd already won; like he'd seen it happen. And what followed was just replay.\par
He was so confident something about it infected Zane. Zane wasn't even shocked by what happened next.\par
The spear met the fist. BANG!\par
And the fist broke through.\par
There was an explosion alright—but not in the direction anyone expected. Cain gave a shocked cry; he went stumbling back, swerving with the force of it, as all his flames bowed inward. Just collapsed in on themselves. As the Skill tore apart at the seams and imploded in a brilliant fireball.\par
Zane had felt it coming, and even he took a moment to understand what just happened.\par
That punch struck Cain's Skill at the exact place it was weakest—and broke it.\par
Which should have been impossible. Unless you knew two things: exactly where the enemy strike would be. And exactly how the essence in it would flow.\par
With Sage Mind Zane could know the first. But even he'd be clueless about the second.\par
Something else that was interesting. He just realized—Eze's gauntlet stopped exactly at the point of contact. There was no essence backlash. No essence leaking out into the world.\par
The reason he'd thrown that much essence was simple. It was exactly how much he needed to break Cain's strike.\par
The crowd was still catching up. They had no clue what they were seeing. So was Cain; he was shocked but he still spun around, salvaged most of his momentum, chucked it into another shot—\par
And Eze stepped forward, cool as can be. He wasn't moving particularly quickly. He wasn't throwing particularly hard. His next punch came out almost casually. BANG!\par
Cain cried out and went spinning back again. And the crowd stared in dumb shock. Cain tried again, throwing the full heft of his essence into this one—BANG! And he flew halfway down the ring.\par
And Eze closed in on him.\par
Cain was still off-balance; he didn't understand what was going on—he was doing so well! He started to panic, and bad; he flailed out a thrust—BANG! By then Cain was falling over himself; he tried blocking with the spear-tip—BANG!—then, desperately, with the shaft—BANG!\par
And his spear went flying out of his hands. He spun all the way around, wailing out—"NO!"\par
It was then that Zane remembered.\par
Eze threw one last punch.\par
It felt like the whole world holds it breath; everything stilled. The only thing that existed, the only thing that moved, was the fist. Not hurrying, not lagging. An ordinary, everyday thing. It moved through the air like death, or like fate—arriving, inevitably. Cain tried getting out of the way.\par
But somehow every single person watching knew there was no getting out of the way.\par
Even Cain.\par
Zane tapped into his feelings then, and felt an infinite blackness yawning before him. And it swallowed him. Cain was made to feel very, very small. A speck caught in the pitiless grasp of some cosmic force he could never comprehend. There was nothing he could do; nothing at all.\par
Cain opened his mouth to scream.\par
Eze's fist grazed his chin, soft as a kiss.\par
BANG.\par
\par
***\par
\par
Horror and awe reigned. The crowd was frozen in shock. All except for one man—one man striding with purpose for the ring, breathing heavy, blood running hot…\par
\par
***\par
Challenger: Cain Hastings, World Rank \#9, has been defeated!\par
And then, a long silence.\par
Emeka sighed.\par
Yet another disappointment.\par
The healers carried the man off on a stretcher. Emeka shook his head, turned to go—\par
“Wait," rumbled a voice.\par
He stilled. Turned.\par
Someone else had gotten in the ring. Someone whose eyes were burning with fighting spirit.\par
“I’m next,” said Zane Walker.\par


\section{119. The Touch of Death (II)}
\par
The punch landed, and they all felt it. You didn't even need Sage Mind—the aftershock swept the far and wide, passing through every soul there. A soft echo of what Cain had felt—a futility, an utter hopelessness, on and on.\par
Silence reigned. They were all frozen. Shaken. The treasure had spared Cain's life—but if it wasn't there...\par
They all knew what would've happened.\par
But one person there was having a very different reaction.\par
Zane stood there, breathing heavy. He couldn't stop staring.\par
Emeka Eze was very strong.\par
The interesting thing wasn't that the guy could destroy you with one shot. It was that you knew it was coming; you saw it coming all along—you just couldn't stop it. It really was like death. Inevitable.\par
Zane's heart beat faster and faster.\par
Something about Eze's eyes—they saw right through you. It saw things about you even you didn't know.\par
Funny thing, though.\par
Zane had a very similar Skill. He had a different way of going about it but they got to the same place in the end…\par
The question was—what happened if those two Skills matched up? His eyes, with Zane's mind?\par
What happened if Zane fought him?\par
Zane was already striding toward the ring, striding through the still crowd.\par
You couldn't just dangle someone that strong and that interesting in front of Zane, and expect him not to fight them.\par
He almost couldn't help himself he was so excited.\par
***\par
He saw Eze turned his back, about to leave—"Wait!"\par
And he landed on the stage. "I'm next," he breathed.\par
The crowd stared in shock. Then—\par
"Oh my god!"\par
"It's the Savage Sage!"\par
"He just killed Mike Masters, didn't he?"\par
"Is he challenging Eze?!"\par
"No way…"\par
It felt like no-one dared breathe as Eze blinked, turned, then cocked his head.\par
Zane met his gaze squarely. They both stilled. For a moment they just stood there, sizing each other up.\par
"Zane Walker," said Eze. He blinked. "You've broken through." Then he pursed his lips and cast his eyes toward the healers. They were carrying Cain off on a stretcher. "But… simply being Foundation is no longer enough to stand with me. Neither is being a top World Ranker, it seems. Not anymore."\par
He sighed.\par
"I remember. I promised you a spar." Eze pursed his lips. Then shook his head. "Not today."\par
Zane blinked. "What?"\par
"It is clear to me," said Eze slowly, sadly, "I will not find what I am looking for here. For now I am no longer interested in fighting."\par
Eze turned to go—Zane didn't understand.\par
Then he felt it.\par
Eze was full of disappointment right now. At Cain— he thought Cain would do better.\par
After Eze crushed the guy so badly—without taking a single hit, really—he just didn't think anyone here could pose a challenge to him; not anymore. He felt he'd gotten himself all hyped up for nothing. His fighting spirit was gone. There was a loneliness to it.\par
He thought fighting Zane would be a waste of time too.\par
Zane scratched his head. The thing was, Zane was all hyped up now. He felt antsy and itchy now—what was he supposed to do?\par
He watched Eze go, helpless.\par
How had Cain gotten Eze to fight in the first place?\par
Then Zane remembered—he'd roused the guy's fighting spirit. Hmm. Could he try a little trash talk, maybe? It was crude, but—"I think I can beat you," Zane called.\par
Eze went very still.\par
He frowned. He turned, eyes narrowed. And it was like an ember flaring in a dying hearth.\par
"Do you."\par
Honestly, Zane hadn't thought that would work. He wasn't even sure it counted as trash talk. So when Eze turned he was caught a little off-guard.\par
He figured he should probably follow it up with something. But he was having serious trouble coming up stuff; he just wasn't a trash-talky kind of person. He ended up saying—"Uh. Yes."\par
Somehow that worked too. Eze frowned. Zane had his attention.\par
"That is not an empty boast," said Eze. He sounded surprised. "You truly believe that."\par
"…Yes."\par
Eze considered him. His frown deepened; a thought seemed to occur to him. A thought that gave him pause. "You saw my battle with Cain. You saw the Touch of Death."\par
"I did."\par
"And you… are not afraid of me." Suddenly he was very interested in Zane.\par
Zane was going to say 'No,' but he paused. Right now Eze was only interested—Zane had to get him a little more hyped up, he sensed. How could he… what might Avery say?\par
He shrugged. "What's there to be afraid of?"Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.\par
"…" Eze twitched. And in him flared a fierce, furious pride.\par
Yes! \par
"Very well," said Eze softly. And he walked back in the ring, eyes shining. "Zane Walker, I accept your challenge."\par
***\par
A stunned silence. A heartbeat.\par
And the crowd exploded.\par
***\par
Gasps, shouts, hundreds of voices screaming over each other—\par
"Did—did the Savage Sage just?!—" \par
"Didn't he see how badly Cain just got destroyed? He doesn't stand a chance!"\par
"Yes he does! Didn't you hear how he crushed Masters?!"\par
"Those two are on another level!"\par
Right near the ring, a World Ranker girl was clutching a crystal to her ear, screaming into it—"You won't believe what's happening—I don't care! Screw your Water Law comprehension! I swear to God, Cass—you better come right now! ZANE WALKER'S FIGHTING EMEKA EZE!"\par
***\par
Bout scheduled! \par
World Rank \#10, Zane Walker VS World Rank \#3, Emeka Eze\par
In just a few minutes it would start.\par
Between bouts Eze walked over to the edge of the ring—he was talking to Coven officials and pointy silver hats. He heard Eze seemed to be asking to get the mat adjusted. It wasn't lined up right with the ring's corners, Eze said. He was very insistent they get it fixed.\par
Zane wasn't sure what he was doing but it didn't seem anything sneaky; it just bothered the guy a strange amount. In the meantime, Zane turned up Sage Mind.\par
Emeka Eze\par
Essence Level 114\par
Signature Title: Touch of Death\par
Class: Earthbound Titan\par
Key Laws:\par
Elemental Law of Earth\par
Major Law of Shadow Weaving (Elemental Law of Darkness)\par
Major Law of Night's Dominion (Elemental Law of Darkness)\par
Major Law of Void Embrace (Elemental Law of Darkness)\par
Key Skills:\par
Touch of Death (Active) [Signature]\par
A shot that has a 10\% chance of taking the opponent's health to zero—regardless of how much Health they have. The more vulnerable the target, the cleaner the strike, the higher this percentage gets. Touch of Death strikes the body and soul. This Skill cannot be leveled.\par
Eye of Fate (Active) [Signature] The wielder's eyes can trace the path of the future by following the lines of Fate. In the right hands, this is one of the most potent offensive Skills in the Universe.\par
Stonewall Shield (Active) [Legendary]\par
A powerful and resolute defensive Skill that exemplifies the resilience of stone. Excels in crushing concussive force and stifling Elemental explosions. \par
Seismic Smash (Active) [Legendary]\par
A punch which sets off an earthquake in the enemy's body, dealing massive vibrational and concussive damage. \par
So those eyes of his went way deeper than Zane thought—they didn't just analyze the enemy. He was literally seeing the future. Huh.\par
Now Zane was even more interested to see how it matched up with Sage Mind. Zane was biased, but he still felt he had the advantage—no matter what the description wanted to believe. Whatever Eze saw, Zane would still feel him coming.\par
Meanwhile, if the crowd had been going wild over Eze vs. Cain, it was getting unmanageable now. They were spilling out into the main street; folk were lined up at the edges trying to look on through binoculars. He saw folk crowding terraces on the nearby skyscrapers; cheering floated over from the rooftops.\par
Then he noticed that even Elias had made it ringside. He waved cheerfully. He brought an assistant—a guy pointing some weird contraption at the ring, what looked to be a giant crystal. Essence poured into it from the front and beamed out on top in thin pale lines, going who knew where.\par
"Recording crystal!" Elias shouted over the din. "Streaming worldwide!" And he gave Zane a thumbs up.\par
This was getting to be a lot bigger than he thought.\par
***\par
Soon it was starting. Eze stood across from Zane, waiting. He was mostly calm. But Zane felt a red-hot feeling burning deep in his heart. It had been there ever since Zane challenged him.\par
He was a little surprised his trash talk worked—it was pretty bland, if he was honest. Was it even trash talk? But he supposed Eze was just that competitive.\par
3…\par
2…\par
1…\par
Begin.\par
Zane turned up Sage Mind. At the same time, Eze's eyes brightened—\par
He focused on Eze's soul. And Eze was watching him—watching him with those shining Eyes—\par
Zane felt himself. Or rather—he felt what Eze was seeing, and it was like Sage Mind passed through too—into that future-sight. Huh. He felt himself as a cloud of thoughts and feelings and intentions.\par
Future-him was frowning. Scratching his head.\par
Then he felt two Zanes. One was standing there frowning. One took a step back. …What? \par
Two ghostly hims. Floating in the air. Or rather—two ghostly futures…? They fell to just one as future became present—even as more popped up. Ghostly clouds of sensation, two, then three, then four. Rising and falling…\par
The more he focused on one particular future, the longer it played out, like a movie. Except it too started branching and changing—after just a few seconds it was enough to give him a headache.\par
Huh. \par
It'd been five seconds and this was already very weird.\par
But Zane and Eze were quickly coming to the same understanding, seemed like. Eze's lips were pursed; then he was nodding. He'd chosen a path. The moment he did that ghost started brightening; the rest dimmed quick.\par
Then he advanced, gauntlets clenched, brimming with confidence. He had a very simple plan in mind. To crush Zane so quickly, so utterly, it wouldn't only crush any doubt in the crowd's mind that he was the best.\par
It would crush any doubt in Zane's mind too.\par
…The guy was maybe a little too proud.\par
And Zane felt the line of Fate. Eze would advance. He'd throw a Seismic Smash. Zane would leap away, counter with a meteor—Eze would block. Turn. And Smash Zane in the face.\par
That was a future three moves deep and it was already hurting Zane's head. Just an army of ghosts dancing in his skull…\par
It was coming up fast, too—in seconds it'd be the real future!\par
But if he knew this was the path Eze was going down…\par
He forced himself to go further. He wasn't even thinking; it was more like he was a blind man in a forest, feeling his way down the paths… to the moment of the block, and the turn—down that burgeoning ghostly field of possibility. He'd choose the one he wanted…. There! \par
By then it was upon him.\par
Eze dashed for him. A fist as big as a boulder smashed over his head; he was forced to leap away—he lashed out with a meteor but Eze was wise to it. He'd seen it. He threw up a Stonewall Shield, and dense Earth Laws smothered the Stormfire blast—BOOM! \par
Then he turned with the momentum. Let it whip him all the way around—and Eze’s boulder-sized gauntlet was lined up right with Zane's face, hurtling toward him. A fist that had a sense of utter finality to it; an ordinary fist, yet just seeing it gave you a sense of creeping dread. A fist laced with the Touch of Death. Night-night.\par
Except… Zane's face wasn't there to take the punch.\par
Because even though Eze saw all this coming—Zane did too.\par
Zane just saw one move deeper.\par
So he put face a foot to the left. Eze frowned. And Zane grinned.\par
Gotcha.\par
Then Zane's Stormfire Punch crunched into his nose.\par
There was a beautiful explosion.\par
He went flying, face smoldering—he righted himself mid-air, dropped to the ground. He must've had something like Zane's Steel Body because his face wasn't ruined—just scalded. He touched a hand to his nose, blinking in shock.\par
Bloody.\par
He wasn’t the only one stunned silent. The crowd was too.\par
Then they went wild. People were holding their heads in their hands; jaw dropped, eyes popped. They couldn’t seem to believe what was happening. Like they just saw a god bleed.\par
And the man who dealt the blow stood right in front of them.\par
Zane drowned it all out; he only had eyes for Eze. He wasn't sure what he expected. Maybe a furious roar? Or a gnashing of teeth? But Eze stared dumbly at his hand… and then he started to smile. He started chuckling.\par
"That was wonderful," he murmured. "You beat me to the punch. I... don't believe that's ever happened to me."\par
Why was he smiling like that? All he felt was joy—joy, and hope.\par
That was how Zane might react if he got punched in the face.\par
"First blood goes to you, Savage Sage," said Eze. He licked his lips. "You can see the strings of Fate, just as I see them—that's it, isn't it? When two agents try changing Fate… it splits.”\par
Not quite. Zane was really accessing those 'strings of Fate' through Eze's own mind, his own powers—and he was feeling, not seeing. But it was pretty much the same deal. Zane was a little spooked how close to bang-on that guess was.\par
"Four moves deep, yes?" mused Eze; his eyes fluttered. "I see it now. Smash. Leap. Counter. Turn… Punch. You waited for me at the end of the path I chose, and caught me there. Only… you've made one crucial mistake."\par
He was still smiling as he cocked his head. "You should’ve used your hammer. Perhaps then you could've hobbled me. As it is, you've thrown away your greatest advantage…I took you lightly before. Never again."\par
He spat out a mouthful of blood.\par
And his pride—his fighting spirit—it blazed so bright it felt blinding in the eye of Sage Mind.\par
He smiled bloodily. "Now, the real fight begins."\par


\section{120. The Touch of Death (III) }
\par
Eze's eyes began to glow. Shit.\par
Zane rushed to match him.\par
Something was coming—Zane could feel it. The two of them started circling each other like prowling lions. All around them, the crowd stood in hushed, breathless silence.\par
Zane tapped into Eze's mind and felt another world. A ghostly shifting world... what was the guy up to? Sage Mind couldn't tell Zane what Eze saw. But Zane could feel it—feel it in the way those ghostly futures fell away, and the true path started to emerge... a single future, rushing up fast—\par
Zane felt his way in. His senses exploded; he got one move deep and there were three Ezes and three Zanes at war. Two moves in and it blew up to ten—then thirty—it was all getting jumbled; he couldn't keep it all straight. He barely managed to puzzle out four moves in—then Eze burst into motion.\par
The ghosts vanished. And one turned real. By then Zane could only trust his feelings.\par
And Eze was on him in an instant—a giant blur of Law and essence; a gauntlet the size of a car rained down on him, blasting a Seismic Smash—and Zane blocked.\par
There were three ways he could have blocked. Two of them had him flattened out within three moves.\par
And one of them was correct. His Chains flew up, caught the blow, turned it away—BOOM!\par
Even deflected he felt the force of it, a visceral thing, rattling down his arms, trembling deep down—down to the core of him. It felt like the aftershocks of an earthquake—an earthquake pulsing up his gut, vibrating his organs—a very strange, unpleasant sensation. Steel body should have blocked it off—but thick earth laws warred with his own. His body became a battleground.\par
It hadn't even landed clean, and he could still feel how badly it stressed his innards. Still—he held together.\par
Then the second smash landed. BOOM!\par
Zane caught it on his Chains again; this time he went reeling. It wasn't just Touch of Death—every shot Eze threw was devastating.\par
But he saw all this coming—and he'd just weathered the worst of it.\par
Time to make him pay. He spun with the force of the blow and unleashed a Stormfire Smash. Eze threw up his gauntlets, making a shield—and took the meteor head-on. The sheer force of the blast forced him back a step. Even as he stumbled Zane was smashing a meteor over the top. There was just no time to dodge—\par
In Zane's mind Eze was about to block. The meteor would storm right through, send the guy halfway across the ring—\par
Eze clenched a fist. Wait—what? \par
Zane hadn't—\par
Eze unleashed a crushing Seismic Smash.\par
Normally Sage Mind might've picked it up. But Sage Mind was preoccupied with a hundred other sets of feelings, future and past; it took a second to catch up to the present.\par
By then it was too late.\par
Zane blocked low. But Eze wasn't punching him. His fist sailed up—past Zane. At the meteor.\par
A meteor on a Chain. A Chain that was very much attached to Zane.\par
A massive force jerked upward—and then he was flying. Careening sideways—Shit! \par
And he knew what was coming; what would be waiting for him as he spun around. Luckily, he'd seen Touch of Death before. He knew exactly how fast it was. It might be incredibly strong but it moved like an ordinary punch.\par
He'd make it in time! He brought up his Chains to block—\par
CRUNCH.\par
Pain exploded in his face. And he went flying, spinning head over heels, eyes streaming. He felt like he'd been hit in the face with a baseball bat. Something—maybe many things—broke in his face at once. He landed in a crouch, panting.\par
His head wouldn't stop vibrating; it was a vibration that went down to his bones; he felt it in his skull, in his brain. His vision was swimming.\par
That hadn't been Touch of Death. It was too fast. It shot out like a piston—it was another Seismic Smash! And Eze whacked him with it precisely because he knew Zane would be in time to block Touch of Death.\par
Because he'd seen it.\par
Eze had looked five moves deep. Exactly one more than Zane when he'd landed his own punch.\par
Zane blinked the blurriness out of his eyes, wobbled to his feet. And there was Eze. Standing across from him. Smiling. Zane knew exactly what it meant.\par
Whatever you can do? I can do better.\par
Zane spat out a mouthful of blood—then put a hand to his broken nose, crunching it, setting it back in place.\par
And he smiled right back.This story has been stolen from Royal Road. If you read it on Amazon, please report it\par
There was no doubt what his smile meant either. Oh, I see. That's how it is, huh?\par
And deep in his heart… his fighting spirit exploded.\par
They stood across from each other, two burning pillars of feeling. Of that wonderful, furious, fervent, pulse-pounding, life-giving feeling.\par
And the crowd went ballistic. Zane could tell they were going quite nuts. But he blocked them all out. All his focus went to the man standing across from him. The man staring him dead in the eyes.\par
Now they'd both drawn blood. And even though that wasn't a Touch of Death, it still knocked off a good tenth of his health. Zane wiped the blood off his mouth.\par
And they reset.\par
Prowling again, stalking around the ring, circling each other. Watching. Not each other; not quite—in just moments they'd raced far beyond the present. They were racing each other through time—like they were taking each other through a deep dark forest, and the path out was only wide enough for one.\par
Instantly, Zane could tell this stuff came more naturally to Eze. Zane only had Sage Mind; it wasn't even meant for this. Zane could only feel his way through. But Eze's mind was made for it—his Skill was made for it. It was like they were both trying to dig deeper, but where Eze had a shovel, Zane had a spoon.\par
Granted… it was a very big spoon. It would do.\par
Like with a lot of things in Zane's life, it didn't matter as much if he wasn't as skilled. His sheer size compensated for a lot.\par
One move in, two… three moves, and he felt like he was standing in a ghostly crowd. Four, and you could hardly pick them apart anymore; it became a vast cloud of churning sensations—it took some serious effort to keep it from splintering, going to meaningless noise. He was getting a little woozy. He just knew on the other side, Eze must be close by. At least four moves in too.\par
It gave Zane that little extra kick in the ass.\par
He made it five moves, and he staggered. It wasn't even a brain thing; it was a heart thing, a soul thing; so much sensation was flooding him, he was worried he'd get lost in it all. It felt like hearing a stadium all screaming at him—but he had to pick out that one right voice, that one voice brighter than the rest—\par
Then he felt a spark of joy across from him, very clear, and he knew Eze had hit on something too. He must be at five, just like Zane was.\par
So five wasn't good enough, then.\par
If you asked him a moment ago, he could have sworn five was his limit. And yet…\par
He remembered Eze's smile. Anything you can do, I can do better. \par
Zane gritted his teeth. He gave it one last shove. His soul felt like it was straining at the seams; he coughed, doubled over—felt a brilliant pain stabbing at his soul.\par
He gasped… then grinned.\par
This time it was Zane who lunged first.\par
Eze blinked, frowned—his visions fell away. Time was up: the real test came barreling at him.\par
Zane swung a meteor; Eze leaped away. And Zane followed, carrying the momentum, spinning into another blinding blast. Both meteors rained down at once—and Eze took them head-on. BOOM! BOOM! Another swing scorched the air; Eze ducked under, fists streaming, uncorked a haymaker—deeper and deeper they went. Four moves in and explosions were rocking the battlefield; it was like mountains and meteors collapsing on the ring at once; the whole place trembled, struggling to withstand it.\par
By the fifth move they were blurs of motion, momentum on momentum on momentum—a meteor rushing in from the side, Zane running down the front, fists streaming; Eze swinging easily out of the meteor's path, blocking a Stormfire punch—\par
Move six. Eze felt the heat of it before he saw it. He looked up in surprise.\par
He barely had time to throw up a flimsy shield before a second meteor—falling from above, out of sight—smashed into him. And tore right through it. And detonated.\par
Eze was quite a big man. Almost exactly as big as Zane actually. And he still went flying, tumbling over himself, streaking smoke and fire—he smashed into the wards and slid to a sorry halt, coughing and hacking. He sat there dumbfounded for a moment. His whole body was steaming, skin singed raw.\par
Then he snorted.\par
And that same old smile came on his face. He picked himself back up, brushed himself off. And they were back, stalking the ring. The race began again.\par
Zane couldn't stop grinning. Neither could Eze.\par
They didn't even need to say anything. The rest of the world faded away; it was just them, locked in exchange after exchange—locked until one of them fell.\par
Zane knew it wouldn't be him.\par
So did Eze.\par
Zane couldn't read minds, only feelings, but he could pick the thought off Eze's face—Sure. You got me. Now watch this.\par
But if he thought Zane was just gonna stand there and let him one-up him again—well. He had another thing coming!\par

Ancestral Hall — Shaolin Temple \par
Zhengzhou, China\par
The Ancestral Hall of the Shaolin Temple Safe Zone had a historic kind of beauty. Its walls were made of a rich ancient oak painted vibrant red, overflowing with intricate gold carvings. Statues of martial heroes of yore ran the length of the place.\par
They led up to an altar. And there, sitting atop it, was a bald potbellied man in red monk's robes. Empty bottles—each a B-ranked treasure—lolled around him. He burped; his breath . Then laughed. He was watching a livestream of a fight beamed halfway across the world. And grinning. He was World Rank \#5, Jian Shi Ming. The Spitfire Monk.\par
"I love it!" he boomed. He slapped his belly. "Both of them have such fire!"\par
"Who do you think will win, Master?" It was his advisor, Shen—a thin pale man.\par
"Eh?" Ming scrunched his face. He chucked a bottlecap at the man; it ping'd off Shen's shiny head. "It's always 'winning and losing' with you! Freaking nerd. Can't you just enjoy a great fight?!"\par
"Sorry…" winced Shen, rubbing at the spot.\par
Ming tongued his cheek, and frowned. "Well. Hmm. I think…hmm. Walker is winning right now. But Eze should take it in the end. Mind like a steel cage, that one." Smiling, he took another swig. "Such spirit!" He let out another booming laugh.\par

A few minutes later… \par
Tower of Empires \par
New York City\par
The Tower of Empires in what used to be New York City was nine mini-kingdoms, stacked atop each other. It was once an A-ranked dungeon with nine floors, each with a powerful Monster kingdom.\par
Now it was a Safe Zone. Because the two fighters in the throne room at very top floor had conquered them all.\par
An essence projection floated before them. There was Zane's face, blown up to triple its size. They watched in great detail as he ate another Seismic Smash to the face—and got his nose broken. For the second time that fight.\par
"Are you kidding me?" screamed Jason Walker as the essence projection. A bloody, furious aura raged out of him, surging out the tower, scaring birds into flight. "What the hell was that?! Get your fucking head in the game!"\par
Beside him, World Rank \#2 D'Angelo Hall gave a snort. "I can't tell if you're rooting for him or against him."\par

Interstellar Bastion \par
Seattle\par
Reina had been in the middle of a council meeting involving delegates from every Luminous Faction Safe Zone when she heard the news.\par
She cancelled it immediately. Then she went to the projection room and started watching.\par
She knew Zane went to San Francisco to train, and this sort of exercise was part of that. It was to be expected. It was easy to remember when he landed a shot.\par
Then she saw him take one to the face and was halfway out of the room before she knew it. She had to take a few deep breaths before she could resist the incredibly strong urge to find the nearest teleportation portal to San Francisco and drag him bodily out of the ring.\par
She made herself sit back down. His face, broken nose and all, popped back up on screen.\par
She sat there steaming.\par


\section{121. The Touch of Death (IV)}
\par
Zane could tell when they both hit a wall six moves deep.\par
Every new level just ballooned. For Zane, it felt like his soul was stretching, tearing at the seams.\par
Eze, meanwhile, was doing stuff Zane couldn't even start to understand. While Zane felt everything out—like putting white noise on full blast; he just had to bear it, withstand it—the guy was processing everything.\par
He was remembering every move, and the move after that, in sequence. So much a spike of hot pain was building in his skull. He must have one of those perfect memories or something. But still—once you got this deep there was just too much to remember. It shouldn't have been possible.\par
And yet…\par
Joy blossomed on the other side of the ring. And Zane's heart sank. Wait. Did he just…?\par
Eze smiled. \par
And lunged. And Zane defended the best he could; it wasn't enough. The man dragged him through a brutal sequence, a sequence that had his head ringing, his organs churning in protest as he struggled to get his chains up, barely blocking shot after shot—\par
Until, six moves in, he slipped up. And a Seismic Smash landed flush. \par
And flattened his face.\par
He hit the ground. He spun three times, splattered against the wards—and slid to a sorry halt. \par
When he picked himself back up, blinked the blurriness out of his eyes, he saw—\par
Warning! \par
Health under 75\%\par
Drat.\par
And his nose was broken again. A cheekbone might've been too, judging by the pain flaring up when he moved his jaw around. \par
There was nothing to be done about it—as for his nose… Zane just left it. He'd fix it after. He had a feeling it wasn't the last time it'd get squished. Folk really seemed to like punching him in the face. \par
The main issue now, he thought as he lurched to his feet, was Eze was ahead again. \par
But this race was far from over. Zane was already raring to go again, to give it another crack. \par
Eze studied him. "You take it well," he said. "Most of those I hit that cleanly stay down. Even top World Rankers."\par
Zane grunted. Zane could say the same of him. Eze was a lot less splattered than most folk who would have taken a meteor to the dome.\par
They grinned at each other.\par
And then they were at it again, racing through that deep dark forest…\par
One move. Two. Three. Strange thing—it felt a lot easier clearing these early bits. Zane wondered if his soul was adapting somehow to it—he was pushing it so hard, like a muscle he'd never really stretched in this way. Not comprehension… he was wielding it like a weapon, and it protested. But less and less the more he did.\par
Four moves, then five, and he was starting to feel the strain. He'd gotten so close to seven before—one more push took him over the edge, and there he was, hissing, gritting his teeth, as a burning tearing feeling lashed his soul; he wobbled, trying to keep his feet. The world spun under him.\par
And all that noise, all those screaming souls, got even louder—turned into a relentless howling everywhere, all at once; he was trapped in a raging whirlwind of feeling, of wants, running over each other hog-wild. He thought five was his limit but this... he could barely make sense of it; he could barely even think anymore.\par
Eze wasn't having a great time of it either. His brow was creased, his jaw clenched tight.\par
He wasn't giving up. He was still pushing, trying to hit eight—so Zane bit down and shoved too.\par
He felt like his soul was bleeding. It got so loud it felt like his heart might explode; he staggered, almost fell over; his jaw unhinged; he started screaming just to let all the feelings out. This was it—he couldn't stretch any farther; his whole soul was trembling, tearing—\par
If his soul was listening, it felt like its ears were bleeding. \par
He just refused to back down. \par
And then—suddenly—the sound shrank. \par
Or rather—it felt like his hearing got a lot clearer, all at once. His soul didn't get any bigger but his perception was suddenly so much sharper. Suddenly each layer came in stark focus—he could pick out those feelings again, tell them apart, keep it all together! His feeling just got… better. Like that. \par
Suddenly, feeling ten intents, a hundred intents, was just as easy as feeling one. \par
Skill up! \par
Sage Mind II -> III \par
He doubled over. He spat out a mouthful of blood, felt a sick lurch deep down in his gut… and he grinned. There—he felt it—the way ahead, one beautiful silvery note rising above the rest, drowning it all out until it was all that was left, the one true way shining over it all—Yes! \par
And Zane went for it. Explosions rippled the air. Essence and Law splattered the wards, made terrible war, as two hulking titans brutalized each other in the middle of the ring. They went toe to toe. Neither was willing to give a single step—until the seventh move.Unauthorized use of content: if you find this story on Amazon, report the violation.\par
When Zane snuck in a brutal Stormfire Smash. It sent Eze stumbling, gauntlets blasted apart, leaving him wide open exposed—\par
and Zane slid two Stormfire Smashes down the pipe.\par
Light and heat seared the air; a blast so strong it was painful to look at, like staring at the sun with the naked eye.\par
BOOM-BOOM!\par
By the end of it…\par
It was pretty clear Zane took the lead again. \par
Eze looked pretty shabby. He was easily under 75\% now—Zane would have even said under 50\%. A fair few bones were clearly broken—but more than that, his skin was melting off his body. A chunk of his massive chest was all caved in.\par
It was immensely painful; Zane could feel the sensation. Yet none of it showed on Eze's face. All the guy did was purse his lips—and nod. \par
When he smiled again he was seething. \par
Oh, boy. \par
That was another way they seemed to be the same—getting hit hard was supposed to scare people, supposed to deter people. But whenever they got hit, it only got them more fired up. They wanted to get it right back. \par
As they started prowling again, started delving into the future, both of them could feel the race was coming down to the wire. Who knew how many exchanges they had left? Four? Three, even? \par
Every one from here on out was critical.\par
Yet again Zane forced his way past the first few stages. They went by easily—with his new Sage Mind small crowds were nothing to him. \par
Once they got past seven though… once thousands of souls, thousands of intents came into play—he started to struggle a little again. \par
Eight, and he was really starting to strain… \par
But Eze was here too—and he was throwing everything he had at it. His mind was buckling under the weight of all those futures. \par
But he didn't have a a single ounce of quit in him. That man was stone cold determination. He would break Zane. He would prove he was the best! \par
They locked eyes again. And he could tell Eze was in tremendous pain—and Eze could tell he was, too. Yet… neither of them gave an inch.\par
They both knew from here on out it was a battle of sheer will. \par
A great fight was like a great dance—you had to have a partner who was game, who could push you to places you never thought you could go. Well—if he wanted to dance, fine. Zane would rise to it!\par
The moment he made it back eight moves deep, he was struck by an intense wave of nausea. A warmth leaked down his face—it was his own blood, down his nose, down his mouth… it wouldn't stop. Oh dear.\par
And the feeling all around him… it wasn't a storm anymore, but this restless sea of feeling swirling all around him—but he was making it through. He knew he could make it. It hurt like hell, but if there was one thing Zane believed in it was his soul. After that last Skill-up Sage Mind had been cranked up four or five times—he would hit nine first! \par
He was just getting close when he heard a laugh. He felt a shock of feeling, of essence, a brilliant spike of joy— \par
There was Eze… He was bleeding too, hacking out huge gobs of blood. But he was smiling a bloody smile.\par
His eyes flashed a stark purple. His soul swelled suddenly—\par
…Shit. Had he just leveled up his Skill too? He needed to—he knew he had to to win. So he did. \par
…This guy was a monster. \par
Then Zane remembered he'd just done the exact same thing. Eze just… responded in kind. \par
…Huh. \par
Was this what it felt like to fight him? \par
Suddenly a lot of things made sense. \par
"It was a true joy to fight you, Zane Walker," said Eze softly. Then he raised one giant fist. "You were my greatest challenger. I must thank you for a wonderful fight—truly, I'm deeply grateful… you've proven you can stand with me. I… had given up hope there was one like you. I doubt this is the last time our paths cross…" He paused. "But I'm afraid we've reached the end of this one." \par
Wait. \par
Was he implying…? \par
Well. Zane snorted and decided he didn't care. He grunted. And put up his fists. \par
It didn't matter what happened. He'd fight his heart out anyway. \par
Then Eze came for him. \par
Zane knew the future; they moved in perfect sync, unnaturally smoothly, as though in a dance. A very violent dance. Six moves in he was still holding up. Seven, and he felt okay.\par
The eighth shot was a Seismic Smash that hit him from an angle he hadn't even known was possible. He just hadn't felt it in time; it looped around the back of his head and smashed him there. The next thing he knew he was driven face-first into the canvas. \par
And the gauntlet held him there. The full weight of it bore down on his skull, forcing him still—the eighth shot was still coming. The real kicker. Blood and dust wiped out his vision but he could still feel the aura moving over him, dipping in a slow wide arc—an ordinary punch, not hurrying, not rushing… \par
It was a punch that needed a little time to run its course. \par
And Eze had finally found a future where there was just. Enough. Time. \par
NO! \par
Zane bucked with all his might, once, twice, forced the fist off his face—precious fractions of a second, burned away—he wrenched up a Chain just as the fist touched down.\par
It glanced off a Chain link—and hardly slowed at all.\par
He felt it coming, a yawning blackness opening over his soul, looming over him like a tsunami about to crash—\par
The fist landed square on his chin.\par
BANG.\par

Interstellar Bastion\par
Seattle \par
All was quiet outside the Interstellar Bastion.\par
Then, from the topmost floor, a scream rang out—so loud half the building heard it. It was Reina—they dashed up the stairs, shoved their way into the throne room. They all thought she'd been stabbed. \par
They found her sitting before an essence projection with her head in her hands. An essence projection of a big muscular man face-down in the ring. Unmoving. \par

A similar sound—less angry, more pitiful—rang out of a certain yurt. "Noooooo!" \par

"FUCK!" \par
Jason Walker smashed the ground in fury. \par
The force of it shook the whole tower. \par
Then he pointed a trembling finger at the projection. At Eze's stoic face.\par
"Whatever you just did to my brother's soul," he snarled. "You'd better hope that wasn't permanent. I swear to god—I'll gut you like a fish!" \par
To his side, D'Angelo Hall raised a brow. "Really, now. This is the same brother you called a useless waste. Didn't you say you shoved him off a bridge once?" \par
"That's different." Jason paused. Then looked side-eyed at him. "Very funny." \par
*** \par
It took half the folk at the Thousand Ray Desert rushing out in a tizzy for Avery and Evan to figure out what was going on. \par
They rushed over at once. Just in time to see it happen. \par
Evan screamed. \par
Then he tried rushing the stage—he didn't manage making it past the wards. He stood there pounding on it. \par
"C'mon, Zane!" he cried tearfully. "Get up! You can do it, I know you can!"\par
Zane did not get up. \par
***\par
Eze shook his head, turned away, and sighed. Frowned at the wards. \par
Then at the Coven officials manning the stage ringside. \par
"Why are they still up?" he rumbled. \par
"Sir Eze—" said one of them, a blonde lady. She scrambled to examine one of the crystals embedded in the flooring. She blinked. "It... the readings here say the fight isn't over… I'm so sorry—it must be a malfunction, we'll get this fixed as soon as we—" \par
Then Eze noticed she wasn't looking at him anymore.\par
She was looking behind him. \par
Her eyes began to widen. Her jaw dropped. \par

\section{122. The Touch of Death (V) }
\par
The punch fell the way night fell. An endless darkness settling over his world, settling over his soul. And he sank straight into it. Deeper and deeper… \par
He thought it would be a violent thing. Not at all. It was gentle, almost a tender good night; so tender he couldn't even rage against it. There was something almost beautiful about it. He once heard a quote about how it all ended—not with a bang but a whimper.\par
He felt a Law at work here. Less than a speck, the faintest whisper—but it was there, and it wasn't something he knew how to resist. He didn't even know what it was. It didn't feel like any Elemental Law. You couldn't even begin to compare them.\par
There was this aura about it…a wonderful, horrible aura. It had a certain grandeur, a certain dignity, that only certain very old, very beautiful things had. \par
He felt that in this little strand of Law. It suppressed everything—every other Law, every other particle; utterly dominating. And gently it dragged him away…\par

He was swaddled in the void, the nothing; he floated away from his body. All his muscles sagged and drooped at once. Even his heart. He went totally slack. The bright world fell away, a circle of light shrinking far above him, growing distant…\par
This must be what death felt like. \par
This utter numbness growing stronger by the second.\par
Warning! Health under 25\%\par
“…” \par
He'd been in this place before. This was what life had felt like before the Change. Before he got free. Before he started fighting in earnest—before he remembered what it meant to be alive.\par
He had been in the middle of such a great fight; it seemed a lifetime away now. \par
He didn't want to be here. \par
The circle of light started closing far above…\par
The darkness wanted to smother him. It wanted him to give. \par
And Zane said, No. \par
He wasn't done. \par
He still had a fight to get back to. A fight to win! \par
It took his body from him; it took all sensation—it even dulled his thoughts. \par
But it couldn't take his spirit. \par
He was still burning up with it. Burning so hot with sheer fighting will he almost couldn't bear it. A light that cast out the dark, that gave him new life— \par
He felt the darkness dragging him down all around him, grasping at his limbs, whispering to him even—that weird flicker of Law. Dragging him into oblivion. \par
And Zane refused. \par
He started forcing himself toward the light. Swimming his way up.\par
And the void fought him every inch of the way back.\par
It felt like he was at the bottom of the ocean floor, chained down by Law. But he didn't let it keep him down. He kept bucking, kept straining, kept kicking—and it only got easier the higher he got; the pressure started lessening; feeling trickled back to him. He let out a scream; a silent scream, a scream with everything he had. A scream of the soul. \par
Warning! Critical health! \par
Savage Body activated \par
Speed increased 50\% \par
Strength increased 50\% \par
Vitality increased 50\%\par
Then he broke through the surface.\par
He shuddered. He wheezed. Then he planted one fist on the ground, and hauled himself back to his feet.\par
Shakily, trembling, he stood. Through bleary eyes, he saw Eze with his back turned to him.\par
"I'm not done," Zane spat. \par
*** \par
The silence was deafening.\par
The crowd all choked. None of them seemed to be able to comprehend just what they were seeing. No one could even make a sound.\par
Then there was a gasp. And a little excited voice called out from the edge of the ring.\par
"I knew it!" cried Evan.\par
Eze turned. And blinked. And even he seemed like he couldn't believe his eyes; he stared wide-eyed. Then he whispered something in a language Zane didn't understand.\par
"..How?! I struck you," he whispered. "With Death itself. Flush. That… that is not something one can simply get up from." \par
Zane grunted. "I have a thick skull."The narrative has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\par
Eze stared. Then shook his head. "Extraordinary," he muttered. He kept staring at Zane, studying him. "Yes… there is something strange about your soul. For everyone else, that touch obliterates them. But for yours... It felt like punching a wall. A wall in the astral plane."\par
For a while, they just stood there.\par
It was clear they were both on their last legs; their bodies were broken and bleeding. Zane's soul must be meat paste in the astral plane. And Eze's mind was so shredded it hurt just to think. \par
"Well then." Eze pursed his lips. "Shall we have one last dance?"\par
They grinned at each other for the last time. \par
And then, they started to circle. \par
Eze might have his Touch of Death. But the thing was, now Zane did too—in a way. Wish Upon A Star was fully charged, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice.\par
Together they raced back into the future.\par
Now the game was simple.\par
Whoever hits nine moves deep first? Wins everything.\par
Zane's soul hurt. Eze's head hurt. They were bleeding in so many places you couldn't even tell where the blood was coming from anymore. And the deeper they got, the sharper the pain got. Their fighting spirits burned as fierce as they ever had, dragging up their exhausted souls and minds for one last run—\par
Seven moves in and Zane started dry heaving. Eight moves in, and his mouth was a waterfall of blood. He didn't care. He could feel himself getting close; could feel the path start opening up ahead of him, could feel him running up against the boundary—\par
The world started clouding over. Everything trembled before his eyes; the ground felt deeply unsteady beneath his feet—\par
He flung himself across.\par
And he fell to his knees.\par
His eyes rolled back. He hacked. He spat a lung's worth of blood.\par
But he'd made it. He knew it. There it was, nine moves deep—victory! \par
Then—at the exact same time—he felt a spike of joy across the ring. He looked up. \par
There was Eze; there was mirth in his eyes. \par
Then the path of the future starting warping right in front of Zane—growing cloudy—unclear—\par
And he knew.\par
Eze had broken through too. Nine versus nine.\par
For a moment, they just stood there. In stalemate. What to do? \par
Then they locked eyes. \par
Weird thing. Share a ring with a guy long enough, and you got to know him more deeply, more clearly, than almost almost anywhere else. \par
Everything that truly mattered about each other, they knew. They knew neither of them let themselves fear. They knew when you put them down they never stayed down. And when the pressure was greatest, when life or death was on the line, they always rose to the challenge. \par
Eze felt a sense of such fierce respect for him then—a feeling Zane knew was very, very rare for the man. And Zane felt the exact same way. It was a level of respect, of understanding you could only feel when you tested each other to the very limits. A respect bound in blood. \par
When they looked eyes, they didn't need to say a word; they just knew, since they knew what sort of man stood across from them. \par
An unspoken agreement passed between them. \par
They gunned it at the same time.\par
And they started destroying each other.\par
Letting the stuff of their hearts, the stuff of their spirits, pour straight into the battlefield in a show of beautiful, glorious violence. \par
Blocking and dodging, hearts soaring, throwing wildly, Skill after Skill stacking one on another—Five. Six. Seven. A gauntlet, smashing a meteor out of flight. A meteor splitting the guard; Eze, spinning away—Eight. And a star flared up in the sky. Shining with a brilliant passion, crackling and raging, blocking out the sun—\par
At the same time, Eze ran for him. \par
Ran for him, fist cocked back, swinging an utterly ordinary punch. A punch that had its own corona of sheer blacker-than-black; a punch that trailed voids; a punch that carried the power of life and death. And Zane knew if he got hit by this one…\par
This time he wasn't getting back up.\par
Nine.\par
The shooting star fell to earth. And the fist shot forth, arcing for Zane's chin—\par
Bang.\par
At the same time—\par
BOOM!\par
The world whited out. \par
It turned out Zane was right.\par
This time when it put him down, it put him down for the last time. He wasn't getting back up. It was over. He was blasted into oblivion—then yanked back as something outside of him, something working furiously, absorbed the rest of the force.\par
It was the sparring ring. That would have taken him past zero, it seemed…\par
So he'd lost.\par
He couldn't even be mad about it; he was grinning. He'd had a lot of fun. He was exhausted. It felt like he'd been flayed, beaten all over; even his soul had taken a bad beating. After this, all he wanted to do was sleep. It took a huge effort of will just to get up to a knee.\par
Then he saw the notification.\par
World Rank \#10 Zane Walker has been defeated!\par
Figures.\par
But then, right below—\par
Wait.\par
World Rank \#3 Emeka Eze has been defeated!\par
And just underneath—\par
Skill up! \par
Wish Upon a Star I -> II\par
Huh.\par
He blinked.\par
Double KO! \par
Verdict: Draw\par
Then the notifications started to spasm. Flicker. They faded out. Zane got a glimpse of a few Silicon Coven technicians working in a panic on the sidelines—\par
He and Eze blinked at each other. Both wobbly, both dumbfounded.\par
CRACK!\par
The ring split down the middle. The crystals on the side of it exploded one by one, showering sparks. And the whole 'King of the Ring' collapsed, spewing dust and sparking essence everywhere.\par
A silence.\par
Then—\par
The crowd erupted so loudly Zane almost blacked out. His soul was still quite tender right now—all that noise—all that joy, that feeling, that shock, that awe—it was enough to split his head.\par
He was getting swamped; he felt woozy, he had to make it out. The crowd was spilling over everything, shouting, grabbing. Across from him, there stood Eze. He looked pretty awful. Bloodied all over, hunched, swaying a little on his feet. Probably as awful as Zane looked. He put his fists together, and gave Zane a little bow. The guy felt deeply grateful. \par
Then he faded into the noise.\par
He was gone now, but Zane was sure this wasn't the last they'd see of each other. \par
Zane stumbled about for a little bit, feeling quite confused. He was getting grabbed quite a lot. Then he felt something tackle him—he almost keeled over. Then he found out it was Evan, wrapping him in a hug. He grinned, feeling rather drunk. He really needed a nap.\par
Then he felt a strong tug on his arm—it turned out to be Avery. "Alright, big fella," she said, guiding him along. "I've got you. Stay with me now! We're going to get right back to your hotel, okay? If you black out on me right now it's all over. If I try to lug you that far I'm gonna throw out my back or something."\par
Zane nodded blearily. His head felt very float-y right now, very light. He was happy. He had such good friends. It made him feel all warm on the inside. Well—Evan wasn't helping his mobility much right now, but Zane appreciated the intent.\par
They stumbled about for some indeterminate amount of time—it got less noisy as they went; that was all Zane knew, which he really appreciated. A big shadow loomed up ahead—the hotel? He felt relieved.\par
Then Avery stopped right in the middle of the road.\par
"Err," she said.\par
Standing there, blocking the way, was a very familiar figure. Zane grinned stupidly. He felt very warm in his chest seeing her. "Reina," he slurred. He stumbled toward her. \par
Then he felt how she was feeling; his grin slipped a little. He stumbled to a stop right in front of her. \par
Her arms were crossed. She glared at him. Oh. Oh no.\par
… She was mad. Really, really mad. \par
Then she saw him—the shape he was in—and so much concern spiked up in her she almost stopped being angry with him. \par
Still—her anger won out in the end. \par
"Uh," he said.\par
She arched a brow. "Well?" She said coldly. "Is there anything you'd like to say to me?"\par
"Uh," Zane said again. He was finding it hard to think. She was kind of scary like this. \par
He scratched his head woozily.\par
In the end, he decided to just take the easy way out. And blacked out, collapsing all over her. \par
\par


\section{123. Fans }
\par
Zane woke up feeling fine. More than fine—good, actually. Which was surprising because he'd gone out feeling like he'd been run over by a truck.\par
Even his soul—which had taken quite a beating—felt good. Whole, at least. There was still a lingering exhaustion but that was from Law Comprehension. All the damage he'd taken in the fight was just… gone.\par
Huh.\par
There was a warmth pouring into him; an essence that felt like being bathed in sunlight. Every cell of his body sang with the joy of it. His head lay on what felt like soft pillows. Something was softly stroking his head. He felt a soul very close by—a soul that was just gushing warm and tender feelings. Feelings directed at him.\par
And he was drinking something he realized; a sweet liquid trickled through his mouth, down his throat… he opened his eyes.\par
It was Reina. She held a little bowl to his lips. She seemed to be feeding him broth. She'd been fondly stroking his head—which lay in her lap.\par
This was pretty close to heaven as far as Zane was concerned.\par
"You're awake," said Reina, blinking. Then, in a rush—"How do you feel? Are you hurt anywhere?"\par
"No," Zane said. "I'm good."\par
"Oh!" Relief washed over her. She smiled at him. She had these cute little dimples and these warm brown eyes… she was really very pretty.\par
This lasted all of about five seconds. And then she frowned. Like she remembered just what had gotten them here in the first place.\par
And suddenly she started getting angry again.\par
Uh…\par
For a second Zane wondered if passing out again was an option, but he wasn't sure he could do it on command. Maybe he should've said he was still mortally wounded or something.\par
Then, to Zane's relief, she just shook her head. And started deflating again.\par
Zane wasn't sure what was going on. It seemed like it had been a few hours; she probably had some time to let things sit. She wasn't about to erupt anymore, it seemed like—it was a more low-burning kind of anger. Still, Zane watched her nervously. If things flared up he did not like where his head was placed right now.\par
Reina took a deep breath. "Look, I know you won't stop fighting," she said softly. She gave his head another stroke. "And I don't want you to. It makes you happy…I don't want to get in the way of that."\par
He was cautiously optimistic. So far so good.\par
She paused. "Even if every time I saw that guy hit you, I just—I wanted to—" she gritted her teeth and cut herself off. Then she closed her eyes and took another deep breath.\par
Zane was getting a little less optimistic.\par
"I…" she let out a frustrated sigh. "I want to be there. With you. So I can help if things go wrong. I don't want to sit here on the sidelines always hearing about it. Especially if you get hurt!"\par
"Uh—"\par
"I told you I was training second-in-commands to take some of the work. Things are running smoothly enough now I don't need to be there all the time. And now that Elias has built a portal, it's perfect! I could be with you more."\par
"Uhh—"\par
"You could do with someone watching your back," she went on. "My Signature Title gives me some of the strongest healing powers there are. And I can make shields with my Skills too—I can defend myself, you don't need to worry about me. You can just focus on you. Just… let me help."\par
"Reina—"\par
"And besides," she said. She held up a finger. She was just getting started. "Consider this. What if you're in a situation where—"\par
"Reina—"\par
"Zane, I promise this will make sense. You just have to hear me out—"\par
"Reina," said Zane, exasperated. "Okay."\par
"… What?"\par
"Okay," he said it again. "Next dungeon, we can go together."\par
Reina blinked at him, stunned. Zane got the feeling she had a whole speech prepared. Probably two or three drafts of it, knowing her.\par
It was always kind of funny to him how hard she tried to win these arguments. Considering, well, it was her. She could probably convince him the sky was green.\par
"First I'll finish up here," he told her. "I want to get my Fire Laws done. Maybe some of the Electricity ones too."\par
Then he could start upgrading his Stormfire—which wasn't even real Stormfire yet; it was technically pseudo-Stormfire. And it could already go toe to toe with elemental laws.\par
"I want to use the Dojos and their saunas. And that Hell Array. Squeeze all I can out of the...week... I have left here. Then we can tackle an A-ranked dungeon. Together."The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.\par
She kissed him. Then she was back to being Happy Reina again.\par
"Actually," she said after they pulled apart. "This reminds me. While you were sleeping, we got a message from a Scandinavian Guild—they have a custom Quest they want to issue just to you. It's to clear an A-rank water dungeon that's started leaking recently—they've had to evacuate all their nearby Safe Zones…"\par
She frowned. "It seems like a lot of A-ranks are starting to leak now. And the monsters coming out are as strong as B-rank bosses. Entire continents are banding together to make World Ranker teams, just to tackle them."\par
She bit her lip. "There's one in Alaska that might even spread down to us, if it gets bad enough… and the breaks are only accelerating."\par
"They are?"\par
She nodded. "The strongest fighters in the world—like you—" she felt a burst of pride for him as she said it—"Are still strong enough to deal with A-ranks. But what happens when the S-ranks start leaking?"\par
She was starting to worry again.\par
"I'll be ready then too," he promised her. He said it with such confidence it warmed her.\par
Then he finally looked around. A chandelier dangled above them. There were sofas that look like they could have been taken from a royal palace. Those velvet drapes probably cost more than his whole house did back before the change.\par
"Where are we?"\par
"The penthouse suite," she said. "It's your new room now."\par
"Huh."\par
"Someone leaked where you were staying," she said, wincing. "Only World Rankers are allowed in this hotel. Even then, we still got mobbed. Three dozen different Faction Heads came knocking, trying to land a meeting with you. After that fight... well. You have a lot of new fans."\par
"Ah." He blinked. "I… have fans?"\par
Then he remembered, belatedly, the guy from the Steel Law crater. And that boy he'd met in that one ice tribe up in the Cascades. He wasn't sure why this kept surprising him. He wasn't quite sure what there was to be a fan of, exactly.\par
"Of course you have fans," said Reina, and she was feeling proud of him again. "Look!"\par
She pointed to a corner of the room. There lay an assortment of flower bouquets and random treasures—vials of elixir, healing pastes, wines, even boxes of what looked to be chocolate. A neat stack of letters too.\par
"They seem like a good bunch," she said, smiling fondly. "They like how strong and determined you are. And how you fight."\par
Then she frowned.\par
"Well," she said, "Most of them seem like a good bunch."\par
Now she was full-on glowering. "Some of them do not seem to understand that you have a girlfriend," she said frostily. "But I've made that quite clear."\par
Why did she say it like that? She made it sound like she murdered them or something.\par
…She wouldn't... Right?\par
Reina was a very nice, caring person. He knew that. Something about the look in her eyes right now, though...\par
"Don't worry about all that," she said. She smiled and leaned down and kissed him again. She held his hands and snuggled up to him. "Everything else—the politics, the Quests, the fans—leave it to me," she said, sighing. "You focus on doing what you do best, alright?"\par
He nodded. She kept kissing him.\par
***\par
A few hours and a lot fewer clothes later, they stopped kissing. It was interesting. Dual cultivating was still a great way of getting Levels. Still one of the quickest for them, about equal to an A-ranked treasure. And a whole lot cheaper.\par
Partly this was because Mephisto's Pleasure Sutra had somehow become one of his highest Leveled skills. After this latest session it was Level 5, which qualified for 'high Level.'\par
Which was mostly due to Sage Mind. It was based on intensity, after all—and especially after the upgrade, his feel for the right thing to do got a lot more sensitive.\par
By the end of it—\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 104 -> 105\par
Reina, meanwhile, gained five Levels. She went from high 70s to low 80s. But they'd have to get her to Level 100 or higher if they wanted to do an A-rank dungeon raid. Well—a good deal over Level 100, just to be safe. It was important to do this as much as possible. Reina mumbled the argument to him with her head on his chest, floating in a warm haze.\par
***\par
Then they heard a few knocks on the door—\par
"Hey hey, it's us!" came Avery's voice. "Your favorite people!"\par
Zane got up in a bit of a panic, threw on a shirt and pants, and stumbled to the door. Reina took a bit to react; she was still kind of out of it.\par
He cracked open the door. "Hi!" said Avery. There was Evan with her too. She waved. So did Evan.\par
"You're alive!" she said, grinning. “Huzzah!” \par
"Yeah."\par
"I thought your fight was really awesome," said Evan.\par
"Thanks."\par
"So what'd I tell you?" she said. "I knew you two big lunks would get along! Eze went into seclusion by the way. He went right back to grinding Levels as soon as your fight was done. I don't know if that guy even sleeps. He said he likes you! Anyway—Evan and I are off to do more Law stuff."\par
"Yeah!" said Evan.\par
"He's making the final push. He's going to break through the Elemental."\par
Evan was very excited.\par
"You'll get it done," Zane told the boy, nodding. "I know it."\par
"Aww…" Evan flushed.\par
Just then Reina limped over, still wobbly. Zane winced. She took it like a champ.\par
"Sooooo. We just wanted to drop by to check up on you," said Avery. She gave him a little salute.\par
"I'm just glad you're okay!" Evan told him, blinking big bright eyes at him. "We tried coming earlier but you were still watching that horror movie. I don't like scary movies. I get nightmares really easily."\par
Avery gagged. She seemed to be trying to tell him something with her eyes.\par
"What?" said Zane.\par
"You kept screaming Miss Reina," said Evan earnestly. "You must've been really scared!"\par
“…”\par
Reina went very pale.\par
"Uh... aaaanyway," said Avery, alarmed. "Bye!"\par
And she quickly dragged Evan away.\par
***\par
Zane decided he'd spend the rest of the day at the Warrior Dojo, checking out that soul sauna Elias had told him about. The one that'd wipe out his comprehension fatigue. He was eager to get back to collecting his Laws. He could tell Stormfire had a lot of room to grow. It just needed more Fire and Electricity—and with the A-rank treasures he'd gotten from Elias, he was sure he'd snag at least one full Elemental set before VGI was done.\par
He thought about trying the Asura Hell Array and seeing if he could set another high score. But he figured he could do it after he made his Law upgrades.\par
It was decided Reina would spend about half her time here for the next week. Zane also suggested she start focusing on her Wood Laws—checking out the Wood Law treasure area here.\par
He walked her there first.\par
They got mobbed right out of the door of the hotel, even with a line of extra Silicon Coven officials acting as security. Then Zane flared his aura and did an impression of the look Reina gave when she saw other girls staring at him a little too long. It worked wonders; the crowd cleared out at once.\par
He dropped her off at the Wood law Area, which was called the 'Thousand-Year Grove'—a spray of lesser trees surrounding a very old-looking, very fat silver-leafed oak. There was a hollow cut out of the middle of it where Wood Law folk could meditate. He gave her Elias's A-rank treasure, and she got to it. \par
Then he was off to the Dojo.\par
It was on the way there that he got a notification.\par
This is a Global Notification\par
All C-Rank Dungeons have now been cleared!\par
Progress to Integration Phase 1: 82\%\par


\section{124. Gala (I) }
\par
Oh yeah. This countdown thing.\par
He remembered seeing it every time he checked the Beacon. Integration Phase 1, huh. What happened when it hit 100\%?\par
…Eh.\par
Probably not something he had to think about right now. So he didn't. He wasn't the type to ruminate. Most of the time he wasn't thinking of much; he just went about life.\par
***\par
The Warrior Dojo stood in the middle of a misty lake landscape. All around it, soft waterfalls trickled into serene ponds; pebbled stone paths snaked between them, leading to the main building. A tower of dark polished stone, spartan and clean. Its door was a giant oak block bound in steel, cracked all the way open. Statues of armor-clad warriors flanked the entrance.\par
Everywhere he went now he drew a crowd—but his Reina glare worked wonders. That, and his flared aura, meant there was always a nice little sphere of space around him.\par
When folk looked at him it wasn't with just respect anymore. There was also a sense of… awe? Folk dipped their heads a little as he passed; most didn't even know they were doing it. Stares and whispers trailed him everywhere.\par
***\par
He made it into the lobby, a clearing of clean-cut stones, and requested the soul sauna. The receptionist fell over herself trying to help. She gave him access to their top-tier sauna and reserved all the slots so it'd be private. An elevator took him up.\par
The sauna itself looked like a dormant volcano in miniature. And sure enough the lady said it was made of volcanic rock and 'living wood,' whatever that was. A cave mouth on the side led deep within; it was so steamy there he could hardly see. He stumbled his way to one of the pockmarked rock benches and sat.\par
It was scorching hot here—a comfortable discomfort. The steam here carried heat weirdly. It soaked his skin, but it went deeper too. He felt it scorching his soul. But it also invigorated him. Like it was steaming and scraping the tiredness out of him.\par
He sat there and just chilled. A few hours passed like this. By the end of it, he was feeling a lot fresher, seared raw.\par
That night when he went back home, only Avery joined him and Reina for dinner at one of the fancy hotel restaurants. Evan was still breaking through apparently. Which reminded him—he asked Reina if she could get a specific thing for him. She had lots of reach now, but it was still a bit of a stretch. She said she'd put out a call.\par
***\par
Two days passed pretty quickly. He spent most of it recovering until—by the end of it—he was nearly ready to start tackling Laws again.\par
The whole time he was in public, he kept his 'leave-me-alone' aura turned up. The few times it didn't work were when other top World Rankers really wanted to talk to him. At one lunch, a very friendly Norwegian guy came up to their table using words like 'diplomatic relations'. Reina took care of it.\par
She still spent a lot of her day on that kind of thing, shuttling to and from VGI. She had to integrate all that Tomb King territory too, which was slow going. But she'd put together a good team back at the Luminous Faction; they had everything under control.\par
During the night, he got most of his Leveling done. After two nights, he got up to Level 106, while Reina got into the high 80s.\par
In the meantime, Evan broke through Foundation. They threw him a little surprise party. It was, in retrospect, a bit of an unintentionally cruel trick—after he broke through, he'd been so excited to share it with his friends, only to find no one was waiting to celebrate with him.\par
So he went home all alone, feeling sad. And because it was Evan, who felt pretty much everything quite intensely, 'a little sad' still had him sniffling.\par
Then Evan opened his door and was greeted by a shower of confetti. "SURPRISE!" cried Avery. Reina smiled. Zane blew the little streamer toy that Avery forced him to blow.\par
It was just too much for poor Evan. He experienced such sensory overload—on top of a rollercoaster of emotions—he went "Wahhhhhh!". And promptly burst into tears.\par
It took him a while to calm down. He was still crying into his cake a little in between hugging everyone.\par
At which point Zane presented Evan with his gift. Which was a copy of a magazine event said he liked to read—not a special copy or anything, just one of the few that survived. It had been in some kid's backpack when the apocalypse hit. It was 'Weekly Shonen Jump, April 18, 2022 edition.' They paid a good sum for it.\par
Evan gasped. And stared. He grabbed it trembling. And burst into tears again. Zane couldn't even tell if he was sad or happy. But their 'Power of Friendship' definitely got noticeably stronger, so there was that.\par
***\par
Zane was walking back from his last session in the sauna when he made a detour to check out the Asura Hell Array.If you discover this narrative on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.\par
The new leaderboard went:\par
CAIN HASTINGS, 552 KILLS\par
 YUKI URABE, 703 KILLS\par
 EMEKA EZE, 758 KILLS\par
\par
So Eze had gotten up to the 750s. Wasn't he in the 600s just a week ago? Yuki, the other top World Ranker—who Zane hadn't met yet, he didn't think—was right on Eze's heels too.\par
It was a reminder. Everyone in those top few ranks still grew crazy fast. Last time Zane saw Eze, the guy had Elemental Earth and half of Elemental Darkness done. At this rate there was a good chance he'd come out of VGI with two Elemental Laws.\par
Zane planned to do the same.\par
Just then—"Savage Sage!" It was the technician manning the array, a young curly-haired man smiling nervously at him. "Are you making an attempt, sir?"\par
Zane shook his head. "Not yet."\par
He'd get his Fire Laws first. Then he'd see. He'd never been all that competitive, really. He was more interested in good fights. But somehow… drawing with Eze only meant their fight hadn't really finished.\par
When Zane gave it a go, he wanted that \#1 spot.\par
Tomorrow, Fire Law. Then Hell Array. Right now he had to go pick up Reina at the Wood Law area.\par
Tonight they were going to some kind of fancy ball Elias was putting on. Zane had been skeptical of it from the start but apparently all the top people would be there. And Reina convinced him all that 'networking' stuff Elias kept touting wasn't totally fake. At least—she said she'd do the talking if he liked. But he still had to be there.\par
Elias was talking up some kind of secret he'd discovered about the Integration Phases. He was making it out to be some grand reveal. But Zane wouldn't be surprised if it was just talk.\par
***\par
Meanwhile, halfway across campus… \par
World Rank \#43 Tanner Hammond had been a frat boy before the Change. He'd actually been in jail for a DUI when the blue boxes started popping up.\par
Then he found out he Leveled way faster than everyone else! And Bam!—before he knew it he was the ruler of his own Kingdom, a little stretch of Oklahoma.\par
Which he ran pretty much like a frat. So his life didn't change all that much. The main difference? The stronger he got, the more he got laid. Which was pretty fucking awesome.\par
He came to VGI 'cause Elias had said it was one big party. His goal was to bang 10\% of the female population here before it ended—and he was crushing it so far, he couldn't lie. He smirked.\par
He was just leaning against one of those weird rune stones on the side of the road, chatting up a girl, when he caught something out of the corner of his eye. And froze.\par
His head swiveled. His jaw dropped.\par
Holy shit. That's a ten out of ten right there!\par
Tanner never gave out tens. But this girl was drop-dead gorgeous. And that loose dress she had on wasn't fooling anyone. She was stacked. That fabric was struggling hard around her rack—shit was holding on for dear life!\par
He was staring. So were half the men on the street, but they were trying to be discreet about it. Tanner didn’t care. He was practically drooling.\par
"Tanner?" said the seven he was talking to. She tried getting his attention, which pissed him off. He put a hand on her face and shoved her out of the way; she fell crying out. Then he put on a winning smile and strode out.\par
“Hey there!" he said. "The name's Tanner. How's it going?"\par
The gorgeous girl looked at him—started smiling warmly, like that was how she greeted people by default. Then something about his face seemed to give her pause.\par
"You're Reina, aren't you? Reina," Tanner purred, lingering on the word like he was tasting it. Then he smirked. "A beautiful name for a beautiful girl."\par
He came up with that one on the spot, right off the dome.\par
She started frowning. "What do you want?"\par
“Well," he said with a smirk. "I don't know if you've heard, but Elias Ventor's holding this big Gala tonight—huge deal. Only Top-50 World Rankers are invited. Like yours truly."\par
He waggled his eyebrows, just in case she hadn't Identified him yet. "Seems you're just outside the cutoff. But don't you worry your pretty little head, okay? It just so happens I have a plus one! How'd you like to come with me?"\par
He gave her a roguish wink.\par
"I have a boyfriend," she said coldly. "I'm waiting for him right now, actually."\par
But he'd heard that line a lot before. "Oh yeah? But you don't have a Top-50 boyfriend, do you?" he said, grinning.\par
To his shock she didn't even bother responding. She turned up her chin and treated him to a look of utter contempt. Then turned on her heel and walked away.\par
He stood there flabbergasted. Did—did she just turn her back on him?!\par
A vein bulged in his temple.\par
What the fuck? \par
He almost blew up at her right then. Then—no, no. Play it cool.\par
So he plastered on his winning smile again and ran after her. "Oh, so the boyfriend's the problem? Okay. That's cool. How about this? Your boyfriend and I, we'll have a friendly spar. If he wins, I'll leave you be! But if I win you come home with me. How's that sound?"\par
She kept walking.\par
He twitched.\par
Now he was actually getting mad.\par
"Hey, what's your problem?" He snarled. He ran to catch up. "Why do you have to be such a bitch, huh?"\par
Now Tanner hoped her boyfriend showed up. He'd fuck the dude up right in front of her. Then they'd see if she could still act so high and mighty.\par
The more he thought about it the angrier he got. Actually, fuck that! He'd put this stuck-up bitch in her place here and now! He reached out a hand—\par
A shadow fell across him.\par
And a giant hand grabbed his wrist. And smothered it.\par
He let out a gasp—all it did was hold him, and he still felt his bones grinding together. What the?! \par
He turned around. And looked up.\par
Tanner was tall. This man was taller.\par
Tanner was big. This man was bigger.\par
Then Tanner saw the name.\par
Zane Walker\par
Signature Title: Savage Sage\par
Essence Level 106\par
Zane Walker. \par
Zane. WALKER. \par
He stared into those narrowed black eyes in disbelief.\par
All the blood drained from his face.\par
This… this was the strongest man in the world.\par
Here.\par
And Zane was looking very pissed. At… Tanner?!\par
Tanner was pretty sure he had a nightmare exactly like this once.\par
Then it hit him.\par
The boyfriend she was waiting for…\par
He had a very, very bad feeling just then.\par
It—it couldn't be—\par
"You were saying," said Zane in a deep, calm, tight voice. "About a spar?"\par
Tanner’s eyes bulged. His mouth dropped open.\par
Nothing came out.\par
Then there was a high-pitched sound like steam escaping a kettle. Which was about the only sound he could make, since he was shitting bricks.\par
"I accept your challenge."\par
Then four massive knuckles sank deep into Tanner's face. There was a CRACK! A mass of bones shattered as all the things that protruded on his face were flattened at once.\par
And Tanner went shrieking, spitting blood, spitting a fountain of teeth, one by one—flew a good twenty feet in the air—and flopped to a halt. In the branches of a tree on the other side of the road.\par
Through a haze of leaves and pain, he saw Reina’s face light up with heartfelt joy. She flung herself at Zane; they started making out passionately.\par
Tanner whimpered. And blacked out.\par


\section{125. Gala (II) }
\par
The gala took place on a hill in the middle of Campus, in a place called the 'Crystal Pavilion.' It was a sprawling crystal dome. It spread the moonlight in ghostly fractals over the perfectly trimmed gardens all around it. \par
Zane wore a suit custom-tailored for his size. Of course it was Reina who'd gotten it made for him—she'd had it ready a week in advance. It wasn't like an old-world suit, though it had that stylish flair. It was something between formal dress and a martial robe.\par
When he came out of the bathroom with it on, Reina stood there stunned for a good five seconds, mouth slightly open. Then she pounced on him and started kissing him. Then she got a little possessive when she realized other girls would get to see him like this. Which Zane took as a pretty good review.\par
He walked up the hill with Reina on his arm. She wore a dark green dress which reminded Zane of an old forest seen from above. It was elegant yet loose, easy to move around in. She was so beautiful Zane didn't understand how it was possible. He kept sneaking glances at her trying to figure it out.\par
When they arrived, a Silicon Coven official blared an announcement. \par
"World Rank \#7, Zane Walker! And World Rank \#68, Reina Torres!"\par
The string band near the statues screeched to a stop. The folk chatting by the fancy food tables, or sipping wine by the chocolate fountains, or walking the gardens outside all stopped too. And stared.\par
Then they got swarmed.\par
In the space of a minute an Argentinian lady, a handful of Europeans, an Australian, and a South Korean guy all scrambled over to introduce themselves; they were all gushing. Zane got the gist of it—they wanted their faction and the Luminous Faction to be friends. They even gave Zane free treasures for no reason Zane could tell—but he happily pocketed them. He picked up some B-ranked Law Fruit, some Law treasures, an ornate helm, even. \par
The talking he left to Reina. He just stood there and nodded and said things when he had to.\par
A few guys really wanted to talk to him though. One of them, a burly Englishman with a disheveled mustache, seemed vaguely familiar. But Zane couldn't quite remember where he'd seen the guy.\par
"I must say," said Cain Hastings. "It has been… a rather difficult few weeks for me."\par
He sounded a little choked up; his eyes were kind of wet. Then he shook his head vigorously; he flared his nostrils; his mustache trembled. "However! I shall persevere! And for that I have you to thank, Zane Walker!" \par
Zane was baffled. Had they met?\par
"You showed me," said Cain, "The futility of the path I followed!"\par
He chuckled ruefully. "Why—the moment I saw you achieve three hundred kills in thirty minutes, I knew I would never be the best again. Never! I daresay that was the exact moment I lost all hope!" \par
He cleared his throat. "I may laugh about it now, but… I must admit! At the time… at the time it was quite painful. I… may have shed a tear or two."\par
Zane was not sure how to respond to all this.\par
"But! It was the best thing that ever happened to me!" Cain continued. "I learned how pointless it is to compare oneself to others! There's no need for that. No—I must be the best version of Cain Hastings I can be!"\par
He thumped a fist to his chest; he was feeling all fiery again. "If I'd never learned that lesson, after that last… frankly brutal destruction our Nigerian friend wrought upon me… I would have given up altogether. But no! You have the word of Cain Hastings—I shall never surrender!"\par
"Okay," said Zane.\par
"Do take care, old boy," chuckled Cain. He gave Zane a pat on the back and left. \par
Wait. \par
Oh. Right. This was the guy who Eze beat up.\par
Zane wasn't really sure what he was yapping about, but he seemed happy.\par
Anyway.\par
Speaking of—Zane caught sight of Eze right about then. He stood there on the other side of the room. The guy looked miserable. He was alone, frowning a little, still as a statue. He looked kind of awkward actually. Nobody was talking to him—but he didn't seem to want to talk to anyone. He seemed like he wished the whole thing was over.\par
Zane had never really seen him comfortable anywhere in public. Except in a battlefield. Stolen story; please report.\par
Then Eze caught sight of Zane. And blinked. And started walking over.\par
The crowd parted before him, and soon they came face to face again.\par
"We meet again, Savage Sage," said Eze smoothly. He held out a hand, a slight smile on his face. Zane shook it.\par
"And this is your lovely partner?"\par
"Reina."\par
"Well met, Miss Torres."\par
Eze held out a hand. Reina did not take it; she just glared at the guy.\par
Eze blinked, shrugged, and turned back to Zane. "It was a wonderful fight," he breathed. "Since our match, you've given me a new… excitement, shall we call it? A new fire." \par
Zane could feel it. There was this sense of tension just when they stood next to each other; Zane was getting a little amped up too. Something about the guy just set off his fighting spirit.\par
"In the past few days I have gained two new Major Laws of Darkness! That completes the set. As soon as this…" Eze wrinkled his nose. "Gala. Is concluded. I will attempt the breakthrough."\par
"I plan to do that too," said Zane.\par
"I look forward to it." Eze smiled. "Do give the Hell Array a try. I'm quite curious to see how you compare."\par
Zane got the feeling the guy thrived on this kind of thing.\par
Eze bowed to Zane, then to Reina. And left.\par
"Hmph," said Reina. \par
After about an hour, Zane had gotten tired of all the talking. And he wasn't even doing most of it. Reina, thank goodness, was still warm and smiling and making everyone feel good. She could still go for a while. \par
Then there was a chime, and all the talking stopped all at once.\par
Elias got up on a dais in the center of the room. He wore a ridiculous robe—it looked like some kind of silver space suit. He cleared his throat and grinned.\par
"Thank you all so much for coming to this humble party of mine! Truly—it's an honor."\par
Tepid applause.\par
"You may be wondering about the announcement I've been teasing all week… well! I won't leave you in suspense, friends. It all has to do with this!"\par
With a showman's flourish he brandished something aloft. It looked to be a tattered leather book, its pages yellowed and fraying at the edges. Confused murmurs all around.\par
"This is a rather unique treasure," said Elias, eyes twinkling. "Furnished to me very recently from an A-rank dungeon. Get this—it's a diary. And not an earth diary, mind you! A diary from a certain 'Laithan, Star Paladin,' of planet 'Nomon.' A diary which has some fascinating hints as to just what's coming for us! Because you see—'Nomon' had been very much like Earth. A normal planet populated by humans many, many light years away. Then the Change struck—or as they call it, the Great Reckoning!"\par
He paused; he seemed to enjoy having everyone's eyes on him, holding everyone in breathless anticipation.\par
"And it went much like our own. Their planet was entirely transformed into dungeons, ranked F to S! And like us they began to clear them. And like us, they noticed something strange… over time, the rate of dungeon breaks and dungeon re-spawns was only accelerating. Soon it would overwhelm the planet! Their first theory was that reaching 100\% clearance—that was, taking out all the A-rank and S-ranked dungeons—would stop the bleeding!"\par
He shook his head. "But no. There was one last trial before the planet could stabilize. After they cleared the very last S-rank dungeon… there was one last dungeon to clear. A dungeon that only spawned after Completion hit 100\%—that is, after the last S-rank cleared. And this guy's notes make it sound like the mother of all dungeons."\par
Astonishment rippled through the crowd. Zane blinked too. But he sensed no deception from the guy—he seemed to be telling the truth. Huh. \par
"The Monsters—and treasures—were like nothing they'd ever seen!" Elias continued. "The sort of dungeon you needed a team of the very best in the world to clear. Alas... The diary ends there. Laithan died in this Superdungeon. Because his planet was stuck in a vicious civil war! They went into the Superdungeon divided, battling each other… and there they perished. So did their planet, soon after."\par
Silence. \par
"Clearly," said Elias. "If we want to survive this thing—and avoid the fate of our poor friend Laithan—we'll need to work together. First to tackle the 18 remaining A-ranks, then the 2 remaining S-ranks… and we'll strike out at the Superdungeon together! With how much the degeneration seems to be accelerating, the very best from every continent will need to assemble. And I'm happy to say we've already got our Asia team!" \par
He gestured to his left, grinning. "It'll be led by Yuki Urabe of the Cherry Blossom Order!"\par
Yuki was the only guy in the whole place not wearing formal robes. Just a paint-splattered T-shirt. He was a skinny guy. His hair was quite messy. He looked like he'd just crawled out of bed; he yawned and waved. "Yo."\par
"Then there's Somsak Srisuwan of the Bangkok Top Team!"\par
A fierce-looking man in a colorful rope headband nodded.\par
"And while they couldn't join us, Jian Shi Ming of the Shaolin Temple and Kalyan Ramanathan of the Tigers of Madras have signed on too."\par
Elias nodded. "Friends—it is up to us to rise to the challenge. To meet this existential threat head-on! And that also means taking advantage of our best resources."\par
Here he cleared his throat. Zane sensed a certain excitement start coming from him—which probably meant he was thinking of money. "Which is why I, Elias Ventor, hereby pledge that the Silicon Coven will always be at the bleeding edge in terms of resource treasures! As soon as we can afford S-ranks, we'll get them. And after VGI—which has been a bit of a trial period for all of you, a taster, if you will, of just what we can offer—I also pledge to open up our treasures to all World Rankers… for a discounted rate!"\par
Now everyone was staring incredulously. \par
"It is," Elias said, nodding. "Of existential importance that every single World Ranker takes advantage of the Silicon Coven's resources. Indeed—my heart bleeds when I think just how much profit I'm giving up with this discount… alas! I do it for the benefit of humanity."\par
At all the frowns people were giving him, he cleared his throat and gave a hapless little smile, a 'hand-in-the-cookie-jar' look. "Alright—perhaps… perhaps I do stand to gain as well. But I'm telling the truth! Let me say to all those present, feel free to audit this diary! It's open to all. The Superdungeon is coming. And it's obvious to all of us that dungeon breaks are only accelerating. All I offer is a leg up in the coming apocalypse! Take it or not—we'll still need to be ready." \par
Nobody seemed to know what to think. Everyone was looking at everyone else. \par
"…Well!" said Elias at last. "Lots to digest, clearly. Take your time! I've said my piece. Have a wonderful evening, everyone!" He hopped off the stage. \par
The pavilion exploded in discussion.\par
\par


\section{126. The Elemental Law of Fire (I) }
\par
Reina asked Zane if what Elias had said was true. When Zane confirmed it, she went into full worry mode.\par
She couldn't concentrate on anything after that. Her brain started going full speed; Zane could almost hear the whirring. Zane, meanwhile, felt pretty calm about the whole thing. He knew exactly who he wanted on his team if it came to it. Reina, Avery, and Evan. He figured if they were together, they'd be okay.\par
He tried to reassure her, tried to help, and by now he had a good idea of how to do it. When Reina got anxious, she had a habit of holding onto him like he was a big stress ball or something—even just an arm or a hand seemed to calm her down a little. Just standing there with her, being calm, talking her through it slowly and gently—it all seemed to help.\par
Eventually he convinced her they could figure out what to do about it tomorrow; it wasn't like they could figure out an answer overnight. They didn't need to—it sounded like this would all take a while to play out.\par
He knew there were a dozen or so A-rank dungeons just in North America. Plus the S-rank Marianas Trench.\par
The A-ranks weren't such a big deal right now; by the time VGI finished up, he and Reina could probably handle them by themselves.\par
As for the S-rank... nobody knew much about S-rank dungeons. Those might take a bigger team, sure. And the Super-dungeon was an even longer way off. They'd get to it when they got to it. When the time came, Zane promised her he would be ready to punch the things. There was no need to worry right now. It would be okay.\par
It seemed to work—by the time they got to the hotel and started cuddling, Reina was okay again. She still insisted on dropping by the Beacon and sending a bunch of messages—scheduling a bunch of meetings that'd take place over the next few weeks. But she wasn't worry-spiraling anymore, which pleased Zane.\par
The issue was she was too smart. So it was easy for her to worry about a lot of things. Zane was happy to make it dumb for her.\par
As far as he was concerned, there was very little that couldn't be solved by punching hard enough. At least when it came to dungeons.\par
***\par
Reina wanted him to make her forget about it all, and he did best, which turned out to be more than enough. A few hours later she was four Levels up and totally spent. She fell asleep relaxed and satisfied.\par
Then came morning. Zane yawned and blinked at the thin shafts of early-morning sunlight coming through the drapes. Then he got excited; all this future dungeon stuff could wait until after VGI. For now, he knew what time it was.\par
Fire Law time.\par
There was only one problem—Reina had taken her favorite sleeping spot. That was, with her head on Zane's chest, using him as her personal pillow. This was her happy place. Unfortunately, it made getting up to go do his Fire Laws rather hard.\par
He made a plan: he would do a sneaky transfer. He started gently sitting up, cradling her head, about to move it over to a real pillow—\par
She growled at him like an angry lioness. He froze.\par
She kept growling.\par
As slow as he could, he lay back down.\par
She made a happy noise, held onto him tighter, and kept sleeping.\par
He lay there blinking at the ceiling.\par
…Hmm.\par
He supposed this was his life now.\par
A little more than an hour later, she woke up. She didn't seem to remember any of it—she was back to being her warm self. She gave him a smile and a kiss, then went off to portal back to headquarters to do her politics stuff.\par
He wondered if she realized how scary she could be.\par
Anyway.\par
For Zane, at last—Fire Law Time.\par
***\par
The Fire Law Treasure Area lay on the other side of campus; Zane was pretty bad at reading maps—he used to get lost in amusement parks all the time. Eventually, he ambled his way there.\par
It was called the 'Lake of Fire,' which was a very descriptive name, actually.\par
Lake of Fire (A)\par
The deeper you go in the Lake of Fire, the hotter the flames, the stronger the Law of Fire. Only those who've mastered the Elemental Law of Fire may breach its farthest depths. This Lake was made by the breath of a baby True Dragon. It was preserved and transported here via the System.If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.\par
It looked like a normal lake, except all the water had been replaced with flames. Redder near the edges, streaked with yellow the deeper you got into it—the middle was white-hot. It looked like the surface of the sun. The crackling and smoldering and roaring got louder the hotter it was. Tufts of sparks carried on the winds, fluttering into the bright blue sky.\par
So he had to get to the bottom of this, huh.\par
There was a cluster of yellow dots in there on the mini-map—people already in there. He couldn't see them, probably because they were underwater. Under-fire? Could you even breathe down there?\par
You probably could, actually. When he looked closer, he saw the fire wasn't burning on anything. Just essence. It was a bunch of floating flames.\par
The whole place was fenced off with Spirit Steel wire. At first Zane thought this was a safety thing because of the heat; there was no greenery within a hundred feet of the thing, probably because it'd all burned down.\par
Then he realized it was an exclusiveness thing. When he got close, he saw a line stretching all around it. There was an entrance, but there were Silicon Coven folk doing ticketing. A blonde girl was arguing with one of the officials.\par
Lizzie Stanton\par
Essence Level 86\par
Class: Fire Archmage\par
Faction: Ember Legion\par
"This is ridiculous! I've got a VIP Pass!" She cried, waving a black-gold card in front of him.\par
"Miss," he tried explaining. "We're at capacity. You'll have to wait until someone exits—"\par
"And how long will that take?!"\par
They kept going back and forth.\par
Zane scratched his head. Elias had said all the Coven's resources were open to him. So… he could just go on through, right?\par
Shrugging, he went for it.\par
It turned out he didn't even need to say anything. As he got close, it was like he had a force field. The whole line scrambled to get out of his way. The ticketing official took one look at him, got wide-eyed, and bowed his head.\par
"Ah! Right this way, sir!"\par
For a second the blonde lady was furious—"Why does he get special—"\par
Then she seemed to identify him. And cut off mid-sentence, mouth slightly open. She flushed. "…Oh."\par
Zane just kept walking since no one seemed about to stop him. As he passed, he heard the ticketer say behind him—"Miss—there are VIPs, and there are VIPs."\par
Zane got the feeling it wasn't even about Elias's permission. Once you got to a certain level of power, it seemed like you could pretty much do whatever you wanted.\par
Zane got to the edge of the Lake. He hadn't even set foot in it, and he felt like he was on fire already; a wall of blisteringly hot air brushed him head-to-toe.\par
He knew his limit today would be something like two Major Laws probably. Then he'd take tomorrow off to recover in that Soul Sauna. And rinse and repeat until he cracked this thing. Sounded good to him.\par
He got out his treasures. First, six or seven B-rank Law Fruits. At this point, it didn't even really matter. His comprehension speed wasn't the bottleneck here. He chomped them all down; sweet, light juices dripped down his mouth. He swallowed.\par
Then, Zane got out the A-rank Law Treasure Elias had given him: the Phoenix Feather.\par
Feather of Astoria, Fallen Phoenix (A)\par
Fallen Phoenixes are the closest cousins to True Phoenixes. Godbeast blood runs in their veins. Like True Phoenixes, they are born knowing the Elemental Law of Fire. Their feathers are among the most potent sources of it in the universe. Handle with extreme care: this treasure is prone to eruptions. This feather was collected from Astoria, spirit pet of Vin Elin, Inner disciple of the Azure Flame faction.\par
It was slick red-yellow, big as his forearm, and it floated in its own corona of dazzling sunset light.\par
The moment he grabbed hold of it, it exploded. The force almost ripped it out of his grasp; he felt an instinct to jerk away like he'd touched a hot stove—but he held on.\par
It was a lucky thing he'd gotten a Perfect Steel Body first. As it was, the blast singed his face, sent his hair in a bit of a frazzled tizzy. But he was mostly fine. The Elemental Fire there was very volatile. It felt like it had its own will—he had to clamp down hard to wrangle it.\par
Just having it close made him a lot more sensitive to the Fire Laws around him. They flared up brighter, clearer, in his perception.\par
He took a deep breath and waded into the shallows.\par
The moment he did, the fires grabbed hold of him. They couldn't quite catch on his body, but the heat sank in fast. It felt like he was walking into one of those industrial-grade ovens, cranked all the way up…\par
It felt a little like wading through boiling hot water, but without quite as much resistance. No wetness either—just pure heat washing over him. The ground started caving in. The deeper he went, the more punishing it got. It was rather hard to see—just a bunch of bright flickering reds and whites and yellows. All he could hear was crackling and roaring. The only smell was smoke.\par
He didn't really need to go that far in yet. His Fire Laws weren't that advanced. Maybe for Elemental he'd need to push it, but for now this was plenty. He sat down, crossed his legs, closed his eyes. And opened himself up to feeling.\par
The more he meditated, he noticed, the easier it was to click into that detached, observing, curious, zen-like mode. One long breath, in and out. And the physical melted away, grew ghostly, intangible… he was there.\par
He was smothered by Fire. Soaking in it—he barely had to reach. There was so much to see he didn't know where to start.\par
He went for the way it was burning him. The way its heat sank into him. It was interesting—it worked even better because his body was a Steel hybrid. It spread easily through him, down through the core of him, radiating out to his toes, his fingertips… the longer he sat the more poured in and stayed.\par
He held up a hand and saw it reddened with heat—slightly glowing. Then its inner secrets came into focus for him; the Laws running up the color…\par
He felt like a cup slowly filled. Not with water, but with heat; it was pouring the burning of inside him. It fascinated him. It was one of Fire's simplest and most fundamental secrets—\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Heat Absorption\par
Huh. …That was easy. Almost a warmup Law.\par
There was a flip side to this too, he felt. An exchange; for his cup to fill, another had to empty. A give and a take. He blinked at his glowing hand again… he was pouring too. He saw the way a certain Law shifted along with the heat, giving it out unconsciously. But when he set his will to it, he found he could influence it. Flare it so more heat poured out, baking the air—or cut it off, sealing it all in…\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Heat Emission\par
He'd barely gotten started, and he was already halfway to the Major Law. Time was always hard to judge in Law trances, but he was pretty sure it'd hardly been an hour or two.\par
He kept on chugging.\par


\section{127. The Elemental Law of Fire (II) }
\par
Zane could feel the shape of the Major Law he was working toward—could feel what he was missing. There was something between Emission and Absorption, a missing link.\par
Frowning, he honed in. Started paying special attention to the way heat seeped into him.\par
He sensed a Law there. But it was hiding, too small to make out… the heat wasn't strong enough.\par
He stood.\par
Time to turn up the heat.\par
He started wading deeper into the Lake.\par
If you only had his Fire Laws, he'd be forced to turn back fast—right about where the reds started changing color, flickering yellow. The Fire Laws there got too intense; they ran over his own.\par
But he had Elemental Steel. So he shoved on ahead.\par
The deeper he went, the more they lashed at him, roasting from all sides; it felt like you were stuck in the middle of a churning furnace. The heat grew oppressive, all-encompassing.\par
But Elemental Steel held firm, stood proud; it warded off the flames. The Fire Laws, thicker and thicker, raged against it. Tried burning out a weakness, tried melting off his skin. But Steel held strong.\par
At some point, he crossed a clear threshold. The fire was now equal parts red, yellow and white, flickering back and forth. And now he felt deep underwater; a blistering pressure started mounting over him, running down his neck, licking down his arms.\par
He kept going.\par
Another few dozen feet and everything was going yellow. The flames began to shine; it started to feel like he was under attack—like he was stuck in the middle of a crowd of Level 80s or Level 90s, and they were all launching Fire Skills at him at once, slapping all over him, and breaking against his skin, singing his hairs, watering his eyes…\par
He kept going.\par
The farther he went, the clearer he felt those Laws—it got him excited; it pushed him on.\par
Soon he passed the deepest yellow dots on his mini-map. They were two other Signed—he felt them sense him. He felt them perk up in shock—wondering who this was breaking into the Lake's deepest depths. Depths no one there had dared to go.\par
He was almost at the very bottom now.\par
There he saw a pit.\par
A pit of pure shining yellow-white fire; it grew so thick here it was like a second lake at the bottom of this one. Here the fire clumped so thick it seemed an incandescent swamp.\par
Curious, he waded into it knee-deep.\par
In retrospect this might not have been the best idea. But with how big he was, Zane had learned he could get away with a lot. When he was curious he just poked his head into things; usually it turned out fine.\par
The moment he stepped into the pit, it attacked him.\par
Elemental Fire latched on, raking molten claws down his skin, scorching, blasting at him—Steel had to work to fight it off. For the first time his leg actually felt like it was on fire—felt in danger. His Laws couldn't block it all out—it was just far too hot. He could feel his skin coming off him already, feel his skin going raw. And it was Perfect Steel Skin, so it didn't peel off. It melted off.\par
He winced. Even he couldn't take this long, he knew.\par
But something weird happened as he stood there. The deeper it burned him, the more fiercely it burned him, the clearer he felt its Laws. Zane had never been one to flinch from pain. He shrugged it off; he was too fascinated to stop right now.\par
So though he seemed to be melting a little, he waded deeper in.\par
He got thigh-deep, then chest-deep, then neck-deep—and by then, it was like being flayed. He was literally neck-deep in it; he almost couldn't help but comprehend it. And with how hopped up he was on Law Fruit—and with that Phoenix Feather in hand—\par
It didn't even feel like comprehending anymore.\par
He closed his eyes. He opened his mind—\par
And it felt as simple as looking—and seeing.\par
He got it; there was no need to think about it, really. He saw the way the fire tried taking over his body, the way it tried to spread heat all over him. The way his Steel resisted it—the way it moved through anyways, but slower, seeping through the skin and the muscle and the bone… the way it moved slower and slower through each layer, through each material—\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Fire Resistance\par
Huh. Nice.\par
It almost felt like cheating. Getting two A-rank Law treasures around him, plus a bunch of Law Fruit, plus his comprehension…\par
Then there was one left.Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.\par
He started searching. And searching. And to his surprise, he couldn't find it—even with his head so primed for it, so crystal clear, he could see every little strand of Fire Law streaming around him. … Weird.\par
Then he had a thought.\par
He got the feeling he wasn't seeing it because it wasn't there. Not yet, at least. He had to let himself roast for a bit first. It just felt right. He wasn't even really sure why. But he trusted his intuition; when something felt right, it almost always was.\par
So he did. He sat there, cooking in that brutal heat until all his skin started sloughing off his body—until he was raw all over, and a burning blanket of pain spiked up all over him. His muscles were coming under attack; the Fire Law was breaking through, starting to ravage him, pouring it on—he felt it everywhere, viscerally, spreading even to the core of him, a brilliant heat, a heat like nothing he'd ever felt—\par
Warning!\par
Health Under 75\%\par
And then he felt it. He scanned the landscape of his body and saw it pop into view, so easy, so simple. He saw it and how the heat inside him was like the heat outside. The exact same temperature. The way they flowed into each other, absorbing, emitting, in perfect balance…\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Thermal Equilibrium\par
It really was like a 'eureka' moment—he saw it, and it clicked. So easy.\par
Then he felt a numbness down the whole left side of his body. He blinked.\par
It seemed his nerve endings were melting straight off his body.\par
…Probably time to get out of here.\par
He waded his way out, splashing that ultra-hot white fire everywhere, and came to a smoking, panting halt a few feet out from the pit. There he sat, breathing heavily, and that Fiery Renewal flared up; ghostly flames burned up and down his whole body.\par
Slowly, painfully, scraps of skin grew back on. He let it do its work. In the meantime, he closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and smiled.\par
Now he had everything.\par
Heat Absorption.\par
Heat Emission.\par
Fire Resistance.\par
Thermal Equilibrium.\par
They came together in his mind, making the shape of something greater. He was so mired in Fire right now it came as easy as breathing. He knew how it worked. And the powers of heat were his.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Major Law of Thermal Flux\par
Man.\par
He was pumped up.\par
It really was almost unfair. With how stoked he was right now he pretty much just had to make contact with a Minor Law. Then he had it.\par
Which meant he had three Major Laws: Scorched Wrath, Ethereal Flame, and now Thermal Flux.\par
He wasn't far from Elemental—just a few more to go. Two, maybe? He was a little winded, soul-wise, but still eager to go.\par
He leaped right into the next one.\par
First, he closed his eyes and just put out feelers. Tried to understand what in his Elemental Fire was missing. It was a lot easier now that he had so much Elemental Fire around him—when he put his fire up against it, it soon grew clear what was lacking.\par
He had a lot about fire's burning—even fire's beginning, with Ignition. What about how it ended? What happened then—and after?\par
He frowned. Then he kept probing. Just groped in that direction, all around him.\par
He got the feeling this wasn't really how you were supposed to do it.\par
Even for someone like Avery, who seemed to have a very strong sense of Laws, she had to do some careful mapping of what it was she wanted to comprehend. She had to know exactly what Minor Law she was shooting for; sometimes she studied up on it, memorized a bunch of facts about it, that kind of thing. If she was studying how water flowed she might spend a few days squinting at a river, drawing diagrams, studying the science, then swimming in it a little, feeling it out, that kind of thing. She understood it every little bit of it. Only then could she have a solid foundation to break through.\par
When Zane told her how he went about things, she started hitting him with a spoon.\par
Once Zane saw some poor electric cultivator hooking himself up to a battery treasure with jumper cables and shocking himself over and over until he couldn't take it anymore. Another few months of this, he said, and he'd be ready to tackle the Minor Law of Shock.\par
This all seemed a bit much to Zane. It was the same Law Zane had gotten in an afternoon by scratching his head and thinking about it a bit. When Zane suggested it to the guy he'd gotten a blank stare.\par
Zane usually kind of just blundered around until he got the Laws he was looking for. Which hadn't failed him so far. So he kept doing it.\par
Anyway. He was having trouble finding it around him—but when he put out a probe, the Phoenix Feather in his hands started calling out to him. It had something it wanted to show him.\par
So he opened his mind to it.\par
A vision unfurled before him, smudged like an impressionist painting. But the Laws he felt as vividly as though they were real.\par
It was a world reduced to mounds on mounds ash, running into the far distance—still smoldering from recent fires. Above hung a blanket of slate-gray clouds streaked black. And far above even that, essence flared up in massive spikes.\par
A battle was underway.\par
There was a furious dragonlike roar—a blast of essence.\par
Then a shrill, mournful cry.\par
A streak of flaming red hurtled to earth. It was a phoenix—a magnificent creature, sleek and bright-red all over—except for a few streaks of yellow under its eyes. Somehow he knew it was the same phoenix his feather had come from. \par
It was spinning out of control; screeching, struggling, failing; huge gashes tore up its body. Gashes infested with some unknown Law, gashes that cut to the heart of it. A Law so complex Zane couldn't even understand what he was seeing. It had something of Darkness Law in it—but also Water; and when the two came together, they made something totally different, uniquely destructive…\par
The phoenix bled sputtering dying flames as it fell.\par
Then it crashed, at last, into plain desolate earth. And lay there. It closed its eyes for the last time.\par
It erupted in brilliant flame.\par
When they burned out, there was nothing left. Just ash.\par
And yet… the scene didn't fade.\par
Now that Zane looked close, he saw there were still Fire Laws lingering in the ashes—shimmering, powerful Laws.\par
He frowned. Paid closer attention. The Laws didn't go away. They'd stay there forever, he suddenly knew. Because they represented a simple truth—what was destroyed in fire cannot be returned. Fire was the great leveler; it made ash of everything. Flattened all the wonderful uniquenesses of the world in a single dull pile. Gone, forever.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Eternal Ash\par
But then—\par
A fuzzy little head started poking out of the ashes. Two big bright eyes peeked out. A phoenix chick.\par
How could a phoenix defy the Law?\par
But it wasn't defying the Law. Because this bird was not the same bird that died a few seconds ago; you could see it in the markings around its eyes, bright yellow, streaking up, not down. This thing was reborn—because though what was destroyed cannot be remade, its remains, its legacy, can help spur the growth of the next generation. With phoenixes and wildfires alike—sometimes you had to burn down the old to make the new. That was a basic mechanism of the Universe.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Ashen Renewal \par
It was a cute little bird. Zane kind of liked it. It was once they started flying when they became trouble, he decided. This one was okay.\par


\section{128. The Elemental Law of Fire (III) }
\par
Two Laws at once. It gave him twice the joy when he saw those notifications pop up.\par
But twice the fatigue too. It clubbed him over the head; he blinked, shook his head, clearing out the feeling.\par
He felt a sudden urge to yawn. Going fast was taking a toll.\par
For now, though…he wasn't done yet.\par
He closed his eyes, hunkered down. And opened up his soul again. He reached out to the Phoenix Feather, felt it glow brighter, felt it start to resonate…\par
The scene shifted again. Still hazy, as though in a half-remembered dream.\par
A world of lush soft greenery. Young spindly trees, plains of thigh-high grass. A gentle breeze rippled through, stirring the leaves… it looked oddly familiar.\par
Then Zane realized—that was because it was the same. The place was the same, if not the time; he saw the same slopes—the hills, the valleys—they were just peppered with new life now.\par
The largest thing there was a gnarled oak tree. And there was a nest atop its highest branch. There he saw another familiar figure—the phoenix. Those same distinctive marks lay around its eyes. But the thing was bigger.\par
It was sleeping. Snoozing, snoring out little spurts of fire. It was… cute.\par
The fact that Zane could find a bird cute was mildly disturbing to him.\par
Anyway.\par
It lay there, its fluffy bright body rising and falling…\par
Then its eyes snapped open; it snapped upright, staring alarmed at the sky.\par
There came a distant roar. A familiar roar. The same roar that'd rung out before its last life plummeted from the sky, fatally wounded.\par
And a dragon climbed out from the clouds.\par
It was one of those dragons that looked like pythons crossed with centipedes; a bunch of short stubby legs, a very long scaly tube of a body, no wings. Its massive body looped over and over as it descended. It snorted a tuft of blue fire. Its white whiskers bristled menacingly.\par
He'd seen it do its nasty work in that last vision. It had come to finish the job.\par
The phoenix let out a screech of its own. A challenge. And it rose bravely to meet the threat.\par
The dragon's jaw unhinged—and out poured a whirlwind of wild blue fire.\par
At the same time the phoenix beat its wings. A single Skill rushed out, a ripple of essence shining with a very specific Law. Zane paid close attention.\par
The ripple passed the fires—and quenched them instantly.\par
A wet blanket of a Law smothering those flames down to their sources, giving them no space to burn, forcibly suppressing them—climbing to the dragon's throat. Making it choke, eyes bulging.\par
And the phoenix shot up to greet its nemesis. It became a beam of Light; there was a massive ripping sound. A geyser of blood scorched the air. The dragon plummeted, thrashing, its throat torn open…\par
The phoenix rose higher, glowing brighter, singing a trill of triumph.\par
The scene faded away.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Total Extinguishing.\par
Zane blinked—and he was cross-legged at the bottom of the Lake of Fire once more.\par
He had all he needed. Only thing was, he could feel the crash coming on, could feel his soul start to fray… Time to bring it all together.\par
Minor Law of Eternal Ash. Minor Law of Ashen Renewal. Minor Law of Total Extinguishing.\par
Swirling around each other in his mind, locking closer and closer in place—\par
Then he saw in an instant where they all fit into each other, completed each other. He saw the bigger picture. It clicked. Just like that.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Major Law of Ashen Legacy.\par
He had five now. One more Major Law, and that was all of them. He was still eager to go—\par
Then fatigue clocked him over the head.\par
This time he couldn't help but yawn. When he tried climbing back into that zen-state he felt his thoughts turning to spaghetti, as though he were severely sleep-deprived.This tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.\par
He frowned.\par
Yeah… he was done for today.\par
Still, he was very satisfied with his progress.\par
***\par
He spent the rest of his day recovering in the soul sauna. It felt like sprinting; his soul felt winded. As he lay there the sauna stretched out his soul, massaging it, working out the sore bits…\par
Without this thing—and all his top-class treasures—an Elemental Law could take a month for him. Maybe more, honestly. Zane knew Elias had been splurging for VGI; when he asked Reina if they could have their own sauna like this, she'd said these saunas were powered by a rare B+-ranked treasure called 'Yellow Springs Mists'. Even Elias didn't have enough to last long.\par
Zane would make the most of all this while he could. He nodded, determined.\par
Tomorrow Elemental Fire would be his.\par
***\par
That night in their hotel room, Reina updated him on what was going on.\par
Central and South America were making their own team. So was America on the East Coast. They were headed by World Rank \#2 D'Angelo Hall. And World Rank \#4 Jason Walker.\par
Here she paused.\par
"Elias proposed an all-American team, but…"\par
Somehow Zane knew what she'd say before she said it.\par
"Jason—your brother—he vetoed it."\par
Zane grunted.\par
"He said," Reina said softly, watching his face carefully. "It'd make things too easy for you. He said he'd see you at the top."\par
Zane stayed silent.\par
Reina was too. They stayed that way for a while. They'd never really spoken about Jason.\par
"I don't like him," Zane told her. Which was all he really wanted to say on it. She nodded and didn't pry, even though he could feel she wanted to. She was smart like that.\par
The West Coast team, then, was pretty much just Zane and Reina and Avery and Evan.\par
"That will be plenty," said Zane with confidence.\par
Especially after tomorrow.\par
***\par
Tomorrow came soon enough.\par
He spent most of the day finishing up his recovery. Soaking in the soul sauna. He came out late in the afternoon.\par
He went straight for the Lake of Fire.\par
Somehow it'd gotten out that he was planning on breaking through to Elemental Fire—there was a line to get in. Then there was a line outside that line where folk—lots of folks from Fire Factions, interestingly—were camped. There were tents and binoculars and everything; he had the surreal experience of walking by a cookout where two guys were grilling skewers, discussing when he'd make his breakthrough. One of them was insisting it'd be tomorrow right as he passed by; the guy choked mid-sentence.\par
There was lots of cheering and shouting as he went. It felt like they were at a sports game and he was the home team. He was pretty sure he'd never met a single one of them before. Before VGI he might've found it kind of weird; now he was used to this kind of thing. Now he just found it amusing.\par
He took his Law Fruit; he grabbed his Phoenix Feather. And he waded straight in. He went for the hell pit.\par
This time the Fire Laws there had trouble even getting past his skin. It spoke to how close he was. He found a spot, crossed his legs, closed his eyes. And started to meditate.\par
This last Law escaped him for a surprisingly long time. It wasn't quite strong enough in his surroundings or in himself. So he closed his eyes and opened up his soul and let it go wherever it liked. Sought out the gap in his feelings and let the Universe fill it.\par
The Phoenix Feather started buzzing with Law; so did the Fire around him.\par
He let himself dissolve.\par
Two visions flitted by in quick succession…\par
He seemed to be in a very cluttered workshop; bronze gadgets were scattered over the workbenches, making a minefield of the floors. Soft sunlight filtered through dusty windows. Zane saw frizzy-haired, bushy-browed young man sitting at a long worktable.\par
"Here, Little Red!" the man called. "Here, girl!"\par
Then Zane noticed the phoenix perched above them—sitting on one of the rafters. It hopped down, fluttered once, and came to a halt right beside him. It was the same phoenix, and yet not, Zane knew. Another one of its many lives.\par
The man pointed at the table—at the two steel plates he had side-by-side. "Fire!" he called.\par
Little Red opened his mouth. Elemental Fire poured out. Very controlled, a single beam of it tracing the line between the plates. After it passed they shone bright. Welded together.\par
"Good bird," said the man, and gave Little Red a head scratch. The phoenix cooed softly.\par
Zane was feeling very conflicted right now.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Hot Fusion\par
The scene faded out. A new scene faded in. For a second Zane thought it was the same scene—the same rafters, the same workbenches.\par
But rather than cogs, there lay flasks scattered about. A furnace stood in the center of the room. No-one was there.\par
Then two men came in through a side door. One was old and frizzy-haired and a little cranky, like he'd just been woken from a nice nap for this. The other was an excited teen boy.\par
"What is it?" said the old man.\par
"The brew's almost done!" said the boy.\par
"I've heard that before," the old man grumbled. But he said it in a good-humored way.\par
"This time I mean it," the boy insisted.\par
He scrambled over to the furnace. "Here, Little Yellow!" he called. And a phoenix swooped down from the rafters. The same, yet not.\par
There was a flicker of pain in the old man's eyes; it passed quickly.\par
"Alright," he said, crossing his burly arms. "Let's see it."\par
The boy pointed. "Fire!"\par
And the phoenix gave him what he wanted. The cauldron lit up—its ingredients heated up. And something about Elemental Fire seemed to unlock them; soften their hard edges; coax out their energies, their essence, so they could mingle freely with one another—and what came out was something new, a milky broth swirling within, glimmering gently.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Fiery Transmutation\par
"It worked!" cried the boy. "Grandpa, it worked!"\par
Laughing, the boy gave the phoenix a pat on the head. It cooed softly.\par
The old man blinked. Then gave a little smile. "Well. Isn't that wonderful."\par
The scene faded.\par
There was Zane again at the bottom of the Lake, blinking.\par
…Hmm.\par
He felt conflicted for a bit. Then he settled on the only possible explanation. Some birds looked like birds, but they weren't birds on the inside. That was not a real bird, he decided. So it was okay for him to like it.\par
Anyway. He sensed he had all he needed—the last Minor Law was something he'd already comprehended. The Minor Law of Fire's Purity, which made up Ethereal Flame, would help him here too.\par
Once you put Fusion, and Transmutation, and Purity together…\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Major Law of Incendiary Alchemy\par
Now to put everything together.\par
Scorched Wrath. Ethereal Flame. Ashen Legacy. Thermal Flux. Incendiary Alchemy.\par
A fierce element, a proud element—a passionate element, a wrathful element; an element that lay waste to the world like no other, that destroyed its victims so badly they could never be re-made again. Yet…it turned its temper on the bad as well as the good. It could sear out poison as easily as it could raze a city. Burn a man alive just as it could warm him on a winter's night. It lit the stove-tops and the cauldrons, lit the torches and the cannons, fueled engines and volcanoes alike. It was the power that lit the very stars. It was hate. And it was hope.\par
Zane opened his eyes.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Elemental Law of Fire\par


\section{129. The Elemental Law of Fire (IV)}
\par
There was a fluctuation of Fire Law. A passionate blast of a note. It ripped through the air, touching the souls of all those around him—an echo of his revelation. Spreading, spreading… \par
*** \par
"Shit," whispered a burly man—World Rank \#58 Danny Jacobsen. "I think it's coming, you guys!" \par
He'd been a welder up in Ohio before the Change; wielding fire had come naturally to him. Now he led one of the biggest Factions in the midwest.\par
He'd come to VGI for the same reason everyone else did—so he experience the best the world had to offer.\par
It was what brought him here too. Camped outside the Lake of Fire, staring out through his seeing-glasses like all the rest of them—waiting for their chance.\par
Until he spotted a strange phenomenon.\par
Streams of Fire Law started spiraling down the middle of the lake, crashing down on just one man…\par
Folk started gasping, scrambling to their feet—\par
"No way…” \par
“Zane Walker’s done it again!” \par
"Get ready—here it comes! Take your Law Fruit, everyone!" \par
There were many there like Dan. A few paces away from him was a blonde young woman in huntress's leathers—World Rank \#79, Lizzie Stanton. \par
She led the Ember Legion, a Faction that covered most of Maine. It was her first time out of the northeast; the West Coast, VGI, all the flashy events, all the powerful folk gathered here—it was all very exciting for her. She was ooh'ing constantly; she felt like a bumpkin. \par
She'd been waiting in line for the Lake of Fire when she saw Zane Walker stroll by right in front of her.\par
It'd been a bit of a shock. Coming from where she'd been she'd never seen someone that high-ranked in the wild. She'd heard stories of him, of course. He looked larger than life, with tousled dark locks and strong handsome features. He had this aura about him… it took her breath away. \par
She'd rushed over the moment she heard Zane was attempting his breakthrough—she'd joined the rest of the Fire cultivators camped outside, watching, waiting, until—\par
Elemental Fire splashed out from the center of the Lake. Spreading fast. The purest distillation of it, one bright wave— it doused all of them.\par
And for a split-second, every single one of them had an impression of it shining in their souls. A clear, vivid image of true Elemental Fire. \par
Folk cried out in joy. Then there was a huge shuffling as they all sat down and closed their eyes and try to absorb what they'd just witnessed.\par
***\par
A mile away, at the bottom of a gorge hundreds of feet deep, Emeka Eze sat meditating. Soaked in Darkness Law. He too was trying to break through. \par
Then he felt it. That telltale pulse of Law… he shook his head, sighed. And smiled. \par
So he'd lost the race. \par
Zane Walker was a true monster. \par
Eze had gotten a head start on his Darkness Laws. He'd almost finished them; he thought he'd break through first, keep his shrinking edge… but no.\par
Emeka Eze had met some of the strongest folk in the world. But he'd never met someone he thought he couldn't catch, couldn't beat. At anything. \par
Then came Zane. In the realm of comprehension, Skill or Law… that man could not be touched. At first Eze had thought he was only slightly more talented.\par
Now, though—it was clear that was Eze's pride talking. Zane’s soul was in a league of its own. There was no competing with him in the realm of Law. \par
If Eze wished to defeat the monster known as Zane Walker, it would simply have to be via Leveling. In that, at least, Eze knew he still reigned supreme. \par
Eze closed his eyes again, hunkered down. And threw himself back into his breakthrough with double the fervor, still smiling. \par
He felt quite grateful to Zane Walker. That man brought out the best in him.\par
***\par
Half a mile away, there was a desert of shining sands. The sands glowed silver with moonlight at night and gold with sunlight in the day.\par
There, two top World Rankers sat side by side. Well—one was sitting. Evan Armstrong sat criss-cross, happily building a sandcastle.\par
Beside him lay Avery Lively. Face-down, sprawled spread-eagled, unmoving, still in her hoodie despite the baking heat. She was convinced this was the optimal Law comprehension position. Evan didn't question it; he didn't question much, to be honest. Most of the time he was just happy to be there. The narrative has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\par
They both perked up at the same time.\par
Avery grinned. "Heyyyy!" \par
Evan gasped. Then beamed. "He did it!"\par
*** \par
The message spread from listening crystal to listening crystal, crossing the continent, crossing the oceans. Before the hour was over, everyone important got the news.\par
The first man to break through to two Elemental Laws was Zane Walker.\par
This time most of them weren't totally floored, like they'd been the first time. The French \#1, the Necromancer Matthieu Lagrande, let out curse that echoed about his throne room. The Korean \#1, the Lightning Berserker Sungwon Choi, choked on his soup when he heard it—then shook his head, chuckling in disbelief. \par
They all knew his name by now, of course. Zane Walker might not be ranked number one in the world, but in recent weeks his name had popped up in a certain debate. A debate which played out in idle chit-chat around campfires. As well as in secret meetings of world-power Factions. \par
Who was the strongest in the world?\par
It was a debate that'd gotten very lively lately. \par
The difference between Zane and the other top contenders was they'd all been there almost since the very beginning. Zane's rise was so fast it gave them all whiplash. It inspired fear and awe alike. \par
*** \par
Naturally, Zane wasn't aware of all this. He came out of the Lake of Fire feeling pretty pooped. But there were just a few more Comprehensions he wanted to do; he wanted to start playing with his new power.\par
So he got back to his hotel room, plopped down on the fluffy bed, and took out the 'essence of morning dew'—the soul recovery treasure he'd squeezed out of Elias. The one that'd let him overdraw a little, like an energy drink for the soul.\par
He chugged down what was left in the vial.\par
The foggy murkiness in his head started to clear; a new buzzy energy poured into his soul.\par
He closed his eyes. And started thinking of Stormfire. Right now, it had just a few Fire Laws and Electricity Laws mixed in…\par
He added more. He wove in Incendiary Alchemy, and Thermal Flux, and Ashen Legacy, slowly but surely. Until he fed in all of Elemental Fire.\par
Then—\par
Skill up! \par
Pseudo Stormfire (Legendary -> Mythic) \par
He noticed something interesting.\par
Now that he'd thrown in all of Fire and some of Electricity, he was a good way toward True Stormfire. And yet…\par
Stormfire wasn't just a blunt mix of Fire and Electricity, he was realizing. True stormfire, at least. Even if he threw in all of Elemental Electricity in there too, there'd still be a pretty big gap.\par
It wasn't a gap of power. It was a gap of understanding. Because you couldn't just throw two Elements together willy nilly, he was realizing. There was some kind of… Law glue…? He had to understand how they came together. True Stormfire wasn't just Fire plus Electricity; it felt like more than that. \par
Only… Zane didn't know what that even meant. \par
He could feel the gap in his understanding. But he didn't have a clue how to go about filling it.\par
But he could tell they'd be a lot harder to grasp than Minor or Major Laws. They were more advanced than Elemental Laws; they governed their interactions. They were more like… concepts?\par
As far as he could tell, he was the first person on Earth to make it this far. He was in uncharted territory now; he had to figure it all out for himself.\par
He winced. He could feel the Morning Dew starting to run out; he could feel a huge wave of fatigue lurking in his subconscious, just out of sight, about to crash all over him… Just a little more. He had to push. \par
The last thing he set his mind to was throwing his new Stormfire at Apocalypse Smash. Luckily, the upgrade didn't take much effort.\par
Skill up! Apocalypse Smash [Mythic -> Mythic+]\par
Then he got a notification.\par
This skill's power has been assessed to lie beyond that of any Mortal Grade skill. It exists on the borderline between Mortal and Earth grade. As such, it has been assigned the grade of Mortal Mythic+.\par
Zane blinked at it. Huh.\par
Mortal? Earth? He vaguely remembered hearing those terms before. He wondered what it meant in terms of power—\par
He felt a sharp twinge.\par
And hunched over gasping. A horrible migraine was coming on fast, spiking his head full of white-hot pain; at the same time, the last of the Dew gave out. His fatigue came crashing back over him.\par
The combination of the two had him wobbling; he almost retched. It took him a moment to clear his head and figure out just what had happened.\par
He'd pushed a bit too far. Gotten a little over-eager. It was like he'd pulled a muscle, but the muscle was his soul.\par
He groaned, massaging his temples. A wave of red-hot pain washed over him, receded, washed over him again, throbbing over and over, making it hard to think.\par
Yeah—in hindsight, probably not such a good idea to push that hard… lesson learned.\par
***\par
Zane spent the rest of the day recovering, trying to get the tide pool of pain in his head to go away. He'd take at least the next two days off, he figured. He always had a suspicion too much thinking was bad for you.\par
A few hours later, he felt a ripple of pure distilled Elemental Darkness. Someone had just broken through.\par
***\par
It was evening when he left the soul sauna. He couldn’t stay in there forever; he ended up feeling raw and scalded all over. He’d hit it again tomorrow. \par
He found himself with a little off-time. He usually filled this time of night with Reina, power Leveling, so to speak. But she wasn’t here; she had a meeting with a few of the big Islander Factions. An alliance of them had sailed over, just to meet with her—they wanted to offer Zane a custom quest, apparently. Something to do with helping to clear one of their tropical A-rank island dungeons. \par
For now, Zane just wandered about. He ended up coming across Evan, coincidentally—Evan had gotten bored of all that training and was just out and about, taking a walk. He was very happy to see Zane. Zane ended up buying him a ham sandwich; they just took a leisurely stroll of the pretty, nature-stuffed campus, munching on their sandwiches. \par
They passed by a massive crowd bunched around the Asura Hell Array. Zane figured someone strong was giving it a go. \par
Then Emeka Eze strolled out. \par
Emeka Eze\par
Signature Title: Touch of Death\par
Essence Level 118\par
Wasn’t he at 110 just a few days ago? \par
He gave the leaderboard a sidelong glance. It updated: \par
CAIN HASTINGS, 552 KILLS\par
 YUKI URABE, 703 KILLS\par
 EMEKA EZE, 862 KILLS\par
The crowd erupted. \par
862 wasn’t far from a perfect score—900! And he’d been in the mid-700s a few days ago… he was still growing very fast. \par
They locked eyes. \par
Eze gave him a look. Just a look, and a subtle smile. But Zane got the message. The man strode off without a word, calmly and proudly. \par
Zane smiled. \par
862, huh? \par
Okay. \par
He cracked his knuckles. \par
Time to see just what his new powers could do.\par


\section{130. Smash (I) }
\par
"Are you gonna give it a try?" said Evan.\par
Zane nodded.\par
"Good luck!" cried Evan. "You can do it!"\par
Evan said it almost every time Zane went into battle—from some others Zane would've thought they were just saying things. But Evan really meant it every time. He was rooting for Zane with his whole heart.\par
"Thanks," said Zane, ruffling his hair. Evan beamed.\par
Then Zane made for the Array portal. The crowd parted gasping before him.\par
It was the same technician running the Array as last time. A lady with a blonde bob; she was looking up at him with a little smile, but she felt quite nervous. Which tended to be a lot of peoples' default reactions to him nowadays. They got this intimidating aura from him somehow. He wasn't sure why; he thought he was pretty relaxed most of the time.\par
"Would you like me to set a time limit again, sir?" she asked.\par
"No," said Zane. "I will go all the way."\par
She nodded quickly. "Ah—of course! Whenever you're ready, sir."\par
She gestured to the portal; its spectral purple hues began to swirl, brighten, making a soup of psychedelic colors.\par
Zane took a deep breath, closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he was warm. Ready, eager to get in some good scraps. To see just how strong his new Mythic+ Smash was. And there was that number in the back of his mind, getting him all riled up—862 kills…\par
He stepped on through.\par
The world changed.\par
He stood in the first layer again. It was like the surface of Mars, a world of ruddy grounds, ruddier skies. Red dust storms scurried across the horizon.\par
Then the Monsters started spawning in. Giant rock-golems groaning, belching smoke, dripping magma from every joint.\par
He had a very simple strategy.\par
He just waited, let them spawn in wave after wave. Soon the whole army was bearing down on him, smashing at him with those flaming boulder fists; they exploded all over him; the fists ruptured, cracked, broke apart against his Steel skin. Those fires sputtered out against his own, stifled utterly. He barely felt the lot of them banging at him at once. CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\par
Soon all hundred of them were swarming him; he could hardly see the sky; he could hardly see anything. Just stone and magma exploding over his face, again and again, blotting out his vision…\par
They were hurting themselves a lot more than him.\par
In the meantime, he set up his new and improved Apocalypse Smash.\par
A furious redness spawned in the sky. He saw it through cracks of airspace in that tangle of flailing limbs; it looked like one of those dying stars. More red than white. The white was buzzing, flickering at the edges of it. Slashes of it streaked across the surface like bolts of lightning. But the rest, the bulky mass of it, was a smoldering furious red.\par
The energy there was stunning. The heat of it raged over him; that alone dwarfed the power these magma-fists put out. It made all the fires spurting up around him look like candle flames set against a noonday sun.\par
The sound surprised him too; it had this deep-throated crackling roar, huge and cavernous, drowning out the world. It had the same nice feel to Zane as revving a motorcycle. But louder.\par
First impression: Zane liked it quite a bit. It just felt like a good smasher. Zane had a good intuition for these things.\par
Time to test it.\par
He waited for the signal—there!\par
A shadow fell across him, fell across everything. The final boss spawned in, a looming skyscraper of living molten rock, bellowing so loud it trembled the dusky ground—\par
Pyroclast the Igneous King (Monster)\par
Essence Level 97\par
Zane let loose.\par
The red giant fell to earth. Right in the middle of the swarm.\par
BOOM!\par
It didn't feel like an attack. It felt like a natural disaster.\par
In an instant Fire Law was everywhere. A pure wall of it blotting out the magma, blotting out the stones, blotting out the sky. Raging through everything. It wasn't just Fire Law—it had a vicious Electric edge to it. It struck like lightning. It destroyed like the fiercest flame.\par
The blast knocked him off his feet, splattered him in a wall of soot.\par
He picked himself up, brushed himself off, spat the soot out of his mouth, and checked out the damage.\par
The landscape had been ruddy red. Now its whole face had been blackened—seared to slag going hundreds of feet in every direction. Mountains of ash ranged everywhere, smoking feverishly.\par
He seemed to be standing at the bottom of a massive smoking crater. It went so deep it touched bedrock.\par
There was just one dot left on his mini-map. Him.\par
Zane was quite satisfied. Yes—this was a good Smash. Last time it took him quite a few Extinction Smashes to get through the lot of these. And they certainly weren't instantly dusted like this…he quite liked the feeling of it.\par
He scratched his head.\par
Still. These things died a little too easily. It was hard to tell just how much stronger his new Smash was.This story has been stolen from Royal Road. If you read it on Amazon, please report it\par
He figured more testing was needed.\par
First Layer, Wrathful Inferno, has been cleared!\par
The Mars-world faded away. A new one faded in.\par
He stood on a black sand island, swaddled in an endless black sea. The sky was black too, the same color; you couldn't make out the horizon. The only source of light was the bright white moon. A monochrome world.\par
It was that squid world. He'd passed this one pretty easily last time too.\par
So he figured he could do the same thing. He threw his Apocalypse Smash up in the sky. Which brought a nice-looking blood-red sheen to the world, rippling across the waters, staining the sands. He started loading it, stuffing it with essence.\par
Soon it grew so hot he could see the surface of the sands starting to melt, run out into the water.\par
And he waited.\par
Ripples disturbed the waters. A massive tentacle reared out, snatched up a leg—but he turned up to Steely Density. It couldn't move him. Another got hold of his other leg. Then another. He waited for them all to spawn in; soon he was nice and trussed up. The nice thing was they yanked him from all directions, so he ended up staying in the same place.\par
He let them take their licks at them, gnaw at his arms, his legs with those little suction-cup spikes. By the time it got to eighty or so squids yanking at him, it actually started to hurt. Once they got near a hundred, he was mildly concerned they might dislocate a shoulder. That was a lot of Level 90-pluses, yanking on him as hard as they could…\par
Then that whirlpool popped up in the middle of the ocean. The boss spawned in at last.\par
Zane fed it an Apocalypse Smash.\par
BOOM!\par
His world erupted in steam.\par
It took a while for it to clear, swirl up to the skies in a little hurricane. He blinked.\par
He stood on a flat stretch of hard land. Glass, he realized. It was his island. That glass had been sand a moment ago.\par
It took him a moment to realize what was going on. He scanned his surroundings—there was a cylinder of air all around him, hundreds of feet long, hundreds of feet high, a football stadium's worth.\par
The gargantuan walls of this cylinder were a deep flickering red. Blasting fierce heat—all burning, roaring with it, laced through with Fire Law. Steaming up a storm.\par
And they were falling. Surging. Making a collapsing dome, sloshing all over him—\par
Oh.\par
He was looking at the sea.\par
He realized what was going on. His blast had just deleted a football stadium's worth of water. He'd put a giant hole right in the middle of the sea. And set the rest of it on fire.\par
The water had some thick Water and Ice Laws in it too. It was just that his Stormfire, augmented with Elemental Fire, didn't care; they had no power over this kind of fire. It smashed them aside and feasted.\par
Pretty neat. Zane approved. One quality of a good smash was how much it squished what it hit. If you squished something so hard it changed states of matter, that got bonus points.\par
Now burning walls of water bore down on him from all sides, tsunami waves hundreds of feet tall, cresting, spitting burning foam—\par
Second Layer, Lightless Depths, has been cleared!\par
And the scene shifted. Zane blinked.\par
He stood on a high barren plateau, riddled with dry cracks. The skies were stormy, slate-gray, heaving with rain.\par
He was learning some new things about his Smash. Still—not quite sure how strong it was. Everything it touched so far just got dusted.\par
Maybe this Layer would be a better measuring stick.\par
Wyverns were cresting the horizon, floating over. Nearly all Level 99. He waited until they were all swarming him, screeching, spitting wind and lightning—\par
He launched an Apocalypse Smash into their midst. It felt like setting off a nuke. A plume of red—then dust. Instantly. Smoldering dust, scattering in mini-tornadoes on the wind…he nodded. Still a good bird smasher, he was pleased to see.\par
Then came the Boss.\par
Gale Dragon (Monster)\par
Essence Level 103\par
The first actual Foundation threat. This thing had gotten him down to 75\% Health last time. It kind of looked like a scaly emerald-green bat blown up a thousandfold; it looked at him with narrowed slitted eyes, and snorted. Tiny stormclouds floated out of its nostrils.\par
It howled an ear-piercing battle cry. And started charging that weird tornado-breath Skill—\par
Zane whacked it.\par
BOOM!\par
It just came apart at the seams. Like one of those giant Lego sets dropped on the ground—every bit of it went every which way. He saw a burning scaly foot fly this way, blackened claws shoot up into the sky, what might have been a wing cratering to earth, a burnt-out husk of a head shooting out of sight, mouth still hung open in shock—\par
Third Layer, Windswept Woodlands, has been cleared!\par
Hmm.\par
Well—at least he knew Apocalypse Smash wasn't strong enough to instantly ash-ify a Foundation Level fighter. So that was something. Still… a little too easy. Though he did enjoy how it exploded everywhere like that.\par
He was still waiting to come up against a real challenge.\par
The scene shifted—a desert landscape. Cacti littered the dunes. A noonday sun baked high above…\par
And these massive Level 99 gold-plated beetles started rising out of the sands; their horns curved like scimitars. Their carapaces shimmered with heat. Their beady black eyes glared hatefully at him.\par
Scarab of the Sun God (Monster)\par
Essence Level 99\par
By now things under Level 100 almost didn't exist to Zane. He let them all pile on too.\par
Then wiped them with an Apocalypse Smash.\par
The blast changed the color of the desert. All yellow to all black.\par
He was interested to note there were a few Level 100s in there too. And they weren't ashes. Still, they were so badly roasted, so badly melted he could hardly tell they'd been Beetles; they looked like wax sculptures left out too long in the sun.\par
Then there came a deeper rumbling.\par
A yawning maw opened up in the sands right in front of him. And the boss rose out of the ground.\par
Scarab Monarch, the Desert Sovereign (Monster)\par
Essence Level 108\par
It was as big as a house; its shell ran two layers deep, one silver and one gold, scribed over with shining white runes. Its long limbs were started over with gemstones. Its eyes were like rubies, shining with a burning intensity; its massive wings unfurled, casting long shadows over the sands. As they began to buzz there came a sound like thunder.\par
Zane was intrigued.\par
Then it blasted him in the face.\par
It opened its mouth, and out came a gunky glut of blinding Light Laws—Light, laced through with Fire.\par
It came too fast to react to. It felt like he'd been punched; his skin was reddened, steaming, peeling off in places. He even staggered a step.\par
He wiped it off his face, frowning.\par
That actually kind of hurt.\par
The Scarab Monarch stopped rattling. It blinked its ruby eyes at him, like it was wondering why it barely did anything.\par
Then it opened its mouth, tried for another one—\par
Zane had enough.\par
BOOM!\par
When everything stopped shaking, he found its shell caved in. The middle of its body was flattened out utterly; organs spilled out its sides in thick stringy red sausage-tubes, along with quite a lot of black blood.\par
The ends of its body were still intact though. Zane supposed those two layers of armor did do something. It was still moving—ish. Writhing, spasming in massive pain, hissing loudly, spitting gobs of light-essence. Its whole body was burning, melting, swallowed up in Fire Law.\par
Still alive though. Kind of.\par
A second Smash squished it flat.\par
Skill up!\par
Apocalypse Smash I -> II\par
Layer Four, Sunscorched Expanse, has been cleared!\par
Zane was realizing there was a pretty stark difference between a Level 100+ like Zane or Eze, and a Level 100+ like this beetle.\par
At least this one gave him something of an idea of how strong new-and-improved Zane was. Strong enough to two-shot something of his Level. So—pretty darn strong, it seemed like.\par
He was quite happy with his new Smash so far. It was a good Smash; it pleased him greatly to smash things with it. It had a good boom and a good squish factor.\par
Still though. He hoped things would get more interesting soon. It was always so much more satisfying to smash hard-to-smash things.\par
The world changed. And he got his wish.\par


\section{131. Smash (II) }
\par
The desert faded out. A new world colored in all around him.\par
He stood in a strange swamp. A thick bog rose all around him, hugging him up to the knees. Massive trees towered all around; their trunks were bone white, their leaves a deep bruised purple. Thin shafts of moonlight flickered through the leaves. Vines coiled like pythons from the high branches. In the distance, there was a piercing mournful wailing.\par
He liked the atmosphere. Spooky.\par
Dark flickering shapes rose out of the bog. Most of their bodies were swaddled in tattered black cloaks that shifted and fluttered like shadows. The only part he could see were those grasping clawed hands; their skin was gnarled, wrung dry, white as parchment. Laws of Ice and Darkness streamed out of them, giving them little halos of coldness.\par
Bog Phantom\par
Essence Level 103\par
He was pleased to see even the minions now were Foundation. He had a good feeling about this Layer. He went into it relaxed, curious. But hopeful.\par
They flickered as they came for him, moaning softly. Four of them closing in from all sides, raising their gnarled hands, grasping out at him—\par
He felt a tug on his soul. A connection. Then a lurching, queasy feeling like some part of him was being sucked out. They seemed to be trying to wrench his soul out.\par
This might have been pretty annoying if not for the fact that he had quite a lot of soul.\par
The four of them clawed out at him, latched onto him; streams of ghostly light started pouring out of him, pouring into them. Not much, in the grand scheme—each of them clawed out maybe a percentage of Health a second. Still, though… he could see more popping up in the distance, drawing closer.\par
Alright. They'd had their fun.\par
One Apocalypse Smash, and he splattered them. They splattered into a weird white goo, quickly evaporating. Something between astral and physical. But it seemed he could still hit them—maybe it was his Major Law of Ethereal Flame at work. Soul or body, he was an equal opportunity Smasher.\par
There were many flavors of Smashing, but splattering was one of Zane's favorites. It gave him warm fuzzy feelings.\par
It seemed like all the trees in a fifty-foot radius got splattered too; they were all mowed down, charred to black husks. There had been some dense Wood and Dark Laws in those trees, but with Elemental Fire, his new Pseudo Stormfire was in a league of its own; he wasn't sure any Elemental Law could match it by itself.\par
The bog was now a wide sheet of coal under his feet, lightly smoking.\par
Then came the next Monster wave. He splattered them too without trouble. But they were getting to the point he couldn't round them all up and one-shot them all at once, which was encouraging.\par
And at last—the Boss.\par
It floated over the ashen mess, towering as big as the trees it floated out of. It looked like the Bog Phantoms, just blown up thrice as big. And eerie purple veins pulsed up its long thin hands. They ended in stark white claws.\par
Grendel's Wraith\par
Essence Level 113\par
Its hood pulled back, showing a gaping black maw sunk into a featureless white face. Zane blinked at it, fascinated.\par
Then it shrieked.\par
Zane felt like he'd gotten a bucket of ice water thrown in his face—he was stunned for a moment. The sound penetrated past his ears, struck his soul. It didn't hurt him much. But it did freeze him.\par
Then the thing blasted him. Hard.\par
So hard he was stunned again—it was like some giant ghostly hand had reached out and smacked him. It felt like he'd been smacked out of his body; the world swirled, spun around him, turned to a slurry of colors—he snapped back an instant later, feeling dizzy.\par
He shook his head to clear it. Then frowned, clenched his jaw.\par
It was time to get serious.\par
He focused Sage Mind on the thing and found it was feeling confused. It had slapped his soul raw—just gave him a good ol' whack, slapping right through Zane's soul defenses. But while Zane had felt stung, the Wraith felt like it'd hit a brick wall. Its own soul felt sore from hitting Zane that hard.\par
That was the thing about Zane's soul. He'd learned that one Demonic Soul defense skill a while back and then pretty much forgot about it. His time was better spent working on other things, like Smashing. Just being as big as he was was a pretty darn good soul defense, in his opinion.\par
And now it was Zane's turn.\par
He threw up an Apocalypse Smash.\par
But just as his red sun was falling the Wraith flitted out of the way. His Smash rattled the earth, shot up a wall of soot, made quite a big BOOM—but hit nothing.\par
And the thing whacked him from behind with that weird soul-slap. Zane groaned.\par
He turned, tried smashing it again—this time tried timing it, anticipating it. It still got out of the way. And smacked him so hard his vision swam. It came fast as a flicker, that soul-slap; he ducked and it still caught him in the face.\par
Zane frowned. He chased after it, still smashing, trying out different timings, trying to catch it just right; it somehow kept flitting, kept smacking him around for his trouble. Even feeling knowing where it was going wasn't quite enough; the thing had some stupid reaction time. Maybe because it was weightless moving was very easy. If he adjusted his Smash somehow it could still got out of the way.\par
All those smacks were adding up, too—his soul felt raw, bruised all over.If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%\par
All Zane managed to do was terraform the landscape. The whole place was a blackened, smoking cratered wasteland now. The Boss was still floating around though, being annoying.\par
Zane narrowed his eyes at it, head pounding awfully.\par
It was a big ghost bird, was what it was—a little too fast for his first anti-bird tactic. That was fine. Zane just thought of another one.\par
This time, Zane chucked an Apocalypse Smash just a little to its left. The thing went right—and tripped.\par
Gotcha!\par
Because Zane had laid out his other Chain in a long line, floating there, waiting. No Stormfire on it; no Laws on it at all. The ghost was used to reacting to his big flashy quick-moving thing.\par
So it ran straight into his still, essence-less trap.\par
The moment it did, he wrapped it. Started coiling around it over and over; it started wriggling, shrieking—maybe because of what it was made of, it felt extremely slippery, hard to hold on to. Zane had to keep wrapping it in more and more loops, keep crushing it tighter and tighter, just to hold it still—\par
Then he had another idea.\par
Didn't he used to have a skill for this? He hadn't used it in quite a while. And certainly not with Elemental Fire. But…\par
Promethean Noose!\par
And the whole thing caught Elemental Fire. Blazing deep-red flames, the deep-red of burning coals, lit every inch of Chain. And it started constricting like a cobra, digging deep into that ghostly black fabric, crushing its limbs together—\par
Skill evolved!\par
Promethean Noose (Rare -> Legendary) \par
Apparently just throwing Elemental Fire on it was enough.\par
The Wraith started roasting. It started shrieking, bucking even as Zane's noose tightened more and more, strangling it utterly, cutting off all hope—\par
And that wasn't even the worst part.\par
A redness washed over the world. High above, floating right over the trussed-up Boss, was an Apocalypse Smash. It hovered right over the moon, blotting it out. Replacing its silvery glow with a demonic glare. A glare quickly brightening, heating up…\par
The Wraith struggled harder, thrashed with all its might—but Zane held tight. The more it thrashed, the more it burned itself, the more it melted.\par
Then the Apocalypse Smash was complete.\par
He let it loose. The Wraith could do nothing but watch it drop, watch as redness swallowed up its whole world. It threw up some kind of glimmering Darkness-Law shield, a last resort—\par
Then the Smash crushed right through it.\par
BOOM!\par
There was a massive splattering.\par
Zane yanked out his meteor, reloading for another go at it—and saw the Boss was still alive, if barely. It was pretty badly melted by now. Mostly flattened; a lot smaller now. Chunks of its ectoplasm body was strewn all around it in puddles. Still struggling desperately—it just couldn't get out. This was pretty brutal, honestly. Strangled and scorched in one Chain, smashed with the other… Zane smiled.\par
BOOM!\par
By now, it had the barest flicker of life left. It tried going on the counterattack, tried whacking him, tried screaming, even—but he had a Chain around its throat, choking it off. He had five or six coils wrapping its arms to its torso, pinning it tight. It couldn't muster anything; it could only wiggle.\par
Watching birds struggle was tremendously amusing to Zane.\par
BOOM!\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 106 -> 107 \par
Skill up! \par
Promethean Noose II -> III \par
Layer Five, Duskmire Bog, has been cleared!\par
***\par
"The Savage Sage has cleared the fifth layer!" The technician announced.\par
Cheers went up. A few folks started chanting—"Savage Sage! Savage Sage!"\par
By now, the crowd had ballooned to hundreds of people; they were spilling out onto the streets. These past few days Silicon Coven mages had been examining the array even now, trying to figure out if they could tack on a projector—give the crowd a show.\par
His fanbase, just like his World Rank, was quickly burgeoning. Everyone wanted to see his rise. It seemed like every few days he jumped a tier of strength, found some new way to shock the world. Most of his fans were young guys who found him inspirational; though there were some older guys who liked how he presented himself, how he fought. Though there was a fair number of girls too. Reina was very annoyed to discover it mostly wasn't due to his combat strength.\par
There was much chattering going around, but most of it was folk feverishly discussing if he'd beat Eze's score. The crowd was very split on it. Money changed hands constantly as folk bet on it—at the moment, most folk thought Zane would do better than Yuki Urabe, World Rank \#6. But still slightly worse than Eze. Zane might have made a breakthrough, but Eze had too—and he'd learned a nasty new Skill, folk said, one that skyrocketed his powers. It was hard to bet against the king.\par
One boy was convinced otherwise. Evan Armstrong went around the crowd, happily telling anyone who would listen that Zane was definitely going to beat Eze's record. To him Zane was the very best.\par
Then—\par
“Please." A thin bald man snorted. His name was Tani, and he was one of the many attendants in Emeka Eze's retinue; he’d been given a spot because his father was childhood friends with Eze’s father. He had also just bet quite a large sum on Zane's losing. "That Zane Walker may have decent, if overrated, soul talent. But in Leveling? He's far inferior."\par
"Heh?" said Evan, blinking.\par
"He may be keeping pace with Lord Eze now," said Tani archly. He crossed his stick-thin arms, sneering. "But come the sixth, seventh, eighth layers? Then we'll see what separates second-rate posers from the true elites.”\par
He was gathering quite a few eyeballs; folk were looking at him all around. He noticed them and smiled, enjoying the attention. It made him want to keep spouting.\par
"That spar the other day was a mere fluke!" He snorted. "Everyone knows Zane Walker used a cheap trick. And even then, he could hardly match Lord Eze! In reality, he is merely an inferior talent. Soon enough he'll fall behind. Then we'll all forget this flash in the pan."\par
Evan frowned. "That's not true, Zane's not a flash in the pan! And he would never cheat!"\par
"Really?" Tani smirked. "Then tell me this! How is it one man beats the fastest Elemental Law comprehension in the world by a margin of five hours? Doesn't that seem strange to you? The gap between second and third is less than half that. How did he do it?"\par
"I—"\par
"The answer's simple!" Tani turned from Evan, looking to the crowd with smiling eyes. "We've all heard the rumor, haven't we? Cain Hastings accused him of it outright! Zane Walker came across a demonic inheritance. He's burned his lifespan! All for his fifteen minutes of fame—at what cost?"\par
Suddenly folk started frowning. Muttering.\par
Poor Evan was left there spluttering, reddening. "Zane wouldn't do that, that's not who he is!"\par
This did not do much to convince people.\par
"Everyone's saying it," said Tani. His smirk widened. "How else could he do it so fast? Isn't it obvious? Look all he's needed to do, just to match my Lord Eze! It's rather pathetic once you think about it."\par
Evan tried saying more, but Tani cut him off.\par
"Before you ask, he told me so himself! We met at the cookout the other day. He was blackout drunk and let slip that his greatest goal in life was to be known as the guy who matched Emeka Eze, even for just one moment! It's his words, not mine. Well. I suppose he got his wish…" Tani shrugged.\par
Evan was very confused by now—then he shook his head. He started reddening. "That's just not true!" he cried. "You don't know him like I do, he'd never say that! You—you take that back!"\par
Now a sly expression came over Tani's face. "Oh? Then how about this? If Walker beats Lord Eze's score, I'll take back everything I said. If he doesn't… you give me five high-grade Essence Stones." \par
"Deal!" cried Evan. To him it didn't matter what he bet. He knew Zane would never let him down.\par
Just then—\par
"What nonsense is this?" came a cold, calm voice.\par
Evan blinked. So did Tani. They turned—and found a man striding toward them. A man whose aura rose over him like a bonfire, suppressing every other aura there. A proud, regal man.\par
"Lord Eze!" said Tani. He smiled an oily smile. "It's so good to see you! I was merely putting this fool in his place. He claimed that poser Walker would somehow surpass you, you see—"\par
He choked off under the weight of Eze's gaze.\par
"Who gave you the audacity," said Eze slowly. "To speak on my behalf?"\par


\section{132. Squeeze (I)}
\par
"I came here," said Eze, "To check on Zane Walker's progress. Imagine what I find.”\par
His eyes flared. "My attendant. Making a fool of himself. While you are part of my retinue you represent our Faction. You represent me. What are you thinking?!”\par
"My Lord—" said Tani, cringing. But Eze wasn't done.\par
"Disgraceful," Eze spat. "And embarrassing."\par
Tani bowed lower, wincing heavier. "I—"\par
Eze spoke over him in a voice tight with cold calm anger. "I've allowed you to remain in my retinue in accordance with my Lord Father's wishes. You seem to believe this gives you some status. Some worth. Yet—what are you, in truth? A wastrel. You've never done a hard day's work in your life. You were handed everything you have, including your place here—and you have the nerve. To come out and run your mouth in public!"\par
It was the most anyone had heard Eze say in one go they were all shocked. Tani couldn't even defend himself then; his face sagged; he looked like he wanted to dissolve into the floor. "My lord!" he wailed. "I've failed you! I'm—"\par
"You are a nothing-creature," Eze continued, ruthless. "Zane Walker is a transcendent talent, one-of-a-kind. A hundred of you, a thousand of you, would not make up the worth of that man's little finger. You will treat Zane Walker with respect. Have I made myself clear?"\par
"Yes, my Lord!" cried Tani. "I've been foolish! Stupid! I'll—"\par
"Spare me your groveling." Eze snorted. "And this… ridiculous bet. Bullying a child? Have you no shame? That bet is hereby voided. Get out of my sight."\par
Tani bowed, and scraped, and ran away as fast as he could all at once. He almost tripped over himself trying to do it.\par
"Hmph."\par
Eze had been told he could be too cold at times, too cruel—he did not care. He would treat a man with respect if he deserved it. If Eze did not believe a man deserved respect, Eze would not treat him with respect. It was that simple to him.\par
In his eyes, the most respectable kind of man was he who had great talent, and worked to make the most of it. Then there were those who had no talent, and yet tried their very best. They did not interest Eze, but he could respect them.\par
Tani, however… he was a spineless worm of a man. He was the least respectable kind of man—the kind that made nothing of himself. It was doubly a sin since he was given every opportunity. Eze had no patience for failsons—family friend or not.\par
He turned back to the Array, and studied it in silence. "Hm."\par
Then— "I've made great strides in my Skills in the past few days," he mused. "I've mastered the first stage of the Deep Earth Hall's foundational Inheritance. And I've consumed two A-grade essence treasures, enough to boost me three Levels. Zane Walker may be a genius, but… I expect it'll be too much. The ninth layer is… nigh impossible. I don't expect he'll defeat me. He'll get there. The low 800s. And no further."\par
"Um," squeaked Evan. Who was still there, and still rooting hard for Zane. "I think you're wrong!"\par
Eze paused, blinked, looked down at Evan. He gave a little smile. "Then I’ll be pleasantly surprised."\par
***\par
Fifth Layer, Duskmire Bog, has been cleared!\par
Zane blinked. When he opened his eyes again, he stood in a glimmering world. Giant crystals poked up all around him, looping up the walls, studding the ceiling, covering every inch of space. The ground was flat, made of some kind of translucent mineral. Earth Laws hovered everywhere.\par
He seemed to be in some kind of crystal-studded tunnel. The place felt deep underground…\par
He heard a hissing. And red dots started popping up on the far end of his mini-map, drawing closer.\par
They looked like massive pythons made out of geodes, stuck together in a long uneven chain. All craggy and glowing.\par
Crystal Serpent (Monster) \par
Essence Level 105\par
Key Laws: Elemental Law of Earth\par
 Key Skills: \par
Crystalburst Spittle (Active) [Rare]: Launches a volley of crystal spittle at the enemy, akin to a devastating hailstorm laced with Earth Law. \par
Crystal Scales (Active) [Legendary]: The wielder's Earth-laced scales make it extremely resistant to concussive damage.\par
Deep Earth Bite (Active) [Legendary]: Bites down with deep earth pressure, exerting tremendous force.The narrative has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.\par
As they drew near, they opened their mouths, hissing. And he saw two giant spiked fangs jutting out. Big enough to snap a car in two.\par
He felt that Spittle attack coming.\par
This time Zane was ready for it. He'd gotten serious now; he'd been watching them with Sage Mind from the start.\par
But he struck first. Apocalypse Smash!\par
There wasn't much room to load it; it Smashed straight down the tunnel. And exploded. Crystal shards sprayed out the Serpents" mouths, heavy with Earth Law—they might as well have been raindrops for all the good they did. His Smash brushed them aside. And landed.\par
BOOM!\par
The explosion rocked the tunnel, Smashing through all that Earth Law, crushing crystals off the walls. Shards erupted down the tunnel, pinging off the ceiling. But the Serpents were still upright. Their faces were halfway blown off—but they were still crawling at him, hissing, glaring at him from their ruby-red eyes.\par
Another Smash took care of it.\par
Two Serpents slumped to the ground, shattered to lolling burning chunks. Solid work.\par
But more were coming. From the other side too—three of them, nasty and huge. Two more Smashes broke them to bits.\par
But that was just five of them.\par
More and more came at him—from either side now. He Smashed one way, Smashed the other, but they weren't stopping. The waves just kept coming—he was caught in the middle. It still took some time to load these Smashes. And in that time, they kept gaining ground. Their hisses sounded like steel plates grinding together.\par
The tunnel wobbled and shook, filling with smoke, with ash, with crystal-dust…\par
Soon they were getting a little too close.\par
Oh, boy.\par
It was looking like he was just going to have to eat this.\par
A Serpent lunged from one side, spitting shards. Another came from the other side.\par
Zane set himself on Stormfire. And then just started bashing as hard as he could.\par
Smashing everywhere, throwing fists, throwing Smashes, catching Serpents clean as they swarmed in on him. The tunnel started shaking as though caught in an earthquake; started expanding as bigger and bigger chunks of it were blasted off. Soon he was making himself a little cavern in the middle of the tunnel.\par
It wasn't enough to keep them all off him, though. A Serpent got a bite on his arm; he bit down and just took it. It felt immensely heavy as it sank into him; it had this pressure to it, this massive bite force—some Law there giving it an unnatural weight. The kind of pressure stones might feel deep underground… another clamped onto his leg. A third wrapped around his torso—one even tried gnawing at his neck.\par
Zane had to use pure brute strength to shuck them off; then he was raining fists all over them, beating them back, marking each punch with a brilliant bust of Stormfire—still new ones surged to take their place—there were just too many of them.\par
Alright, new idea. \par
He threw up an Apocalypse Smash. And hit himself with it.\par
BOOM!\par
The essence wouldn't hurt him; it was his own, after all—but the impact knocked him off his feet. He rammed hard into the tunnel walls, showering crystals everywhere.\par
The nice thing was—all the Serpents on him were dead. Most were melted to puddles. A few only had their lower halves left. One was dead but it still had fangs sunk into him, clamped tight—he had to pry it off. Its head went one way, its jaw the other.\par
That took care of the bulk of them. The rest he blasted to slag—with fists or Smashes. By the end of it, he was a sweaty wreck; his hair was wild, his shirt all torn up, exposing thick cords of bleeding muscle beneath. He wiped his face. He was panting heavily.\par
That was a mess. They’d almost got him down to 50\% Health…\par
Still. He had a good time of it; his blood ran hot in his veins. He was all fired up and grinning.\par
Hundreds of tiny fires crackled around him, burning on the crystal rubble. Arching up the sides of the tunnel.\par
Then a big red dot popped up on the edge of his mini-map. So big it almost covered the width of the tunnel. Then he felt a massive trembling; the outline of a head the size of a pickup truck, giant red eyes peered out of the dark—\par
Crystal Basilisk (Monster)\par
 Essence Level 117\par
Zane was done playing around though. The moment he caught sight of those eyes, he sent an Apocalypse Smash hurtling down the tunnel.\par
BOOM!\par
There was an earth-shaking explosion, a plume of smoke.\par
And the Basilisk hurtled right through it. Now it was mad, coming at him full speed. Zane just fed it another Smash.\par
BOOM! \par
The Monster screeched in fury; the sound raced down the tunnel, echoing over and over.\par
Then it came so close he could see it in the light of the flames. It looked like the guts of a mountain scraped out and stuck together; it was so craggy he could hardly tell its features apart. He'd caught it pretty good—half its face was flattened, burning with crackling deep-red fire.\par
But when it opened its mouth, he saw its fangs—which looked vicious enough to puncture the hull of a freighter—were still very much intact.\par
The Basilisk's body flared up with essence, coiling tight. And Zane felt what it was going to do. The trouble was there was nowhere to go, nowhere to dodge. No time to feed it a third Smash.\par
All he could do was throw up a Chain and brace for impact.\par
It lunged at him like a freight train, fangs bared, mouth unhinged—shockingly fast for its size; it just exploded into motion. It bit down with an incredible pressure—\par
And clamped down on Zane's Chain. CLANG!\par
He was wrenched back; he dug his heels in, gritted his teeth, rode out the impact. He must've skidded a few dozen feet before they came to a shuddering halt; earth fountained up all around him.\par
A huge chunk of its crystal fang had cracked off.\par
Then Zane noticed his Chain—its links had chipped at the edges too. Where the bite had struck.\par
He blinked at it.\par
Huh. He didn't even know Soul Weapons could break.\par
The beast screeched. Wind rushed past him, through him, howling, shrieking, blasting all his hair back, making him squint.\par
It was still biting down. Still struggling against him. And it was all he could do to hold the thing to a standstill—it was incredibly strong too, bearing down on him with all its bodyweight; he had to fight to keep it back, gritting his teeth, straining with his whole body—then it wrenched him sideways. Got him off his feet, off-balance—and bowled him through.\par
They tumbled over each other, rolling, rolling; it tried sinking its teeth into him, but it could only catch his Chains. It was getting tangled up in them—but it was coiling around him too as they spun, snatching him tight. Soon they were a tangled-up mess, coil over Chain over coil, on and on...\par
It glared at him, struggling to move. It didn't get very far. He frowned back, tried to pull himself out—but he was squeezed tight too, buried under layers of coiling crystal. He couldn't even get free enough to swing an Apocalypse Smash.\par
They seemed to be in a bit of a conundrum.\par
Then it hissed and started to squeeze. Squeeze with all its powers; the walls constricted all over him, massive coiled muscles bulging under the crystal—Zane wheezed. Then grunted.\par
His eyes flashed; his heart thumped hot in his chest. He snorted.\par
So it wanted to challenge him in a contest of brute strength.\par
This was not a game you played with Zane Walker.\par
He started squeezing right back.\par
Promethean Noose!\par


\section{133. Squeeze (II) }
\par
The strangle-off began.\par
The Basilisk’s coils wound over him. Its crystals shimmered, pouring out waves of essence; thick Earth Laws churned off them as the great beast squeezed tighter and tighter. Zane instantly felt it. He felt like a chunk of metal stuck deep in the bowels of the earth; some extraordinary weight pressed down on him, a suffocating, unrelenting pressure. Even with his Steel Body he was feeling the crush. His muscles began to burn.\par
But Zane's strangle was brutal in its own right. His was like a cattle brand, hugging tighter and tighter—the deeper it hugged, the worse it burned… the Basilisk felt lines of hot pain scalding all over it. It hissed.\par
Since he and the Basilisk were so tangled up, so looped around each other, in one big coiling ball, they felt double the pressure—when Zane squeezed he was strangling the Basilisk and himself underneath it. It was the same when the Basilisk tried squeezing him—squeezing over the same Chains winding up and down its body.\par
It was a hellish knot, and there was only one way it was unraveling. Both of them knew it. They gave it all they had.\par
Zane flexed hard, gritting his teeth, straining against the pressure. Trying to keep it off of him—it was no use. He tried throwing his arms and his legs up, making some wedges, but they were shoved farther and farther back… then he was flattened out. And all the pressure went straight into his body.\par
He groaned.\par
Almost at the same time, the Serpent hissed, spitting gemstones everywhere. It was hurting too. He saw its crystal scales chipping, breaking off, melting under the heat…\par
The question was—who would break first?\par
Right now they seemed about evenly matched. Zane might even be at a disadvantage since he started with a little less Health. They struggled like that for a few seconds; pain started shooting up his arms, down his belly. He could feel his organs start to compress, squish unpleasantly inside him; his whole Steel body started to fold, slowly, like a lawn chair. He let out a wheeze. This snake was like him, a power specialist; physically speaking he had no doubt it was one of the strongest creatures he’d ever fought. And it had the heaviest Element at its disposal too…\par
But then—\par
Savage Body Activated!\par
Health increased 25\%\par
Vitality increased 25\%\par
Strength increased 25\%\par
Zane grinned.\par
They’d been even before. But now…\par
25\% was a lot of Strength. 25\% was a lot of Vitality too. Sometimes in fights it was hard to tell precisely how much of a difference it made. But here it was immediately obvious.\par
They were deadlocked… and then they weren’t.\par
Zane fought. And felt the snake give way. Flexed everything he had; and suddenly it wasn't squeezing him anymore. Suddenly he was shoving the beast back. Squishing it between his Chains and his body. It thrashed, tried fighting with all it had—it wasn't enough.\par
Zane turned on the gas, straining mightily—his Chains crunched in, digging hard into those Crystal scales—\par
And the massive Basilisk shrieked.\par
CRACK!\par
The Monster began to tremble, head to tail. CRACK! CRACK! It was being crushed segment by segment; it tried wriggling out, tried making space, but it was far too late. CRACK! The pressure just kept mounting. His flames couldn’t quite catch on all that Earth Law, but it did a great job softening the Basilisk up. Making it so when Chains bore down on it, they started sinking through those crystal scales—\par
CRACK!\par
Whole chunks of it started to explode. It was just too much force for the poor beast to handle. Zane started grinning—hacking blood, but grinning.\par
Then came a CRACK! louder than all the rest.\par
And the Serpent went still. Its eyes went dull. Zane felt why—there was a giant spot of pain down the middle of its body. He’d just shattered its spine.\par
Then the whole thing exploded. Every crystal of it, erupting, blasted to nothing. And Zane knelt there gasping, smiling like a dummy.\par
His whole body sang with that pleasant soreness, the soreness of the exertion. His heart hammered in his chest; his whole body felt hot, overflowing with power, with energy. He felt good.\par
That was a good fight. He especially liked how physical it was. It made him work.\par
Just then—\par
Skill up!\par
Promethean Noose III -> IV\par
Skill up! \par
Fiery Renewal II -> III \par
Fiery Renewal raged even hotter, burning all him; he could feel it returning Health to him by the second. In just a few minutes he’d be fully healed, he figured.\par
The world dissolved.\par
A new world faded in.\par
This was how he imagined an ant saw a garden. Lots of very colorful, exotic-looking plants all around him—almost all of them were as big as him. Several much bigger. A few tree-trunk stems curved up to giant bulbs oozing sap. There were sunflowers with petals big as umbrellas. Tulips the size of trees.This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
He stood there waiting for the Monsters to come. He expected giant bugs or something. He’d never been scared of bugs. But as he looked around scratching his head, nothing happened.\par
…Where were the Monsters?\par
He started down a grassy lane, flanked on either side by giant flowers. He didn't make it five steps.\par
Suddenly red dots flashed up on either side of him. The flowers came alive.\par
He’d thought they were tulips at first. Then their heads unfurled, showing maws glistening with thorn-teeth and pollen.\par
Man-Eater Bloomling\par
Essence Level 110\par
Uhh—\par
They blasted him.\par
Before he even knew what was going on he was washed in a cloud of yellow spores.\par
He yawned.\par
He felt a little sleepy. He blinked. The flowers turned their massive heads to one another, as though baffled.\par
… He got the feeling that blast were supposed to do a little more. It was just… well…\par
Zane got out his Chains. And Smashed them.\par
BOOM!\par
This time there was no resistance—his Stormfire blazed so high they nearly touched the clouds. A dark silhouettes of giant flowers spasmed within; there was a high-pitched hissing. The silhouettes shrank, whittled away. Became nothing.\par
By the time the fires died down, Zane stood in a smoking crater. And all the Monsters were gone.\par
He blinked.\par
…That easy?\par
The ground started to tremble. Red dots popped up on his mini-map; new Man-Eaters cropped up all around him, bursting up through the ashes; their jaws unhinged—\par
He smashed them again. And again they hissed, and thrashed, and went up in smoke. One Smash wiped the bunch of them off the face of the earth.\par
Zane was surprised at first, but he supposed it made sense. There was a saying back in his fighting days—styles make fights. Grass against fire was just a very bad type matchup.\par
This Level was meant to be harder than the last, he was pretty sure. And maybe it was for most people. But for him, he just kept whacking. And they kept dying, struggling to get at him, struggling to throw their Skills—but nothing they chucked made it out of the flames. They went up in smoke. It was almost funny.\par
A few waves later…\par
THUMP.\par
Zane blinked.\par
THUMP.\par
It was coming from the end of the lane. A blotch of red on his mini-map. Zane turned, and saw it.\par
It looked like a dragon whose body had been taken over by one of those mind-control fungi. Its green body oozed sap. Two heads popped out of its heaving turgid body, and when it bared its teeth, it showed maws lined with razor-sharp thorns. Its droopy eyes stared listlessly.\par
Floragon, Flower Hydra (Monster)\par
Essence Level 120\par
It let out a cry that sounded like leaves rustling. Then it charged him, spewing a weird pollen-breath—\par
Zane Smashed it.\par
It wasn’t even the smash that did the most damage this time, but the aftermath. Stormfire was a voracious, destructive thing. And here it showed in full. The Boss tried throwing out its vines—Smashed. It tried a wooden shield. Crushed. It tried planting roots, regenerating its quickly dwindling health. But those roots burned up too.\par
It was incredible to the end that it could barely mount a defense. Sometimes you were just hard countered, Zane supposed. In that last layer, Earth had been a pretty bad matchup for him—not as bad as this one, though. This one was brutal. He nodded, satisfied.\par
In the end, it did get a couple of shots through—it spat some poison-tipped thorns at him. And Zane just ignored them and kept on smashing.\par
By now Wish Upon a Star was fully loaded. He had it in his back pocket. He didn’t even need it.\par
Skill up! \par
Apocalypse Smash II -> III \par
His Skills just kept shooting up in here. He was feeling that 4x Skill Leveling rate at work—it felt like every Layer at least two Skills got a Level.\par
Seventh Layer, Garden of the Gods, has been cleared!\par
***\par
The nice thing about that last floor was he got a little breather. His new Level III Fiery Renewal had done work. He was over eighty percent Health by the time he stepped through to the Eighth floor. He was still pretty ragged, but he was doing pretty solid.\par
He was getting close now. Just two more layers to go…\par
He blinked, looked around. Another bog layer. Just muddy and gunky—it went up almost to his waist. Just wading around was a hassle. He scanned around him—the mud flats just went on and on, a flat plane stretching into the horizon. There was no dry land as far as he could tell.\par
The air was heavy with moisture, the sky a sheet of dull gray. He saw swirling muddy whirlpools here and there, going down to who knew where. Pools of black tar were scattered about, bubbling softly.\par
Frowning, he tried a light Volt Blitz. Even then, he could barely move; Elemental Earth just swallowed his electricity whole. He frowned at it. Hmm.\par
Then Monsters started rising out of the mud.\par
They looked like just more mud, just molded into oozing shapes. Boulders and tree branches jutted out of them at random. They waded toward him, moaning, featureless—all they had was holes for eyes and holes for mouths. That, and a lot of Law. They were thick, sturdy mounds of Elemental Earth, all slicked over with Water Law.\par
Bog Demon (Monster)\par
Essence Level 114\par
Zane gave the nearest one a good ol’ Apocalypse Smash.\par
Its upper half was walloped off, splashing out. It stopped for all of a second. Then the eye-holes and mouth-holes re-emerged on the lower half, and the thing just kept coming for him. Stormfire crowned its head, trying to find purchase. It was melting the Demon, but slowly—it was having a hard time breaking through that Water-Earth combo.\par
Even the bog—which had been blasted wide open—was quickly filling back up…his Stormfire was sputtering. Water smothered Fire. Earth smothered both Fire and Electricity. Raw Elemental Fire would’ve gone out hard here, but his Stormfire made a fight of it. Still... not great.\par
Zane blinked.\par
He could feel his Smash had gotten a good deal stronger after that Skill-up. It was just—\par
Water and Earth.\par
It seemed like it was his turn to be type-countered. It spoke to just how much oomph Apocalypse Smash now had that it could still blast off half its body.\par
He scratched his head, watching the Demons draw near. Then—eh.\par
He couldn't do much about it now. It wasn’t like he had other offensive Elements. He’d make the best of what he had.\par
He chucked an Apocalypse Smash, then another. They did a good job splashing the mud about, making new smoking sinkholes, but it felt like more mud just took its place.\par
Three more Smashes took out the first squad of Bog Monsters. But more kept coming. The problem was the reload time. He decked a few with another Smash, swung around, and blasted another—\par
Then the things were on him. It was hard to get out of the way in all this muck; one of them sent up a wave of muddy water. He hardly threw it off before another came up behind him, slugging a monstrous fist. But he felt its soul, felt its intent, and rolled with it, turned with it. The fist grazed his cheek.\par
Then he socked the thing with a Stormfire Punch, and it went flying a good twenty feet. He turned, ducked a muddy haymaker, whacked the thing so hard it went tumbling, splashing over itself. Mud splashed up in waves.\par
He felt a third Bog Demon looming up behind. But he was too late to dodge. He just braced, turned, and took it as best he could. And grunted.\par
The fist dug hard into his gut. Hard enough to drive the wind out of him, hard enough to rattle his insides, pouring force through the deepest parts of him. That damned Earth Law.\par
Zane’s counter sent the thing rolling.\par
His punches did a lot less than his Smashes. Even now, the Monsters were regrouping, shambling at him again. More were joining them. Twenty, thirty, more, all shambling at him…\par
He could use Wish Upon a Star here. But he was hoping to save it for the last Layer, the one Eze died on. That one could be trouble. He had to ration his powers and Health here, make it out without taking too much damage.\par
Change of strategy—again.\par
Time to dust off another old trick.\par
He raised his hands.\par
And his meteor hammers switched to giant axe-heads, blazing Stormfire.\par


\section{134. Final Layer (I)}
\par
The neat thing about Stormfire Cyclone was he'd already upgraded it. So he just had to throw in his new Stormfire and—\par
Skill evolved!\par
Stormfire Cyclone [Legendary] -> Stormfire Cyclone [Mythic]\par
And his Axes began to spin, cleaving the air apart, leaving bright sizzling trails behind them—he heard that telltale shriek and smiled. He'd missed this. As they went, they grew brighter and brighter—\par
One.\par
Then—CLANG!\par
An Axe ran straight into a Bog Demon. And blew out its head. Only it also got stuck; the Demon wobbled around. Still living.\par
Zane frowned.\par
They were starting to swarm him now. The problem was he had to get this thing off the ground. It wouldn't be stronger than his Smashes or even his fists until it got going.\par
So he yanked out his Axes and tried again.\par
But this time, they rose high above, clearing the heads of the Demons. One.\par
The problem was if his Chains were up there, there was nothing protecting him. He knew it, too—he just bit down, hunkered in. And let them at him.\par
Five or six of them swarmed in…\par
Two.\par
Then they started walloping him.\par
A fist rammed him in the back, then another; he lurched forward—just as an Earthy smash clocked him upside the head. He staggered for a second, head spinning, but kept his feet. It felt like a little earthquake was going off down his back—inside his skull; pain spiked in his head; he couldn't stop his teeth chattering.\par
Warning!\par
Health under 75\%\par
He gritted his teeth. Three!\par
And now the air was heating up, taking on a red tinge, starting to warble. A crackling started up, a roaring, growing louder by the second; flecks of red-yellow started dancing on the breeze—\par
Now there were eight or nine of them on him, potshotting. He jerked back and forth, staggering—THUNK! THUNK!\par
It sounded like they were hitting a heavy bag, driving those sloppy hammer-fists deep into him. The pressure was seeping in—his Steel body did a good job of fighting it off but he still felt something rupture inside him. His face didn't bruise much anymore—but it was starting to dent. A well-placed punch broke his nose; blood spurted everywhere.\par
But he just took it with a grin.\par
If they wanted to put him down, they'd need to do a lot better than that.\par
In the meantime…\par
Four.\par
But the winds were getting fierce now—so fierce they were yanking the mud off the demons' bodies; their hole eyes twisted about, dragged by the currents. More Demons were rising in the distance, stumbling closer—but his Stormfire raged so fiercely now he could hardly see them. It was just a wall of furious red-white, and he was caught square in the middle of it. Along with a glut of Bog Demons.\par
Five.\par
A few Demons tried breaking in from the edges—his Axes went right through them. Their hole-eyes open in shock; their heads ripped straight off their bodies, whipping into the winds, baking in Fire. The pressure was getting intense, dragging everything upward—\par
THUNK!\par
A fist cracked him in the belly. Right in a spot he'd been cracked before, and it gave. He hunched a bit, spat out a mouthful of blood. But it didn't matter. His bloody grin widened.\par
Six.\par
The muddy ooze beneath them was starting to tremble. The pressure had grown so huge it was swirling, changing direction, following the searing winds. And now the Cyclone was too great to ignore.\par
Whole chunks of bog demon were getting ripped away, lost in the Cyclone. They looked up, befuddled, mouths hanging open—\par
Then they were yanked straight in. One by one. Ripped clean off the ground like trees in a tornado, flailing, dripping mud as they went.\par
Seven.\par
By now, all the Bog Demons had been thrown off him. They were fed into that meat grinder, that furnace—and the power there had grown astonishing. It was so huge Zane was starting to feel the drain, and he never felt essence drain except for Wish Upon a Star.\par
He watched as they flailed, mouths open in silent screams, trying to bash their way out—he watched their flails slow as they hardened, their eye-holes, mouth-holes freeze still as they went round and round. They were being baked alive. Cooked. Cracked. And then there were just more ash, roasted in a brilliant flickering flame.Unauthorized use: this story is on Amazon without permission from the author. Report any sightings.\par
The Earth was baked. The water, gone to mist. It turned out if you just turned the heat up hot enough, there was no such thing as a bad type matchup. Zane nodded, licking his lips.\par
It was pretty much his worldview in a nutshell.\par
Eight.\par
Now it wasn't even a contest. The bog demons could hardly resist anymore; they just got sucked in, baked, crushed, shredded—scattered to ash on the winds. They made a lovely cracking sound as they went; Zane soaked it in. There was something cathartic to it, like smashing clay. Then—\par
Skill up!\par
Stormfire Cyclone II -> III\par
Huh. They weren't even at the boss yet. He supposed it was the Array at work.\par
And now the Cyclone was reaching heights he'd never seen. The power in all that essence was climbing past even Wish Upon a Star.\par
Nine, and it was changing the world. The mud flats were swirling all around it, getting sucked up and blown out, helpless. It was even sucking in those slate clouds, breaking out chunks of blue sky. It was sucking in everything; it was storm fire at its destructive best. The pace and speed of lightning, and the destructive power of Fire. Put together in one devastating combo.\par
He was straining just to keep it together. His arms were starting to burn; his whole body was. He had to keep the thing turning, keep it all on a leash, keep that massive glut of power burning on and on—he was breathing heavy, grunting and hissing; his arms, his chest, his back flexed with all their considerable might; veins stood out purple all over him.\par
It was just barely enough.\par
Then he saw the Boss coming through. A muddy mountain rising to meet him, a few dozen gaping holes for eyes and one giant mouth. Boulders and trees stuck out of it at random angles. It shambled closer and closer…\par
King Gogoloth, Swamp Demon (Monster)\par
Essence Level 123\par
Ten.\par
Zane let out a groan. He couldn't help it. It felt like his whole body was tearing just keeping this thing running. He couldn't hold it much longer. Either his essence pool would give out or he would—he could hardly find a cloud in the sky anymore; the grounds were barren, roasted to ash as far as the eye could see, and now the ash was getting dragged up again, adding black streaks to his white-red apocalypse.\par
The Swamp Demon had been shambling toward him. Then it took one look at what it was running into. Its whole front side was reddened just standing near it. Its giant mouth fell open.\par
Then it turned around.\par
And started shambling away as fast as it could.\par
“…”\par
But it couldn't get away long. It was like nearing a black hole—the Demon had gone past the point of no return; the winds had picked it up, and it was being dragged in slowly at first, then all at once—\par
Eleven.\par
Zane heaved; he was tearing up. Fiery Renewal raged all over him, trying to heal the muscle fibers as fast as they could even as blood exploded out of his chest. He couldn't take much more of this—\par
He didn't have to.\par
The first Axe was a supernova, streaking over, boiling with essence, so bright it hurt to look at—and CLANG'd into the Boss's giant head. It slowed as it went through, noticeably dimmed—but it got the job done.\par
The Swamp Demon's head went flying, torn straight off its body—straight into the Cyclone.\par
Then his second Axe cut its body in two. And did the exact same thing.\par
When they swung back around, they were at around fifth revolution power. But they'd got the job done.\par
The Swamp Demon was all blazing stumps now. Stupidly hot Stormfire raged up and down the cuts, spreading down its body, undeniable. Roasting every chunk of it whole. The head and the body and the leg-stump all popped up with their own little eyes, their own little mouths—like how if you cut an earthworm a certain way, you could make two earthworms. It might've been a nasty surprise in another situation. But here it was too little too late.\par
Skill up!\par
Stormfire Cyclone III -> IV\par
Eighth Layer, Sinkhole Swamp, has been cleared!\par
And Zane sagged panting, smiling, to his knees.\par
***\par
The operator called out—"The Savage Sage has entered the Ninth Layer!"\par
A hearty cheer went up. The loudest of them came from a boy in the front row. Evan was bouncing-off-the-walls happy.\par
Eze stood there silently. Staring intently at the leaderboard. Off to the side, a few technicians were installing a projector to tap into the Array's live feed. They might make it in time for Zane's final layer.\par
The atmosphere was tense, yet bubbling with excitement.\par
There were a few spies from various big International Factions relaying the news as it happened. But there was a news organization too.\par
WRN, the World Ranker Network, a newly minted Faction made specifically to follow the Top Rankers—each of which had big fanbases all around the world. Fanbases that would shell out to know how their favorite fighters were doing.\par
By now, Eze was a known name—he had tons of fans at VGI and around the world. Zane's fanbase had shot up just like his cultivation these past few weeks; by some counts he had even more fans now. People just loved to see him fight—they could feel his passion, his joy. It felt like every time he showed up there’d be a surprise.\par
WRN was the only licensed provider of the recordings of Zane and Eze's fight. Recordings they'd gotten at huge cost from Elias and the Silicon Coven, but it was worth it. In just days they'd sold hundreds of thousands of copies—far beyond their wildest expectations. Only C-rank Beacons and above could play essence recordings and livestreams; all around the world whole Factions were huddling around their Beacons to watch.\par
Now they had a crew on-site covering Zane's race for the top spot.\par
"This is it, folks! The moment you've all been waiting for!" said Tyler Saunders, a blond, blandly handsome man with perfectly coiffed hair. He grinned at the recording crystal. "Will Zane Walker beat the magic number—862? Or will the Touch of Death continue his reign of dominance? The betting line's nearly dead even. On paper, it's anyone's game!"\par
At his side a beautiful brunette lady in a red dress, Becca Dwyer, gave a bright smile too. "But don't forget, the Savage Sage has pulled ahead in clear times! Our sources say he has nearly twenty minutes on Eze going into the final layer."\par
"Well," chuckled Tyler, who'd become a big Eze fan after seeing a recording of him one-shotting a B-rank dungeon boss. "Time isn't everything, Becca. We all know what Walker can do when it comes to blasting power—he could be the best in the world in that! But he'll need a lot more than that to beat Eze. My money's on the Touch of Death."\par
"I don't know," said Becca, who was a big Zane fan—her fandom started after seeing a recording of him all sweaty after a fight, but she'd since come to appreciate the non-eye-candy parts of him too. She pursed her lips. "We've never seen growth like Zane's before! Maybe he'll surprise us."\par
"Maybe. Still—our sources tell us the final floor's Fire- and Dark- themed. Which Eze matches up far better against," said Tyler. "That and his strategic mind could win the day."\par
"But Zane's got ideas of his own!” Becca pointed out. "He might come across them in unorthodox ways, but it's a mistake to think he's just a mindless barbarian. Our team reviewed all the footage on him we could find, and one thing's for sure—when it comes to intuition, he's second to none. I wouldn't count him out!"\par
"Looks like it's shaping up to be a hell of a battle," chuckled Tyler. “All week the Coven’s mages have been hard at work setting up projectors. Looks like they’re finally coming online now! We're about to get our first look—stay tuned, everyone!"\par


\section{135. Final Layer (II)}
\par
Ninth layer.\par
Zane stood on a cobblestone bridge large enough for an army to march down. It ran straight out, ending at a castle marked out black against a swirling purple sky.\par
It was a night with no moon. The only light came from below, a deep somber red. He glanced down.\par
The drawbridge was dozens of feet up. It went over a moat of lava. The Law there were fascinating—some mixture of Elemental Fire and Elemental Earth, but that wasn't all. There were mysteries there... something profound, something he couldn't begin to understand. \par
He blinked. He got the feeling he was looking at true Lava then. It made all the others seem like pale imitations. It gurgled and swirled softly, pouring out reams of light, of heat. He could feel it blasting him, fluttering his hair. Even from all the way down there. \par
These Laws ran deep—a good deal deeper than Elemental. They felt to Zane like Stormfire.\par
If he fell in there, he knew it'd be bad news. Even for him.\par
Just then—at the very far end of the drawbridge, the great steel portcullis raised up. \par
And Monsters marched out of the castle. They came one by one in tight formation. \par
Each of them was ten feet tall, clad in huge clink-clanking suits of dense black armor. They wielded swords and maces and spears, all black-red, and the ones at the front hefted bulky shields. Each of them looked like they weighed several tons. \par
They came at him as one. Each step made a boom, rattling the drawbridge.\par
Blackflame Knight (Monster) \par
Essence Level 116\par
They didn't seem like dumb brutes. When their shields came together, the Skills blended, making one giant smoking wall, drawing closer and closer…\par
What was that element burning through them? A strange black flame. It felt kind of like Stormfire—only a little weaker. Some blend of Fire and Darkness. As smothering as the night, as hateful as a dying hearth. \par
Zane frowned. Then chucked up an Apocalypse Smash.\par
It rammed straight into their shield formation. The fires flared; a dozen Skills spiked up at once. For a second, Zane's white flame raged against a dozen black ones.\par
The shields rattled, staggered back a step, smoking slightly, dented—but they held.\par
At the same time, he looped his other one round the back. But a wall of shields thrust up there too, and he barely moved them.\par
Hmm.\par
Then he saw a second wave of knights pouring out of the castle, bristling with spears…\par
They just kept marching at him; he was forced to take a few steps back. Still frowning. How best to deal with these things?\par
*** \par
"Here it comes!" said Tyler. \par
"For all our Zane fans out there, this is it! It's now or never," said Becca. She shuffled foot to foot, a little antsy.\par
Outside, the projector finally went live. And the crowd was treated to an astonishing sight.\par
Zane Walker was being forced back step by step. Waves of Knights pouring onto the bridge. They put up an ironclad defense. And Zane gritting his teeth, struggling—he tried smashing up front, but the force went through lot of them and dissipated. He tried switching to the axes, starting to spin—a forest of spears flashed up and shot him down instantly.\par
"Gotta say, not looking good for the Savage Sage,” said Tyler, tutting. "His main weapon's being shut down pretty badly. And he can't get that Cyclone Skill of his going either…"\par
"Maybe he's got something up the sleeve," said Becca, biting her lip. "Don't forget, the fight's just beginning!"\par
"Or just ending, it looks like," said Tyler.\par
Because not thirty feet behind Zane lay the end. A sheer cliff dropping straight into the lava… there was nowhere to go. He was getting overwhelmed.\par
Just then he tried leaping in with a smash. And got thrown back so hard he nearly went overboard. He anchored himself with a hammer and landed on a knee, panting hard. \par
The crowd gasped. So did Becca. \par
"C'mon, Zane!" she cried, glued to the projection. For a second it was like she forgot she was supposed to be commentating. "You've got this!"\par
Up in Seattle, Reina was clutching a pillow tightly as she watched the broadcast. Usually when she was this nervous she clutched Zane, but Zane was busy at the moment so the pillow would have to do. She frowned at Becca just then, suspicious. Some sixth sense of hers was tingling. I know why I'm nervous. Why's she so nervous?\par
By then, the whole bridge had filled up with Knights, an army of them stacked side by side. There was no escape—\par
But at the edge of the bridge, Zane was smiling.\par
"What's he doing?" said Tyler. "He's stopped fighting…I guess he's given up? Well.” Stolen novel; please report.\par
He chuckled. “With how things are going, I don't blame him! A solid run, Becca, but like I said—" \par
Then he choked.\par
Because right above the bridge, a star bloomed in the sky. A star that shone so bright it painted the soldiers white. They looked up, baffled. So did the crowd.\par
Then it seemed to hit them all at once. Suddenly, Zane's smile made sense.\par
"Oh my god!" said Becca. "It was a trap!"\par
The star made landfall right in the middle of the bridge.\par
And the dozen-odd Knights caught right under it had their heads crushed in.\par
Another few dozen were thrown flailing, falling down, down—splashing into the lava. It swallowed them whole; little bright spurts came up in their wake like the lava was licking its lips. \par
Suddenly the bridge wasn't an orderly march of Knights anymore. It was a bunch of ragged lines, poked through with holes, with missing members. The formations were broken…\par
Tyler's jaw hung slack. "Holy shit."\par
"Ha!" laughed Becca, breathless and grinning. "In your face!"\par
Then, at the same time, they seemed to remember there was supposed to be commentating.\par
Becca cleared her throat—\par
"A—a magnificent trap from the Savage Sage, and now he's back on his feet!" \par
And the big man at the end of the bridge had indeed stood up. Huge rivers of essence streamed into him from below. There was a flash—\par
"And he's Leveled up too!" gasped Becca. "He's in perfect position to counter!"\par
The big man got to work.\par
His Chains looped back around, smashed through the front lines, and this time they couldn't hold him off. Partly because he smashed from the sides now, sending them staggering toward the edges—\par
"He's not even trying to crush them, he's trying to throw them off the sides! He knows that's all he needs!" Becca cried. \par
And as Zane barreled forward, the lines just melted before him. He crashed right through, bowling them aside—\par
"They can't stop him!" choked Tyler into his listening crystal. He looked frazzled, spaced-out; all his smugness was gone. "He's going for all of them. He's a goddamn maniac!" \par
One blazing rush of Stormfire ran straight up the bridge, sending black flames splashing out to either side; Zane only seemed to gain power, gain momentum as he ran—he bowled his way all the way to the end. They tried stopping him, tried clubbing and slashing him, but he seemed to have some kind of instinctual sense for where they'd be—\par
"He's using Sage Mind!" said Becca. "The same Skill he used against Eze—it lets him put those Smashes exactly where he needs to throw them off!"\par
Zane still got minced. You couldn't run through an army and not get hit, even with perfect defense; by the end of it his face was bloodied, lips split, and cuts laced up his arms. \par
He was also running out of steam by the time he made it to the end. But he still managed to smash his way through the last few stragglers; he ended up picking up the last Knight and flinging it straight into the lava.\par
And then there was just one man left standing on the bridge. \par
Then, breathing heavily, he beat a fist to his big chest. And grinned.\par
The crowd exploded in cheers.\par
"Incredible!" gasped Becca.\par
"Fuck," whispered Tyler.\par
"How many fighters was that!?"\par
"Forty? Fifty, even?"\par
"He must be getting close to Eze's record—and he's Leveled up too! I don't know about you, Tyler, but I'm feeling pretty good about his odds!" \par
Another troop of Knights poured out of the castle, but Zane had their number now. And his Smashes seemed stronger now, sharper—maybe from all the Level-ups. Each Smash staggered them more. And he came at them from the flank now, trying to break them up, unsettle them before he bowled up the middle and knocked them off the side.\par
He was executing now with brutal, beautiful efficiency. Turning back line after line…\par
Becca narrated it all with enthusiasm. Tyler was just sputtering exclamations of shock. \par
Then a shadow loomed from the mouth of the castle. A shadow far bigger than all the rest.\par
"It can't be…" gasped Tyler. "That couldn't have been a hundred kills!"\par
“It wasn’t,” Becca confirmed. “Then—then how…?” \par
But there the creature stood, 20-odd feet tall, clad in smoking bedrock armor. Two red flames for eyes burned in a heavy-duty helm. In its hands, it held a sword and shield.\par
Blackflame Champion (Monster) \par
Essence Level 130\par
"Could it be a mini-boss?" said Becca, eyes wide.\par
"It's got over twenty Levels on him!" croaked Tyler. "That shield's the size of a freaking barn! How's he even supposed to hit it?!" \par
Zane frowned. But he didn't seem intimidated; he instantly went to work. He thrust out his Smashes, tried knocking it over—blocked. He earned two good dents on the shield, nothing more. He tried setting a tripwire for the thing—blocked. He tried looping around the sides, the back—blocked again and again. The shield was so big it hardly needed to move.\par
Soon it was scarred all over with craters. But it got the job done.\par
"See that essence glow? That’s a defensive Skill!” said Tyler. "As long as its shield's in front it can block anything coming at it." \par
"Zane's on the backfoot again," said Becca urgently. "Can he find another miracle?" \par
This Champion was strong too. Zane stepped back, parrying sword slashes, trying to find his way around that shield… \par
The only time it opened up was when a block knocked Zane all the way off-balance and it saw a chance for a killer blow. Then it lunged—and tried to skewer Zane through; Zane had to pivot hard to avoid being gored.\par
An assistant ran up to Tyler, whispered something in his ear, and he nodded. "I'm hearing we're just around sixty kills now. Which means this is about where Eze died too…” \par
"I don't know about you, Tyler, but after that last showing," said Becca fervently. "I'm not writing him off 'till it's over!"\par
But that last showing depended on having a supernova to bail him out. And as he got closer and closer to the edge, all he managed was to raise a few more dents on the thing's shield…\par
Then Zane sighed like he didn't want to have to do this. And that same fiery grin came over his face again. \par
All their hearts skipped a beat. He shouldn't have anything, couldn't have anything, and yet—when the crowd watching at the Array, when the newscasters watched slack-jawed when the millions of folk tuning in from hundreds of thousands of Factions around the world saw Zane Walker charging the Champion, Chains flailing, they believed. Something about that man made them believe. \par
They watched him rise, throw everything he had against that shield. Make a dent so deep it caved in the face of the thing…\par
But not deep enough to break through. And he was flailing, thrown out of position.\par
Then he got blasted. The shield rammed him hard. For a good second he was airborne, helpless. \par
The Champion seized its chance. \par
The shield came down. The sword flashed up—and skewered Zane right through the midsection. \par
No-one could believe what they were seeing. \par
But then, in almost the exact same moment—two Apocalypse Smashes cratered into the Champion's head. They snuck in just as its shield was setting back in place. \par
The shield came out. The Monster reeled back. It went over sideways, off-balance, shield flailing, and fell.\par
A second later it crashed into the lava below. The splash went halfway to the bridge. \par
There knelt Zane Walker panting. Grinning. Coughing blood, huge gouts of blood, but grinning. There was a hole in him going through the middle, so wide, so deep you could see air on the other side. \par
Then he stood. Stared, chin held high, at the castle. They could all tell what he was thinking. \par
Bring it on.\par
Weird thing, though—something no-one noticed, not commentators, who were losing it, or the fans, who were going ballistic. \par
He could still stand—because that sword thrust, in the middle of all his flailing, had somehow slid a curious arc. Right between all his vital organs. \par
It wasn't an accident. \par

It was a good thing too. Zane was gushing pretty heavily; a waterfall of blood spilled out his midsection. But now he was healing so fast he could feel his skin, his muscles stitching together. There was a little bonfire in his gut. Cauterizing, clotting, mending…\par
The higher Level a Skill got, the more essence it took. But there was a bigger jump in power too. And the stronger stuff he killed, the more Skill Levels he got.\par
It was hard to equate between rarity tiers. But if Zane had to ballpark it, a Level V Skill of one tier was about equal to a Level I Skill the next tier up.\par
Level V was when skills got really powerful—when the System gave them that 'high Level' exclamation mark. And now both Apocalypse Smash and Fiery Renewal were pretty darn close.\par
It showed. In just seconds, most of the bleeding had stopped. He was still dripping pretty heavily, feeling woozy. But he was ready. He spat blood, turned his eyes to the castle…\par
He wondered how far he'd gotten. He had to have killed at least fifty by now, right?\par
Red dots popped up at the edge of his mini-map, clumped in tight formation. The next wave was coming.\par
They were Knights again. But bigger this time—ten or so, smaller than the giant one that'd just skewered him, but a good head bigger than all the ones that'd come before.\par
Dread Knight (Monster)\par
Essence Level 122\par
It looked like from here on out they'd only get stronger and stronger…\par
Zane clenched his fists, breathed out. And rose to meet the challenge.\par
***\par
The crowds bunched around Beacons all over the world, the crowds bunched around the Hell Array, the thousands huddled around little scrying-glass receivers, watching with bated breath—everyone was still reeling when the next wave came through.\par
These new Knights wore spiked helms. And their shields were edged molten red with runes scribed in the middle that glowed, as though written in lava. Their weapons were fiercer too—burning with a deeper kind of darker. A darker, hotter kind that warped the air around it…\par
"It’s not over yet! This wave’s a lot stronger than the last!” said Tyler.\par
As they came at Zane, they made a giant shield-wall. Looming high, burning dark and cruelly hot, marching ceaselessly forward; you couldn't find a single weakness in it. It made for a scary sight.\par
But there was no fear in Zane Walker's eyes, no panic. He was still breathing heavy, still pumped up, but his eyes were totally clear—just taking it all in…\par
He hurled himself straight into their midst.\par
Two Apocalypse Smashes raged in from the sides, staggering the lot of them—the explosions shook the bridge, shook the Knights, blasting them off balance. Making their clean lines a jagged mess.\par
And Zane went berserk.\par
It was brutal. Efficient. Not graceful. His was a blunt way of fighting, a simple way—every punch, every Smash, landed with devastating force.\par
“Good grief,” whispered Tyler. "He's tearing right through them!"\par
"He has this way of making you fight his fight," said Becca. "He turns everything into a messy brawl! And no one brawls better than him—oh my god, look at that power!"\par
She cried that last bit as a Stormfire Punch lifted a Knight clean off its feet and tossed it over the edge.\par
They all watched transfixed as he went to work. The Knights got their licks in, carved out bloody chunks of him, but nothing they threw could stop him. Or even slow him.\par
“Fuck…” By now Tyler had gone hoarse. His hair was in disarray. “Zane Walker’s a goddamn force of nature!” \par
He’d been a firm Zane skeptic before; he’d been in the camp that thought the Eze fight was a fluke.\par
Zane was making him a believer.\par
By the end of it Zane stood heavy, bent over slightly. Hundreds of fresh cuts shone on his body. Some were so deep they went almost to the bone. He was gushing everywhere again; those white flames of his could hardly keep up.\par
His body was wrecked, beat fup, heaving. But his eyes were still the same. Still clear as ever, burning fiercely.Unauthorized duplication: this narrative has been taken without consent. Report sightings.\par
But it was like the Hell Array was determined not to give Zane any breathing room. Almost as soon as he'd cleared that wave...\par
THUD. THUD. THUD.\par
Two pairs of heavy footsteps rumbled from the castle.\par
Shadows loomed over the gates. And two massive creatures ducked out.\par
They looked like ogres in suits of armor; mountains of muscle bunched under boulder-rough gray skin. Their eyes shone bloodred. They growled, rumbling deeply, baring fangs like saber-tooth tigers.\par
And in their hands they held maces the sizes of lamp-posts. They were topped with wrecking balls burning with Blackflame. Their spikes seethed molten-red.\par
Blackflame Executioner (Monster)\par
Essence Level 132\par
“Level 132?! And there's two of them?!" choked Tyler.\par
In Seattle, Reina clutched her pillow so hard it nearly burst.\par
Then the Executioners swung.\par
Zane must've been using Sage Mind. Because if he'd been purely reacting, he would have been squashed then and there. Those maces streaked through the air—and smashed the bridge so hard it was like an earthquake struck; chunks of stone shook off the sides. Two new craters marred the ground, smoldering Blackflame.\par
Then Zane struck back.\par
He threw in two Apocalypse Smashes, one for each Monster—they tried blocking with their maces. But Zane must've been able to feel their trajectories. The meteor hammers made a clean loop over the top. And clocked them straight in the head.\par
It blackened the steel, drove big bumps into the helms. But…\par
"He's trying to knock them over," said Becca; she was flustered just watching it. "But one Smash just isn't enough!"\par
The maces rained down—and Zane leaped back again, giving more ground. The Executioners barreled after him, slobbering, filling the air with their smashes—they didn't give him a chance to strike back. When one of them smashed, the other was reloading. They might've looked like slobbering brutes but they moved in perfect sync.\par
"He's getting close to the edge again!" warned Tyler. Then—"Hell!"\par
He cried that last bit after a mace barely missed Zane's head.\par
Then Zane stared up, eyes bright.\par
He roared. And threw with all his might. Two Apocalypse Smashes blitzed through the air.\par
And cratered into the helm of the nearest Executioner. One after another.\par
The first Smash staggered it. The second Smash knocked it off balance, crushed the helm all the way in; it roared, went bowling over the edge…\par
But that was just one of the brutes. Zane had thrown everything he had at it—an all-out attack; it was the only way. He’d had to turn his back on the other.\par
A mace loomed over him—\par
He barely had time to turn back. There was no time to dodge. It slammed down on him, tons upon tons of burning black steel boiling over with essence…\par
And it crushed him.\par
The crowd gasped.\par
Up in Seattle, Reina screamed.\par
A silence.\par
The smoke was quickly clearing. The mace was planted deep into the ground… a pool of blood leaked out from under it, staining the sooty ground. Reina choked. She knew it wasn't real, but she could still hardly bear to look.\par
“Is—is that the end?” croaked Tyler.\par
Becca couldn’t even speak—both her hands covered her mouth.\par
Then the mace lifted. The ogre blinked.\par
Then the hole-ridden, mangled, crushed man underneath twitched. And build up to an elbow, then all fours—and staggered to his feet.\par
Zane Walker was riddled full of holes. Chunks of his big body were crushed beyond recognition. You could hardly make out a patch of skin that wasn't bloodied. And yet—though his nose was broken, and a leg looked pretty badly mangled—he wasn't totally ruined.\par
"How?!" said Tyler.\par
Becca gasped.\par
"Look—over his shoulder!" she cried. "It's the chain!"\par
A length of Chain was slung all over him. Over his head, snaking down his body covering his vital organs. It was chipped. Almost shattered in places. But where it protected, Zane was only smashed. Not destroyed.\par
"He planned that too?!" Tyler looked ready to yank out his hair.\par
“It’s—“ Becca was struggling to find her voice. “It’s like he’s always a step ahead!”\par
The Executioner looked furious. It ran at Zane, taking another swing—but this time Zane was fighting one-on-one.\par
This time it barely lasted a handful of exchanges.\par
One Smash blasted it behind its head, right at the base of its skull. Another crunched into the same spot and it was hurtling forward, sprawling off its feet. The Chains circled around, catching its legs, making a tripwire—just a little something extra to help it on its journey.\par
The Executioner went over the edge.\par
And once again, Zane was the man left standing.\par
Every single wave he looked more mangled, more ruined than before… except for his eyes. They stayed exactly same. They had this burning intensity, this focus...\par
“Zane Walker is on another level," croaked Tyler. "This is world-class right here, folks! World class!"\par
Zane staggered around as though drunk. His body was falling apart before their eyes. White flames worked furiously trying to keep him up—\par
Yet another of those ten Dread-Knight waves was coming past the gates.\par
Zane threw himself at them. No hesitation.\par
He smashed, staggered, bowled his way through, and by the end of it, he looked like he'd been through a meat grinder. He stood there shaking, utterly brutalized.\par
Tyler asked the question on everyone's mind—the question crowds were shouting in awe at Beacons around the world—"How the hell is he still standing?!"\par
But they could all see it in Zane's eyes.\par
It was a matter of sheer will.\par
Eze stood in the shade of the nearby trees, a little removed from the hectic crowd. And nodded, a little smile on his face.\par
The world was seeing, up-close, what he'd seen days before.\par
Another wave came at him. This time the Knights were still bigger—\par
Dread Paladin (Monster)\par
Essence Level 125\par
Over and over they came—it was enough to make a man lose hope.\par
You would've thought it was the very first wave with the way Zane threw himself at it.\par
This wave was particularly brutal. His wounds were taking a serious toll; even he couldn't ignore that. You could see he could feel things coming, tried preempting, reacting—but his body just wouldn't move the same anymore. He took some brutal, bone-shattering blows going through them. He got crushed again and again.\par
He threw off the last of the Paladins. And slumped facedown on the ground. Utterly broken.\par
A heartbeat. Two.\par
Just when a little doubt started creeping in, just when they thought this was the time the big man would stay down at last—\par
Zane built up to an elbow. Then to his knees. He staggered up. A wild aura came over him, a sharp burst of power; his aura exploded. Some unseen, last-ditch Skill was activating.\par
Zane Walker was heaving, bloodied. But his head was unbowed. By now they'd all lost count of the kills; it didn’t matter anymore.\par
"Oh my god…" whispered Becca. She couldn't seem to stop saying it.\par
He just kept finding the will to keep fighting. And that will was pushing his body far past its natural limits; he was the definition of Critical Health right now. And yet…\par
There he stood.\par
"This man has heart like you've never seen!" Tyler screamed joyfully. "If you want to stop him, you better make sure you've killed him! Because he just. Won't. Stay down!"\par
Up in Seattle, Reina was conflicted. She'd squeezed the pillow so hard it burst.\par
She was having a heart attack. But she was also incredibly proud; all she could think was, that's my man!\par
The crowd was all on their feet now, shouting like they were trying to give him energy through the projection—\par
"Savage Sage! Savage Sage!"\par
But he was swaying on his feet. You could only defy the odds for so long—he looked like he was a stiff breeze away from death.\par
Then the biggest shadow yet loomed out of the castle.\par


\section{137. Final Layer (IV) }
\par
The moment Zane saw the Monster, he frowned.\par
It had to bend to the waist just to get out of the castle. Its shadow stretched half the length of the bridge. It was made out of a steel plate blacker than black, swirling with silver dots. Like there was a night sky trapped in the metal. The plates melded together seamlessly. There wasn’t a chink in the armor. The whole thing smocked like a burning building.\par
A single glowing red eye lay in the middle of a giant block of a head.\par
Each step it took rattled the whole plane, sent debris jumping all over.\par
Dread Colossus (Monster)\par
Essence Level 142\par
“Oh… my… god…” whispered Tyler.\par
Zane still stood there frowning, puzzling at it. Like he was trying to feel out a weakness. The thing wandered out onto the bridge; it started lumbering at him…\par
Zane didn’t move.\par
“What’s he doing?!” said Becca. “He has to get out of there!”\par
“Maybe he just can’t,” croaked Tyler. “He’s at Critical Health, I mean—he can barely stay upright!”\par
It was over. They all knew it.\par
And yet... when you looked at Zane you didn’t get the impression of a broken, defeated man.\par
He didn’t even consider giving up on himself.\par
His eyes were watching, seeing it all coming. Seeing an arm as big as a skyscraper looming over him, seething Blackflame, smothering him in its shadow…\par
“His eyes!” cried Becca.\par
They were what’d drawn them all in this whole time. What gave them pause.\par
Zane Walker’s eyes were remarkably still. Like limpid pools of water. There was a dark intensity to them, a fierceness—yet they stayed startlingly clear. Even now, face-to-face with certain death—death literally falling on top of him, blotting out his world…\par
But they could see he didn’t have it. They couldn’t find that glow in it, that a-ha moment Zane kept pulling out time and time again.\par
“Do something!” cried Becca.\par
Zane stayed in the pocket. Staring down death, searching with that searing intensity…\par
Then the arm fell on him.\par
And at last, Zane moved.\par
His legs wouldn’t obey anymore. So he lashed a Chain behind him and yanked forcefully; his body hurtled away—\par
The fist crashed faster than any of them would’ve thought possible. It sent fissures streaking down the side of the bridge, showering stones—the whole structure shook with the force of it. A wall of blistering black fire shot so high it licked the clouds. The backlash, the explosion, would’ve thrown Zane off the bridge if it weren’t for his hammer anchoring him.\par
Becca gave a strangled gasp.\par
If he’d been just a moment late…\par
Everyone watching had their hearts in their throats; they clutched chairs or arms, white-knuckled. Up in Seattle Reina was ready to burst.\par
Everyone was nervous. Except, strangely, for Zane.\par
Zane just blinked at the death he’d narrowly avoided, taking it in. Then he looked to the Colossus.\par
He seemed to realize something; a light flashed in his eyes.\par
The Monster lumbered toward him and he nailed it with an Apocalypse Smash. A hunker of a thing now that it’d Leveled so high—yet against this thing it didn’t matter. He could barely dent it.\par
Then Zane wrapped his Chains around its legs, trying a tripwire—it walked right through it. Kicked the Chains aside like they weighed nothing.\par
“Thirty Levels… it’s just too much!” choked Tyler. “Zane can’t knock the thing off-balance, he can’t even move it! He can’t do anything to it—how’s he supposed to get it over the edge?!”\par
By now both he and Becca were barely commentating anymore. They were just fans now, shouting what everyone was thinking.\par
They watched as the Colossus slouched forward step by monstrous step; its joints creeped and groaned as it moved. Its fist went high—\par
Zane unleashed another Smash.\par
Not at the beast. Between its legs. It shot out, stuck the giant crater on the other side.\par
And Zane yanked.\par
He whipped through the gap and landed exactly where he’d been seconds ago. Behind the Colossus, facing its back.Stolen novel; please report.\par
But the Boss recovered incredibly quickly; its giant red eye narrowed; it swiveled and crushed in one smooth motion—\par
“No!” said Becca.\par
This time Zane barely got out of the way.\par
He landed in a heap a few yards down, heaving; the spot where he’d been just a second ago had caved all the way in. Deep fissures ripped through it like open wounds, bleeding gravel out of the rough stone.\par
This time when the Colossus stomped at Zane, it came out at him crouching low, giant arms outstretched, ready to scoop him up and crush him—sweeping across the bridge…\par
“It’s left him no way out!” shouted Tyler. “No room to run!”\par
Zane frowned at it too, like his imminent death was just another tricky puzzle.\par
He had just a fraction of a second to find an answer—\par
And he did.\par
He yanked himself hard. And went flying off the side of the bridge.\par
Becca screamed.\par
Then—as the Colossus turned to face him, red eye squinting, a Chain lashed around its pillar-leg.\par
He flew in a wide arc; for a good half-second all that lay under him was certain death—bubbling, boiling lava.\par
Then he landed on the other side—staggered, panting. But somehow standing.\par
“Holy—what the hell was that?!” said Tyler. “What a move!”\par
“How long can he keep it up?!” cried Becca. “He hasn’t even hurt the thing!”\par
It was true. Zane was back, somehow, in the very same crater he’d started out from. Back to square one. He’d been running this whole time, buying time any way he could—but he was quickly running out of tricks…\par
The Colossus, meanwhile, had learned its lessons.\par
When it came at Zane again, this time it moved with a finality, a sureness, a purpose. Like it’d had enough of this ant. And it knew exactly how to squash it. The Boss aimed a fist—and fired.\par
There was no big wind-up this time; this time hundreds of tons of burning steel jabbed out like a piston, lightning-fast. Zane barely had time to react. It was all he could do to thrust out a Chain—try yanking himself out of the way—\par
The punch landed so hard the whole bridge teetered.\par
For a second they all thought it’d crushed him.\par
Then the smoke began to clear… “Look!” said Becca, wide-eyed. “He’s—he’s—”\par
She choked off. “Oh…”\par
Most of his torso had gotten out of the way. But when the fist came up, it showed a meat paste of a lower body. Everything twisted the wrong way; every bone was shattered—so deformed, so brutalized it barely looked human anymore. It made you flinch just looking at it, made you hiss. It looked horribly painful— the most painful thing most of them had ever seen.\par
Every part of him that could be broken was broken. And yet it was still attached, all just intact enough you knew he was feeling every last bit of it; an excruciating torture. They saw Zane wince. They’d never seen him wince.\par
Then the darkness came over him again. The fist blotting out the sky… and this time he was stuck. There was no getting away.\par
Zane looked up.\par
He didn’t whimper. Didn’t wail, nor cry out, or curl up—the kinds of things those watching imagined he’d do; imagined they’d do in his place.\par
Instead Zane gritted his teeth. And stared straight into the abyss, defiant.\par
“Christ,” croaked Tyler.\par
There was so much pressure hovering over him it felt like a tangible, oppressive thing—the mind-bending pain, the specter of certain death, getting so badly shut down, brutally broken, splayed out against a literal Giant thirty Levels up—\par
It choked up the crowd.\par
But none of it could cloud Zane’s sight.\par
When he looked up, he saw something there no one else could see.\par
There was a light in his eyes—a very familiar light…\par
The fist fell.\par
And at the same time, Zane moved.\par
He smashed his hammer straight into the Colossus’s thigh. Not to damage it—to snare it, get ahold of it; he yanked. And flew straight up.\par
The falling arm came so close and nearly grazed him, so close you could see its black fires reflected in his intense eyes.\par
They went right past each other.\par
That giant arm smashed down one more time; he flew up, higher and higher, like he was shooting for the Colossus’s head—the huge Boss swiveled, clenched a fist, ready to bat him straight out the sky.\par
Then Zane’s other Smash made landfall. On the ground.\par
It struck a very particular spot. The same spot Zane kept looping back to.\par
The same spot he’d baited the Colossus into smashing—three times in a row.\par
The same chunk of bridge already riddled with fissures, sloughing off stone, teetering on the brink—\par
Stormfire raged into the ground. And tipped it over the edge.\par
The Colossus’ arm was halfway up a swat—then it staggered.\par
It frowned down at the ground.\par
There was an echoing CRACK!\par
A single jagged black line carved down the middle of the bridge…\par
And the whole thing split clean in two.\par
Then they were all falling—an avalanche of stone and steel and fire, all except Zane, shooting up as the battlefield went down. Then he fell too, tied as he was to the beast—one man riding a behemoth. Straight into the mouth of hell.\par
They struck lava.\par
The explosion whited out the world.\par
The projection went black.\par
Silence.\par
Then the Hell Array lit up. Zane Walker himself stumbled out, matted all over with sweat. He wiped one burly arm over his forehead. Then glanced to the leaderboard—\par
A new name climbed above all the rest, sitting at number one.\par
ZANE WALKER, 891 KILLS\par
The crowd went wild; there wasn’t a man woman and child left seated; Zane looked around baffled as thousands of the world’s strongest gave him a standing cheering ovation. The crowd surged, running at him, mobbing him—\par
“Zane Walker,” screamed Tyler, voice hoarse. “Planned that whole thing. From the moment he saw that first smash, he knew!”\par
He shook his head. “He stood in the shadow of death. He stared it down even as it fell on top of him, crushed him within an inch of his life—when it matters most, when the pressure’s at its greatest, Zane delivers! He found the needle in the haystack and threaded it through the eye of the storm—with a sliver of Health, he took out a Boss thirty Levels above! He had to execute perfectly. If that man flinched a single time, from pain, from fear, from doubt—it would’ve been over. But Zane Walker does not flinch!”\par
His voice cracked as he yelled. “That’s the meaning of his name right there! That’s the Savage Sage!”\par
Zane, who was still rather bemused about the whole thing, would later find out that last recording was the first essence recording to go truly viral.\par
In the far, far future—when many of those present in the crowd or watching around the world became big names, even legends in their own right, scattered to places very, very distant from Earth… they’d often be asked about Zane Walker. Every Earthling would have a story—it was pretty much impossible to come up on Earth around that time and not have something to say about him.\par
They’d chuckle, and think about the good old times, when the world was so much smaller and simpler, and reminisce.\par
For some, they’d cite the Eze fight. But most would cite this—this was the first time they realized they were seeing someone truly different. The first time they saw a glimmer of what he would become.\par
***\par
It took Zane a while to extricate himself. He didn’t manage to do it even in the street; he could only find refuge once he was back in the hotel.\par
He found a surprise visitor waiting for him in his room.\par
It was Reina. She was feeling a lot of intense things.\par
“Oh. Hey—” was all he got out. Then she was all over him.\par
Hours later, improbably, Mephisto’s Pleasure Sutra became his first official high-Level Skill.\par


\section{138. Next Steps}
\par
Apparently for Reina, watching him fight was incredibly stressful. Her heart was also overflowing with joy and pride. It was a lot.\par
She vented it on him for about four hours straight.\par
When they were done she rested her head on his chest, fast asleep. Her whole body was totally relaxed; she wore a gentle smile. He watched her for a bit—she fit so well with him. She was sprawled all over him; her soft curves just melted into him. Her chest slowly rose and fell, squished up against him; he gently stroked the dark tresses of her hair. They were both glistening with sweat.\par
After that... he was pretty confident she wasn’t waking anytime soon.\par
But he was still lively. He wasn’t about to go comprehend anything—he was still burned out on comprehension. But maybe he could take in some treasures, do a stint in the sauna. Just be out and about.\par
This time he extracted himself slowly and gently. And it was the rare time he was actually successful. He left her hugging three pillows. Her instincts kicked in; she got possessive.\par
Reina seemed a very smart and logical person most of the time—and she was. But once he got to know her he realized she also had very strong drives and feelings… it was just that most of the time, the first part of her kept the second part in check.\par
When she was sleeping or drowsy that second part took control—she just wanted to snuggle and kiss him and never let him go. But this time she was so exhausted she didn’t stir, to his relief.\par
He managed to wiggle his way out.\par
Well—what now? He stood there in the hallway—the gold-wallpapered, red-velvet carpet hallway—and blinked.\par
He figured he’d go for the Electricity Law soon, once he was done recovering.\par
It had been a while since he checked his stats...\par

Even he hadn’t expected to jump three Levels from one Array run—on top of all his Skill levels. But he did take out a Level 140 Boss. Made sense.\par
He went down the elevator, strode into the swanky lobby. It looked like something out of a 19th century European mansion. The floor was a glossy white marble. Above, a chandelier the size of a Christmas tree tinkled gently.\par
The moment he came in it was like all the air was sucked out of the room. Heads turned instantly. Eyes popped.\par
By now things had settled down some, though—when he turned up his ‘Do-Not-Disturb’ aura they stared and whispered but they left him alone, thankfully. It wasn’t that different to before. It seemed like he was close to ‘peak fame’, to his relief. This level was manageable at least.\par
Just then, he felt another strong aura behind him. Reserved, tightly controlled—quite familiar. Zane didn’t even have to turn to know who it was.\par
“Zane Walker,” said Eze with a soft smile. He was dressed in dark form-fitting combat robes, plain yet elegant. “Off to training?”\par
Zane nodded. “To the Soul Sauna, probably.”\par
Eze grunted. “By the way—I must congratulate you. Quite the performance.”\par
“Thanks.”\par
“Are you busy, by chance?”\par
“No.”\par
Eze gestured over to stand of wicker seats with a little wooden table between them. “Shall we sit, then? I’ve something I’ve been meaning to discuss with you.”\par
They were both a little too big for the seats—the seats were meant for normal-sized people. They had to perch a little over the sides. Eze made it look effortless, like that was how you were meant to sit on it all along. He crossed his legs, steepled his fingers. And treated Zane to a curious gaze.This tale has been unlawfully lifted without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.\par
“I assume,” he said. “Electricity’s next for you.”\par
Zane grunted.\par
“Tell me—what is that Fusion you seek precisely? Fire and Electricity... I’ve done a good deal of study on the various paths. But I haven’t come across that one.”\par
Zane saw no harm in telling him. “Stormfire.”\par
“Stormfire,” said Eze, nodding thoughtfully. “I believe this is one of the rarer paths. I’ve heard of the common ones. Tell me—have you formed the initial stage of the Fusion? If you’ve managed a Concept… “\par
Zane just blinked at him.\par
“... You don’t know what that is,” said Eze, blinking.\par
“No.”\par
“That… makes sense.” Eze paused. “Your Stormfire is powerful. But had you achieved true initial Fusion, you would have crushed me. And the Array. With ease.”\par
Zane frowned. “Explain?”\par
“To know Fusions, you must first know Concepts,” mused Eze. He tapped a finger to his lip. “Concepts govern the interactions between Elements. Take, for instance, the little water demon. She wishes to fuse Water and Light. There is a Fusion of those two Elements called ‘Mirage.’ But to achieve even the simplest Fusion, the most basic Mirage Law, one must understand how light passes through water. Which means one must understand the Concept of ‘Refraction.’”\par
“Huh.”\par
“Or say—Core Magma, which is Fire plus Earth. You must first understand Phase Change. The way liquids and solids interact. Then there are the more advanced Concepts relating to geothermal powers.”\par
“I see,” said Zane. “How do you know all this?”\par
“I research,” said Eze simply. “Back home I maintain a collection of rare texts. I’ve also acquired portions of various Inheritances of the Nine Great Factions of this galaxy—at great cost. But I find it’s been worth it.”\par
“Nine Great Factions.”\par
“You’ve seen the names. World Tree Faction. Azure Flame Faction. Mount Steelheart. And so on.”\par
Zane nodded.\par
“One can find parts of their Inheritances through loot in dungeons. Or by trade. I only have certain fragments, but even so I’ve gleaned a great deal...”\par
He paused—a Silicon Coven attendant had come to check up on them, asking if they wanted anything. Eze ordered ‘Moonflower Tea’. Zane asked for plain spirit spring water.\par
“So,” said Zane. “These... Concepts. Tell me more.”\par
“Simply put, they are the next building blocks of Law,” said Eze. “They must be comprehended to make Fusions. They are what tie the strands of Elements Law together to make new divergent shapes. There are many ways to combine water and light—it needn’t be Mirage. What makes this specific Fusion are the Concepts particular to Mirage. They trace the shape of the Fusion...the more Mirage Concepts you incorporate, the more powerful the Fusion. The complete Fusion incorporates every Concept of the Mirage.”\par
Zane nodded. That did make sense. So for him, they’d be Concepts of Stormfire. He wondered what that meant.\par
“It seems you have me at a disadvantage,” said Eze, pursing his lips. “You’ve managed some initial form of Fusion—without Concepts. How is that?”\par
And Zane told him about pseudo-Stormfire.\par
“Fascinating,” said Eze. He mulled it over for a few seconds. “At present I’m trying to fuse Earth and Darkness. The Law of the Abyss, it’s called. For hours a day I immerse myself in the deepest bowels of the earth I can find, in total darkness. In an attempt to touch upon a certain Abyss Concept—‘Nullification.’”\par
He shook his head. “It has been devilishly difficult. And I have the advantage of an Inheritance, an A-rank tome which maps the foundational Concepts of the Abyss. It was left by a Sage of the ‘Deep Earth Hall’... I have but a fraction of it the first portion. But it’s already been invaluable to me. I suspect the alien Factions have every Fusion path thoroughly mapped out.”\par
He took a sip of wine.\par
“This first tome alone makes reference to hundreds of powerhouses who’ve walked the Abyss path, across millennia... though they appear to have had Law resources unavailable here on Earth. Here I must resort to mere caverns.” He wrinkled his nose.\par
Zane just listened and nodded, soaking it in.\par
“The tome claims,” continued Eze. “That one Concept may take a decade to learn. Even for the talented. I find a good heuristic for these texts is to divide their timescales by about a factor of one hundred. Without some external aid—some bespoke Law treasure, perhaps—it could be weeks before I comprehend this Concept. Perhaps months. For you... with the right materials. The right environment. The right guidance? I suspect it’ll take about a week.”\par
“Hm.”\par
“The difficulty is in achieving all of those.” Eze shook his head. “The work is not easy, either way. But it is significantly easier when you have an Inheritance to work off of... Your Fusion. It’s called ‘Stormfire,’ yes?”\par
“That’s right.”\par
Eze nodded. “It’s quite likely there’s a Tome that maps your path. Once you achieve Elemental Electricity and begin exploring your Concepts, I’d see if I can find a copy somewhere. Otherwise... it’ll feel like climbing a sheer cliff without a foothold.”\par
“I will,” said Zane. “...How?”\par
“Luck.” Eze shrugged. “Or perhaps... in a few weeks, they are holding an ‘Auction.’ ‘The Merchant’s Guild’—I know very little about it, but you can try your luck with them. Though I should say—it will likely prove expensive. I would raid at least one A-rank dungeon before you do. The dungeon chest alone is a trove of high-grade Essence Stones.”\par
Zane nodded. He’d gotten that Merchant’s Guild Token months ago, way back in the Abyssal Crater up in Washington; he was wondering when he’d get a chance to use it. \par
Eze stood, gave a little smile. “On that note. I have a certain Mythic-grade Inheritance Skill to comprehend…”\par
He paused.\par
“I suspect,” he said. “Once I grasp this, my Combat strength will drastically increase. I also plan on taking four A-grade Vials of Essence. Then we shall see about the Asura Hell Array. You may have the lead now, my friend. But don’t be complacent—or you may find it vanishing before your very eyes.”\par
“Don’t worry. I won’t be.”\par
They shared a look. Smiled a little.\par
Then Eze left, and Zane sat there. There was much to think about.\par
***\par
It was getting to be early morning by then. First he went to the sauna and got in a good stint relaxing, recovering. He’d spend most of this time here for the next two days.\par
When he came out around noon and passed through the Warrior Dojo lobby, a few young men were brave enough to come up to him despite his ‘I will bite’ aura. They asked him for an autograph; their eyes were shining—they kind of reminded him of Evan. So Zane obliged.\par
This turned out to be a big mistake. Soon everyone came after him—he had to resort to glowering to make them go away again. He just couldn’t afford it anymore; especially now, he’d be mobbed everywhere he went.\par
As he went back to the hotel, even the security guard—who was meant to keep away all the fans—asked him for an autograph.\par
***\par
He went out for lunch with Reina. Then Evan caught up with him for desert—he’d baked Zane another cake to celebrate getting \#1 on the Hell Array. Nobody knew where he was getting the ingredients from. Evan was inexplicably good at baking cakes.\par
According to Evan, Avery was still breaking through in the Light Law Area.\par
Zane gave Reina a Kiss; she went off to finish up her Wood Laws. Now that they were set to clear an A-rank dungeon together, she was putting a lot more time and focus into it. As well as A-rank treasures. Her comprehension was pretty darn fast—not Avery-fast, but still quite good. She was more than halfway through her Wood Laws; a few more days and she’d be ready for Elemental.\par
She said it hadn’t been this way before her Signature Title. But it’d boosted her talent a lot.\par
Over lunch, Zane had told her about what Eze said, and she’d thought it over. Then she also decided the Auction was the best bet. She made a quick trip back to Headquarters to set up a mandate. For the next few weeks, three-quarters of the Luminous Faction’s earnings—and a good chunk of its treasury—would go to Zane’s Auction fund.\par
When one of the council-members protested she shut him down with a five-pronged argument about why it was a critical Faction security measure that they made absolutely sure Zane got his treasure.\par
The problem with arguing with her was even when you knew she just wanted to pamper Zane—which was pretty clear to everyone, including Zane—she backed it with such airtight arguments it was hard to deny her. \par


\section{139. The Elemental Law of Electricity (I) }
\par
Zane did another stint in the sauna. He came out feeling raw and sore—in a good way. It meant his soul was healing.\par
After that he had the rest of the afternoon off.\par
By then he got the news that Avery had broken through to Elemental Light; she tried announcing it to him by wrapping herself in a light mirage and sneaking up on him.\par
This did not work.\par
Partly because he could sense her coming with Sage Mind. Partly because Evan blew her cover by coming up to him and saying, “Hi! Avery wants me to distract you! Could you please not look behind you for a bit?”\par
Zane turned around and said, “Boo.”\par
There was a shriek.\par
Then the shimmer of light behind him unraveled and there was Avery looking grumpy.\par
She quickly recovered.\par
“I broke through too!” she said, grinning. She tossed a ball of light around as proof.\par
***\par
Afterwards they went for a nice afternoon walk. Well—Zane was walking. Evan scampered right behind.\par
“Chaaaarge!!” cried Avery, waving her arm like a general pointing at a battlefield. She tugged on Zane’s hair.\par
Zane kept going forward.\par
She tugged more insistently.\par
Zane sighed and turned left.\par
Avery peered over at him. Which meant she had to lean over and look at him upside down, squinting. “You’re gonna have to be faster about it when we actually ride into battle,” she said.\par
“That will never happen,” grumbled Zane.\par
She stuck her tongue out at him.\par
They kept going, taking in the place—neatly-kept dirt roads spiraling off in random directions, the manicured lines of trees, the glittering vastness of the San Francisco Bay, dappled orange-gold by the mid-afternoon sun.\par
“So!” said Avery, pattering his head like a bongo. “Did Evan tell you yet?”\par
“What?”\par
“We’re making a rescue team!” said Evan excitedly.\par
“What’s that?”\par
“You know how lots of dungeons are reverting now? And it’s getting faster and faster?” said Avery. “Well people are getting stuck in them! Especially the high-ranking ones. Sometimes whole Factions get caught in ’em! After VGI, we’re gonna go around and save them.”\par
“That’s right!” said Evan.\par
“Wanna come?” said Avery.\par
“Ooh! Please?” said Evan. He blinked up at Zane with his big sky-blue eyes.\par
“Hm.” Zane frowned. He had other plans, though. With Reina. “I don’t think so.”\par
“Aww...” said Evan, drooping.\par
“Don’t worry about it,” said Avery, nodding as though she’d expected it. “He’ll come around to it. The big fella’s very tsundere about saving people.”\par
“...What,” said Zane.\par
“Ohhhh,” said Evan. He nodded. “That makes sense.”\par
Zane frowned. “What?”\par
“Nothing,” said Avery.\par
“... It’s because Reina and I are going to clear A-rank dungeons,” Zane rumbled.\par
“Ahh. Hm.” Avery paused. “Hey, how about this? You two can go do that, and we’ll go around doing rescue team stuff! And once it’s time to tackle the S-ranks, we can meet up again.”\par
“Sure. That works.”\par
***\par
Nowadays once he’d been out in public for a prolonged period, people began to notice. A crowd started gathering along the side of the street, watching him getting piggyback-ridden. They watched from a distance, ooh-ing like they were tourists seeing a lion on the savannah or something. He even spotted those reporters with the crystal microphones pulling up.\par
…He wasn’t even doing anything.\par
Avery, meanwhile, was eating it up. She waved cheerfully. “Hello!” she called to the crowd. “You may be wondering what’s going on here. Let me fill you in! I, the great and mighty Avery Lively, have defeated Zane Walker in battle! I thereafter claimed him as my loyal mount. From now on—eeeee!”\par
Zane grabbed her by the leg and was now dangling her upside down in front of him. He gave her a dry look.\par
“Don’t push it.”\par
She nodded slowly. “Point taken—hey why’re you putting me back down? The ride’s not over yet!”This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.\par
“You have lost your piggyback riding privileges.”\par
“…Drat.”\par
***\par
They ambled out onto a ridge overlooking the bay. Sunshine washed the whole place gold. Evan gasped, stun-locked.\par
There was a behemoth of a ship docked on the distant sandy shores. Big white sails puffed out despite the lack of wind. The hull was patterned with the biggest runes Zane had ever seen. It was all wood but still very impressive—like something straight out of a 15th-century armada. A strong aura of Law swirled around it.\par
He saw a yawning teenager in a paint-splattered T-shirt walking up the gangway—Yuki Urabe, the Japanese top Wold Ranker. Then there was Somsak, the fierce-looking guy with the headband right behind him. A bunch of other Signed followed behind him, getting on board too.\par
“That’s the Asia team!” said Avery. “They’re out to clear a bunch of A-rank dungeons. There’s this big stretch of ocean—it’s this super long strip going right down the Pacific. There’s this kraken there screwing up all the trade routes, they’re gonna go smack it first. Then take on Mount Fuji, and circle down South Korea and China right after.”\par
Zane grunted.\par
Things were getting underway. The World Clear Percentage had risen near 90\% lately, but it’d slowed a lot. For a few days there it even slipped back a few percentage points. Avery was right—lots of C- and B-rank dungeons were reverting; the damage was spilling into other Safe Zones too...\par
“A bunch of Scandinavians are doing a mission up to the North Pole,” said Avery. “The South American team’s going for the South Pole too. I wonder what’s down there... giant evil penguins?”\par
Evan had zoned out up until then; he was too busy staring at the cool boat. Then he heard the word’ penguin,’ gasped, and instantly snapped back. “I love penguins!”\par
After VGI, Eze planned on going back to Africa and leading the effort to clear the A-ranks there. There were hardly any major Faction wars going on anymore, which was something you couldn’t say a few months ago. The whole world was kind of coming together.\par
Zane would use his last few days here well. See if he could finish off Elemental Electricity.\par
Then he and Reina would join in too.\par
First stop, that L.A. Dungeon.\par
He clenched a fist.\par
A-rank, S-rank—and beyond… they were pushing up near the edge of something big. Something looming just over the horizon… they could all feel it coming. When it struck, he’d be ready.\par
***\par
After that they all went their separate ways. Then Zane was on his way back to the Warrior Dojo to do another stint in the sauna. On the way, though—“Hey there! Zane! Zane Walker! Wait up!”\par
Zane recognized that voice. He kept walking.\par
The voice kept shouting. He still kept walking.\par
It wasn’t until Elias skidded to a halt right in front of him that he stopped. And even then Zane briefly thought about running the guy over.\par
“Do you know,” said Elias, gasping a little, “How much you’ve cost me these past few days? That—That stunt with Eze, breaking the King of the Ring—that was a hundred high-grade essence stones, I’ll have you know! And the Asura Hell Array, good grief—you weren’t supposed to make it that high! Do you have any clue how expensive simulating the Ninth Layer is?! We don’t even have the technical expertise to keep the dang thing running!”\par
“Okay,” said Zane.\par
Elias studied him. “You don’t care, do you?” he sighed. “How heartless! You’re my crown jewel, you know—my first draft pick! I’ve given you so much. Not an ounce of appreciation! Though that’s the lot of us investors, I suppose…the most generous of people! But always slighted, under-appreciated, maligned…”\par
“Are you done?” said Zane dryly.\par
Elias cleared his throat. “…Just about. Seriously, though—the Hell Array’s been run a few too many times. And no-one here’s got the rune Skills to fix it! Right now runs are limited to Top 30 World Rankers. After today, we’re only letting two people give it a shot. Eze, and you! At least you lot bring in viewers.”\par
He shook his head, grumbling. “Even so. Two more runs for you, tops! Then we’ll have to shut it down for a bit. The thing’s got some self-repairing capabilities—but not if you two maniacs push it to its limits every day!”\par
“Fine.”\par
“You’ve got no clue how expensive this thing’s been to run,” said Elias, tapping a foot. “You know that Soul Sauna you’re using every day? The ‘Yellow Spring Mists’—the stuff we use to power it? It costs an arm and a leg! You can’t even imagine how much I should be charging you for that! That contract of yours… your girl’s a piece of work, I tell you!” He wagged a finger at Zane.\par
“I know,” said Zane proudly.\par
Elias suddenly froze, paled, looked over his shoulder. “… She’s not here, is she?”\par
“No.”\par
Elias let out a relieved breath. It was kind of funny to Zane how he treated Reina like the boogeyman.\par
Then Elias rubbed his temples. “Well. I will say this! We’ve made a killing off those streaming licensing deals. And after that bout you had, you won’t believe how many World Rankers have been in contact to come do a stint here. Can’t be too upset about it, I suppose. Can’t be too upset...”\par
Now he was talking to himself. “Yes, yes. At the end of the day, it’s just another investment, isn’t it?”\par
He inspected Zane and nodded, like a horse racer inspecting his best purebred stallion.\par
“...”\par
“Yes,” said Elias, satisfied. “In the end it should all pay off... happy Leveling! And please, dear god, be a little gentler with my treasures!”\par
***\par
That evening Zane and Reina did their usual activities and he went to sleep.\par
He started to dream. He dreamed he was holding his favorite pillow. It was squishy and soft and quite round in places. He liked holding this pillow.\par
The pillow began to wriggle.\par
He frowned. It was getting away. He hugged tighter. It was still getting out.\par
Then he flopped over it, squishing it with his whole body. The pillow let out a wheeze and went still.\par
He smiled and kept sleeping.\par
He woke up some time later to find Reina squished flat underneath him. She just lay there, spread-eagled. She had accepted her fate.\par
Wincing, he got off her.\par
“...Sorry.”\par
“’s fine,” she gasped.\par
***\par
One final stint in the Soul Sauna and he was ready.\par
Electricity Law time.\par
The Silicon Coven’s Electricity Law area was called Storm’s Birth. It stood on the highest peak on campus, a little removed from the main causeway. The peak stood bright and sharp, shrouded in a purple-black cloud crackling white lightning. From afar it looked like a lightning rod stuck in a stormcloud.\par
A bunch of steel monoliths made the outer edge, shooting streams of power up. Up into the low circle of clouds hugging the peak, swirling with heavy howling winds.\par
The air felt tingly as Zane neared, vibrating on his skin. The place was fenced off, but Zane just walked on through, past the line. No-one stopped him. They mostly gawked—the line, and the guards.\par
He barely registered the crowd quickly forming behind him. He did notice, though, a crew with a giant glass pointed at them—it was that film crew, the same good-looking man and woman. It used to take them an hour or so to get here. Today he couldn’t have been out for fifteen minutes. They’d gotten their recording crystals set up. They were dressed up and everything too. They noticed him looking and blushed.\par
…At least they kept a respectful distance.\par
He downed his usual Law Fruit. Got out that A-rank Lightning treasure—\par
Lightning Lotus Seed (A)\par
Lightning Lotuses bloom in the Peak Gardens of Mount Thundercrest during the Everstorm—a once-in-a-millennium celestial event in which tribulation lightning strikes for ninety-nine days straight. At the end of it, each Lotus Seed is deeply saturated with pure Electricity Law. When consumed they grant massive boons in essence and Electricity Law.\par
And waded up the gravelly mountain path.\par
He’d run through these Laws as fast as he could.\par


\section{140. The Elemental Law of Electricity (II) }
\par
There was nothing green to be seen—the mountaintop barren, scarred over, a rugged expanse of gray stone lashed with black. Lightning cracked down, dispersing, splattering white arcs over the darkness.\par
The clouds swirling overhead looked like a whirlpool gone upside-down, murky, churning purples and grays and deep-blues. The deeper it went, the brighter the lightning crackled.\par
Zane had just one Electricity Law. Discharge. It did a little to fend off the Elemental Electricity as he waded into the chaos.\par
Like the other Law Areas there were layers to this one. Leading all the way to the mountain peak. He started at the outermost layer—it threw up a stiff breeze, but that was all. Gentle electric currents threaded the air, giving light shocks here and there. He walked right through them. Steel and Fire warded them off.\par
It wasn't just Steel Body; just having two Elemental Laws in his essence, in his aura, gave him some defense. A little insulation.\par
He made his way through to the second layer. The ground here was studded all over with brilliant white crystals. They acted like lightning rods, soaking in the shocks, scattering them out when they overflowed.\par
High above the clouds were thickening, darkening. The lightning struck brighter, fiercer, cracked harder—\par
By the time he was nearing the peak the wind had picked up to a full howling blast. You could feel Elemental Electricity everywhere, charging the air—tingling down the skin, almost tangible, hugging his skin like a fuzzy wool coat. The ground grew hot under his feet.\par
The strikes grew stronger too but he didn't really need to take notice; they felt like little more than static shocks to him. Unpleasant, but okay. Until—\par
CRACK!\par
A bolt from the blue, and he stood there stunned. He froze for a moment, locked-up; he felt his heart skip a beat. Then he was alright, gasping a little. He blinked, frowned up at the brooding swirling sky. That one actually managed to chip some Health off him.\par
Zane considered it. It had a kind of… whip-speed to it, a crack, the fire didn't. And when it struck him one place it hit everywhere at once; it just needed a single point… he nodded, fascinated. That could certainly strengthen his Stormfire nicely.\par
He kept going deeper.\par
He's nearly reached the peak now. Fat bolts of lightning kept striking there, an endless march of blinding flashes. There was a faint smell of sulfur. Streaks of glass lay scattered about, strewn between charred stones. He wondered what that was about.\par
Then he saw it.\par
Lightning struck a strip of gravel, smote it in a blazing rush; it was so bright he had to blink. CRACK!\par
When he looked again the gravel had been turned to glass.\par
Then a bolt just as fat struck him. And he locked up again.\par
Electricity didn't hurt as much as Fire. It was just annoying—paralyzing. And much harder to block.\par
By the time he stood five feet from the peak he was drawing some real bombs. Intense searing streaks of fat white lightning rippling through him, locking up his jaw, his arms, making him spasm, making every step a jerk. It was just ripping right through him—it didn't care about his defenses. He found it very intriguing even as he jerked and stiffened. The pain was a little thing; his curiosity was much bigger.\par
He sat down. Got out the A-rank treasure, Lightning Lotus Seed. And nodded.\par
Let's do this.\par
He swallowed it in one gulp.\par
It sizzled down his throat; he felt it all the way down—then it felt like a bomb exploding in his gut. Pulsing constantly, throwing out reams upon reams of lightning. It might've been bad if he did this Law first—or if he wasn't a good ways into Foundation already. But right now all he felt was bad indigestion.\par
That was the thing about this Electricity. It was just wild energy; when put in a Skill it might hurt a lot more. Right now, though, it was kind of tempering his insides.\par
Skill up!\par
Man of Steel III -> IV\par
Hey. Nice.\par
Suddenly that indigestion faded to a mild ache.\par
He felt a sudden incredible sensitivity; when he reached out with his soul it was like every speck of Electricity, every bit of charge, screamed out at him—stood out bright in his field of consciousness. Everything else faded away, lost color…Stolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.\par
He started eyes open.\par
Law visions were good for comprehension, sure. But he noticed comprehension was even easier when you felt it directly; when you experienced it there and then. So he just looked, noticed. There was plenty of Electricity all around, overwhelming. It was hard choosing where to start.\par
He was drawn to the way lightning moved through air. It went from one thing to another, making it jagged path… a starting point, an ending point. Between them, an arc rippling through air. A connection; a jagged, unstable leap. You couldn't hold this element in place. It had an itchiness to it, a hyper-activeness.\par
The shortest way between two points was a line. But a line was predictable. Electricity never was. He sat there watching it in almost childlike wonder; he let himself fade away until he wasn't seeing the light, just the essence. And the Law guiding it underneath… the way the arcs flashed jagged, those strange wonderful shapes searing into his eyes, his mind…\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Electric Arc\par
Then he observed the end of it. How it made contact—the instantaneous burst. It reminded him of combustion and fire, but a little different; combustion was more drawn out; it started fiercest, bloomed outward. This burst was the end of the journey, a single devastating moment. He watched lighting strike stone again and again…heard the CRACK, the crash of it, the rush of heat at every burst…\par
Sometimes knowing one Law—even one from a totally unrelated Element—helped know another. This one came very easily.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Lightning Strike\par
Then Zane looked to the beginning, to the sky, those thick dark clouds—to the power jumping, shivering within them. Like a fertile ground for electric powers… he kept watching, noticing, feeling its inner workings… The instability was what gave it its strength, weirdly. Electricity needed to careen from one pole to another. Something clicked.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Charged Chaos\par
Then a full picture was forming in his mind. Altogether it made those most volatile, unpredictable shocking parts of Electricity; the powers that gave birth to thunderbolts.\par
Law comprehended!\par
Major Law of Storm's Fury\par
He was in a good flow today; it felt like the world was just rushing into him. But he didn’t rest.\par
He shifted gears instantly. Started focusing on the way it coursed through him. What instantly fascinated him about this Element—what he thought could make some of the most difference to his Stormfire—was how it seemed to hit everything at once. Strike one spot and it spread in an instant; not just over the surface, but through the middle too; it really did hit everything.\par
And right now the Lightning Lotus Seed’s powers made for a perfect example. He focused on the way each little spark zapped through all of him. It wasn't truly instantaneous, he saw—but it might as well be. That penetrating, voraciously spreading property…\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Conductive Paths\par
But it didn't just stay in him. It flowed out too, carrying across the air, jumping to steel, to glass, to gravel, to stone, stretching out thin claws of light. It didn't need something physical. It could jump to anything and everything—\par
Law comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Field Jumping\par
But some things resisted more than others. When it struck ground for instance, especially certain kinds of stone, it bit the dust—burrowed in and vanished. It was kind of that way with essence too. The more essence there was, the harder it was to tear through… it was why even though none of Zane's Laws countered Electricity, he still felt a layer of protection.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Arcane insulation.\par
Then there was how the Electricity stayed within him, gathered in the steel. He sensed some of the seed's Electricity making its home in his body; he saw it outside, too—how lightning stayed in those crystals on the ground, just sizzling… storing…\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Minor Law of Battery Powers\par
And then he had his second Major Law of the day. The way Electricity moved instantly through all things, natural and magical.\par
Law Comprehended!\par
Major Law of Arcane Conduction\par
Strange—he felt he had a little more in him today. He could feel exhaustion lurking at the edge of his mind, but he could do… two more Minor Laws, maybe? Before it swamped him. He figured it was a matter of experience. Some of those Minor Laws felt like hearing a song he knew, just played on a different instrument.\par
There was probably something deeper there. A hint of how everything eventually came together.\par
Or maybe he was just a little delirious.\par
His last level wasn't a Skill Level. It came from all the essence in the seed—\par
Level up!\par
Essence Level 110 -> 111\par
He stood. He'd save some of himself for today, do a few stints in the sauna. Finish it off tomorrow, he decided. After he overdrew his soul last time he figured a little restraint was okay. He’d just carry it over to the next session.\par
***\par
When he went outside, he saw hundreds of heads instantly turn to him. The reporters were still there; he them yapping away as he passed—he caught little snippets of it. They seem to be speculating how many Major Laws he'd just gotten.\par
“We know we know an A10 Soul Talent can do one Major Law and two Minor Laws a day!” the male reporter was saying. “But as we all know, Zane Walker’s the only known S-rank Soul Talent. Could it be he can do one Major Law and four Minor Laws?”\par
“Five, even?!” said the woman. “Our statisticians have analyzed the footage, and our best guesses put it at one-point-eight Major Laws a day, plus minus zero-point-three! Which means we could very well be seeing a breakthrough in the next few days!”\par
Zane blinked.\par
…\par
It reminded him of those reality television shows. Or like sports commentator talking heads. Except he couldn’t understand how anyone could find this interesting.\par
He thought about correcting them, then figured it was pointless. He went back to the sauna.\par
He didn’t bother upgrading all his Skills yet; he’d do it once he got the full Elemental Law.\par
***\par
The next few days he settled into a routine. He spent some time in the Soul Sauna. Went on some nice walks with Evan. Readied himself for the final push. He ended up Leveling up twice with Reina’s help; another thing that made them unusually effective was how long they could both go for. Reina was a trooper—she liked to go until she couldn’t take it anymore. It meant a lot of essence.\par
She’d been bottlenecked at Level 99 for a few days now. But her Elemental Law was almost done too.\par
***\par
Two days after his last try he came back to the Electricity Law Area.\par
If all went to plan, by the end of the day Elemental Electricity—and because of it, the highest grade of pseudo-Stormfire—would be his.\par
